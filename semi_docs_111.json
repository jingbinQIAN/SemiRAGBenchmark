Chemical treatment of the silicon surface may be required to produce a reliable Schottky barrier diode.2 The surface treatment chemistries are different for n- and $p$ -type wafers.

This test method includes descriptions of fixtures for measuring substrates with or without an insulating backseal layer. 2.4 The depth of the region that can be profiled depends on the doping level in the test specimen. Based on data reported by Severin2 and Grove,3 Figure 1 shows the relationships between depletion depth, dopant density, and applied voltage together with the breakdown voltage of a mercury silicon contact. The test specimen can be profiled from approximately the depletion depth corresponding to an applied voltage of $1 ~ \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ to the depletion depth corresponding to the maximum applied voltage $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ or about $80 \\%$ of the breakdown voltage, whichever is lower).

It must be emphasized that the use of a poor Schottky contact does not actually prevent a carrier density determination but produces an erroneous result. 3.2 Improper determination of the compensation capacitance, $C _ { c o m p }$ , (see Section 10.3) can cause significant errors in the capacitance measurement. In homogeneous material, improper zeroing or use of an improper value for $C _ { c o m p }$ results in an apparent monotonic increase or decrease of carrier density with distance from the Schottky barrier. In some fixtures, inherently large stray capacitances exist; in such cases, the value of $C _ { c o m p }$ may depend both on the diameter of the wafer and on the position of the wafer on the chuck.

These changes can also provide an important process monitoring function.  \n1.4 This test method is suitable for measuring the sori of wafers used in semiconductor device processing in the as-sliced, lapped, etched, polished, epitaxial or other layer condition and for monitoring thermal and mechanical effects on the sori of wafers during device processing."

Sori is a measure of the distortion of the front surface of the wafer. 2.5 This test method measures sori of a wafer corrected for mechanical forces applied during the test. Therefore, the procedure described gives the unconstrained value of sori. NOTE 1: This sori is indicated by the acronym “GFLYFER” in Appendix 2, Shape Decision Tree, of SEMI M1. 2.6 This test method includes several methods for canceling"

Vibration of the test specimen relative to the probemeasuring axis will introduce error. Such errors are minimized by system signature analysis and correction algorithms. Internal system monitoring may also be used to correct non-repetitive and repetitive system mechanical translations. Failure to provide such corrections may cause errors. 3.2 If a measured wafer differs substantially in diameter, thickness, fiducials, or crystal orientation from that used for the gravitational compensation procedure, the results may be incorrect. Estimates of the errors in gravity induced deflection for differences in diameter and thickness are shown in Related Information 1. If the crystal orientation of the sample to be measured differs from the crystal orientation of the gravity-compensation wafer, then the measured sori value may differ from the actual"

Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: 4.1 Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the technique. Monochromatic X rays from an X-ray source impinge the surface of a polished silicon substrate at a glancing angle that is below the angle for total external reflection of the X rays. The evanescent wave of the $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ rays penetrates the polished silicon surface with an exponential decay of intensity versus depth dependent upon the total electron density of the native oxide and the silicon substrate. One exponential decay length is approximately $5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ for silicon of all resistivity. 4.2 The evanescent wave excites the fluorescence energy levels of the surface atoms which then emit fluorescence X-rays characteristic of their atomic number.

Calibration Standard\n\nContent: 11.1 The calibration standard and the method of its preparation must be agreed upon between the parties. NOTE 1—Several methods for preparing calibration standards are in practice. 8 The present state-of-the-art calibration standard is a chem-mechanical polished silicon substrate with a surface metal areal density of between 1 by $1 0 ^ { 1 2 }$ and 1 by $1 0 ^ { 1 4 }$ atoms $/ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ located in the analysis area. The $k$ -alpha fluorescence signal from the calibration standard metal is free of interferences, that is, escape peaks, sum peaks, and fluorescence peaks from other contamination, and free from external contamination sources. The preferred element should not be easily added as a contaminated element (for example, iron) or diffuse away from the analyte depth over time (for example, gold or copper). The preferred element is nickel or vanadium. Calibration can also be done using a set of wafers with different"

The calibration standard should have been measured by an appropriate analytical method to determine the metal areal density of the calibration metal. Some analytical methods which have been used for assigning quantitative values to calibration standards include: (a) Nitrogen-Beam Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (N-RBS)—If this method is used, there should not be any other metals present at levels greater than $1 \\%$ of the calibration metal areal density within a mass range of $\\pm 5$ atomic mass unit. The N-RBS measurement is absolute and must be made within the analysis area of the TXRF. Other backscattering methods are also used to calibrate elemental areal densities. These include forward scattering Rutherford backscattering (F-RBS) and heavy ion backscattering spectrometry (HIBS). (b) Vapor Phase Decomposition—This followed by atomic absorption spectrometry (VPD/AAS) is used"

An error in the elemental recovery rate of VPD is a source of error in accuracy. (c) Implant—Ion implant the reference element into a pre-amorphized silicon surface and using solid phase epitaxy to regrow the amorphous silicon into crystal silicon. This procedure sweeps the ion implanted reference element to the sample surface if the reference element is much more soluble in the amorphous silicon than in the crystal silicon.

Many types of instrumentation used for making resistivity measurements including the noncontact eddy-current instruments used for measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF673, DIN 50445, or DIN 50447 require calibration because they are relative measurements. Although measurements made with in-line four-point probes in accordance with SEMI MF84 or DIN 50441 are, in principle, absolute, control charts should be maintained for four-point probes because one cannot always be sure that the electrical resistivity of the test specimen is sufficiently homogeneous for the theoretical model of the method to apply, that the electrical thickness of the wafer is exactly equal to its measured mechanical thickness, or that the stability of the instrument is adequate. 1.2"
