Unreliable execution or failures may occur as a result of ATE specification tradeoff that typically exists between minimum pulse width and drive signal amplitude. This can be especially true when operation is in conjunction with complex formats such as SBC. This condition is a result of specification limitations inherent in the system under evaluation. Be advised that failure conditions can occur for systems with inadequate minimum pulse width and/or inadequate comparator bandwidth characteristics operating this procedure at high frequencies with complex formats. 13.3 It is necessary to note that data in Table 1 for any particular test represents minimum and maximum values taken for all"

Be aware, deltas under broad conditions may be greater than deltas for a focused condition. This specification is defined to provide results for the broad case. 13.4 When entering your analysis r esults to Table 2 Single Point Overall Timing Accuracy (OTA), be advised that the Single Point OTA Result is represented only as indicated in Table 2, the sum of Drive Input to Compare Output Timing, Drive Input Timing Delay Error, and Compare Output Time Delay Error.

MI- Measured RMS instrumentation jitter. AS- Actual RMS signal jitter. A4-3 Example A4-3.1 Measured RMS signal jitter MS, the signal being measured, results in a 10ps measurement. A4-3.2 Measured RMS instrumentation jitter MI, the jitter of the measurement setup, results in a 5ps measurement. A4-3.3 The actual RMS signal jitter AS is determined from the relationship: $$ \\mathrm { M S } = \\mathrm { M I } ^ { 2 } + \\mathrm { A S } ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ and calculates to be: $$ \\begin{array} { l } { 1 0 ^ { 2 } = 5 ^ { 2 } + \\mathrm { A S } ^ { 2 } } \\\\ { 1 0 0 = 2 5 + \\mathrm { A S } ^ { 2 } } \\\\ { 7 5 = \\mathrm { A S } ^ { 2 } } \\\\ { 7 5 ^ { 1 / 2 } = \\mathrm { A S } } \\end{array} $$"

The input signal is routed through the loopthrough sampling head where it is sampled and sent to the output of the sampling head. The head output is connected to the oscilloscope trigger. (See Figure A4- 3.) A4-4.2 What is Observed When Making MS And MI Measurements — This dialog is meant to provide further clarification for making jitter measurements. This is an example that applies to a jitter measurement using an oscilloscope with an inherent oscilloscope delay of 20ns. The signal frequency is 100MHz (period of 10ns ). The semi-rigid coax delay is set to the inherent oscilloscope delay of 20ns. A4-4.3 Measured RMS Signal Jitter, MS — For the MS measurement the observed edge occurs subsequent to the edge that triggered the oscilloscope: Figure A4-4 Measured RMS Signal Jitter, MS Copyright by SEMI® (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International), 3081 Zanker Road, San Jose, CA 95134."

A4-4.4 The observed edge depends upon the signal frequency; thus what is displayed is subsequent to the trigger pulse permitting signal jitter to be observed. A4-4.5 Measured RMS Instrumentation Jitter, MI — For the MI measurement the observed edge is the same edge that triggered the oscilloscope. Figure A4-5 Measured RMS Instrumentation Jitter, MI A4-4.6 There is no repetitive aspect of the signal, thus whatever jitter you observe is strictly instrumentation jitter. A4-4.7 Summary –– Jitter is only observable for a periodic signal or repetitive edge. Thus when MS measurements are made signal jitter is observed because a subsequent or repetitive signal is displayed (in addition to instrumentation jitter). When MI measurements are made the input signal is delayed such that you see the same edge that trigger the oscilloscope. That creates a non-repetitive or"

To prevent interference with overhead transport systems on the same or adjacent load port, it is recommended that floor-based transport vehicles do not exceed clearances C1 and C2 when picking up or placing the frame cassette on the load port. 7.8 Dimension S specifies the recommended minimum spacing between frame cassette centroids. In any case, if S violates C1, then C1 takes precedence. 7.9 To add clearance for overhead frame cassette transport, no part of the tool in front of the plane defined by C2 may be higher than H2 from the floor. The volume below H2 may contain the frame cassette stored in an internal buffer by the tool. 7.10 The load port must provide the option to use the conveyor rails for frame cassette loading.

A complete detailed procedure for the gas chromatographic assay is not given since available instruments vary from laboratory to laboratory. However, the use of wide bore capillary columns is recommended to replace conventional packed columns. Capillary columns, constructed of fused silica onto which is bonded a liquid phase, have greater resolving power and liquid chemical inertness. 7.2.1 Equipment — A"

On column injection can minimize sample degradation while increasing the reproducibility of results. On column injection is ideal to use with very volatile materials such as the reagents assayed in this guide. 7.2.3 Columns — Many types of columns exist and can be used. Until recently, packed columns in which a liquid phase is coated on a porous solid support were extensively used for assay of reagents. The introduction of wide bore capillary columns having an i.d. of typically 530 micrometers and a thick film of liquid phase from 1 to 5 micrometers allows a laboratory to use a packed column instrument and conditions, while gaining the advantages of capillary technology. Columns can be used either in the high resolution capillary mode"

Packed columns require a multitude of stationary phases to accomplish typical separations performed in an analytical laboratory. The increased length of capillary columns allows for better separation of components so that three columns of low (Type 1, Methyl Silicone), moderate (Type 2, Mixed Cyano, Phenyl, Methyl Silicone), and high (Type 3, Carbowax) polarity can handle the majority of analytical requirements. Columns, which have been found acceptable for assay of the reagents in this manual, are listed in Table 8.

Conditions, which have been found acceptable, are listed under each individual standard. When using packed column in the isothermal mode, the temperature of the column is usually maintained at $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ below the boiling point of the reagent. The efficient mass transfer associated with wide bore capillary columns may necessitate initial column temperatures to be more than $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ below the boiling point of the reagent of interest. Temperature programming may be used to improve the shape of eluting peaks and to shorten analysis times. The remaining two heated zones (injector and detector) should be maintained at as low a temperature as possible to lessen thermal decomposition effects."

The split or splitless mode of injection can be used depending on the chromatographic equipment available. The use of a wide bore capillary column simplifies conversion of a packed column to a capillary instrument. 7.2.5 Detector — Use of a thermal conductivity detector minimizes the need to correct for detector response to differences in liquid chemical composition and is usually sufficient for determining reagent assay. To qualify trace impurities, the more sensitive flame ionization detector is recommended. The detector output, after amplification, is used to produce the chromatogram, a plot of component quantity versus elution time. Modern systems digitize the analog output, allowing direct printout of peak areas and retention times. 7.2.6"

An internal standard reduces error due to variations in injection quantities, column, and detector conditions.

In the procedure given below, the positive error due to exposure to airborne particulate matter is reduced by the use of the closed system afforded by the Thiers assembly.

It provides for measurement of the absorbance of the sample and standards with subsequent calculation of the arsenic and antimony content of the sample, expressed as arsenic. The procedure given below differs from conventional ones by the omission of potassium iodide and stannous chloride. By this omission, antimony is evolved as stibine and reacts with the silver diethyldithiocarbamate solution. The color development is consequently due to both arsenic and antimony. The test sensitivity for arsenic is greater than for antimony. 7.6.2 Apparatus — The apparatus (see Figure 3) consists of a $1 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ arsine generator (a) fitted with a scrubber unit (c) and an absorber tube (e), with a 24/40 standard-taper joint (b) and a ground glass ball-and-socket joint (d), secured with a No. 12 clamp, connecting the units.
