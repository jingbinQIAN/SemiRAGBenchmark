The added manufacturing steps and complexity have increased cost of ICs directly impacting the implementation of IoT devices that need low cost and high yields to be successful. LEFT-ISD-LTSEE is a device that reduces the cost while improving device performance. LEFT-ISD-LTSEE is suit- able for sub 28 nm sizes where random threshold variation due to impact of discrete dopants in and around the channel is reduced by elimination of implants and drives. Also, by having a flat field profile at and around the gate, by use o: low temperature epitaxy as source/drain extension, the short channel effects, and the impact of line edge variations of the gate are reduced.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nOver the past decade or more scaling of the semiconduc- tor devices has been following Moore’s law. But the scaling is bumping against issues of high levels of doping and short channel effects that limit the capabilities of the devices. Device scaling has been instrumental in increasing the device density of integrated circuits ICs) and reducing the cost of these circuits. Today development of new device structures, use of new materials and implementation of complex process steps have to be implemented to continue scaling of the semiconductor devices. The number of steps and cost of each step of processing ICs have also increased with the complexity increase. These process and technology innovations come with associated cost of circuit implemen- tations. It will hence be optimum if a simpler device structure with simpler processing (with reduced number of steps) that is closer to the current processing flows in the fab, having improved short channel effects is available to continue the scaling of devices. A simplified device technology that can be implemente with a reduced number of masking and other process steps is proposed. The device structure reduces the effect of short channel effects on the operation of the devices developed and allow the devices to be scaled with minimum increase in device complexity. The processing is made much simpler by reduction or elimination of implant steps and associate: high temperature activation/drives but uses new available technology with lower temperature processing and selective epitaxial depositions. The replacement/elimination of criti- cal implant and activation steps reduce uncertainty of dopant location relative to the channel and help reduce the associ- ated variability of device characteristics. The reduction in short channel effects and reduction in variability of device characteristics enable the devices to move down the device scaling and integration path. The disclosed device and technology are usable for device processing on planar semi- conductor wafers, on Silicon on Insulator (SOD) and even for unique device structures like FinFET at and below the 28 nm device dimensions.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FIGURES\n\nFIG. 1—is an exemplary and non-limiting cross sectional view of a first embodiment of the invention.

Today development of new device structures, use of new materials and implementation of complex process steps are imple- mented to continue scaling of the semiconductor devices. FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 shows the completed structures of the low electrostatic field device (LEFT) 100 using implanted S/D and Selective Low Temperature Epitaxial Extension (SD-LTSEE) as per the two preferred embodiment of the invention. The structures are very similar, and the difference is in the structure and process of the Source/Drain and the extensions. The details are provided in the processing description explained with the detailed FIG. 1A to 1E and 2A to 2E. The LEFD using ISD-SEE is shown on a silicon substrate. A shallow trench isolation 102 is used to define and isolate the device from neighboring structures. A fixed. dopant concentration low dosed well 101 forms the active region of the REFD 100. A gate structure comprising a gate oxide 103 on silicon, with a conductive gate material 104 preferably amorphous silicon, having sidewall insulation dielectric 105 is used to control a channel region 103A under the gate oxide 103. A shallow S/D implant 108 implanted into the silicon provides the active Source and Drain regions 108 of the LEFT 100 device using ISD-LTSEE in silicon well 101. A thin epitaxial layer 106 A grown on silicon establish the Source and Drain extensions 106 and provide a vertical extension 108A of implanted Source and Drain regions 108 over the silicon surface. A spacer 107 is used to define the Source and Drain extensions 106 under the spacer. The Source drain and the gate contact areas 109 are silicided to establish good low resistance contacts to Source, Drain and Gate. 108A above the shallow implants, to the channel region 103A under the gate oxide 103 that is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate. FIG. 1A to FIG. 1E show process cross sections at various stages of processing of the first embodiment of the device and Table 1 shows an exemplary process flow comparison with the standard prior art process steps. Referring to FIG. 1A Referring to FIG. 1A At times the thin selective epitaxial region over the shallow S/D 108A will be completely consumed by the silicide formation. In such cases the shallow S/D region with overlap to the region that is silicided will prevent leakage current from the S/D 108A to the well 101. As shown in FIG. 1A, a shallow trench isolation 102 processes are done using standard device processing steps to isolate the device area on the substrate from neighboring devices. A well implant is done, (prefer a low doped substrate) if needed to produce a low and uniformly doped well 101. Grow sacrificial oxide, strip off and re-grow gate oxide 103. Deposit conductive gate material, mask and etch to define conductive gate layer 104 over the gate oxide 103. Grow or deposit a sidewall dielectric 105 on the sides and top of the conductive gate layer 104 to complete the gate structure of the device. Use of strained silicon channel can be implemented in the above-disclosed process by adding silicon germanium or other appropriate undoped epitaxial material growth in the S/D region using and extending the use of the strain material to grow the extensions. But having reduced short channel effects will allow the gate length to be reduced substantially without undue need for strain engineering and drain engi- neering to achieve the needed speeds. By using undoped or low-doped epitaxial silicon as part of the substrate it is possible to achieve very high mobility for the carriers (close to intrinsic mobility) with reduced drain engineering and channel strain engineering. Referring to FIG. 1B Referring to FIG. 3 showing Table 1. A spacer material, typically silicon nitride is deposited and an-isotropically etched to form a sacrificial spacer 107A. Implant a very shallow Source and Drain 108 into the semiconductor material using the sacrificial spacer 107A to keep the implants away from the gate structure and hence the channel under the gate oxide 103. FIG. 3—Table 1 provides a comparison of the steps required to implement P and N channel devices on a wafer. The common steps are grouped together in the table and a comparison of number of implants and masking steps required are provided. The comparison clearly shows the substantial reduction in critical process steps that are pos- sible with the disclosed device implementation. Referring to FIG. 1C The sacrificial spacer 107A is etched off completely and the gate oxide left on the semiconductor well 101, except the gate oxide under the gate structure is etched off and the surface is cleaned. A thin selective epitaxial layer of the correct in-situ doping 106A is grown using low temperature epitaxial growth on the surface over the well 101 on the exposed semiconductor on either side of the gate structure. Referring to FIG. 1D A new spacer is deposited which is larger in thickness than the previous spacer deposition. The post epitaxial implant and low temperature anneal/ activation of the source drain junctions will provide a very shallow drive of the epitaxial doping into the silicon sub- strate to allow better contact from the source drain epitaxial extensions to the channel. In addition, by providing a S/D extension which is on silicon surface almost in the plain of the channel, (there may be very slight diffusion into silicon substrate from the epi extension), the impact of source and drain on the channel that creates the short channel issues and the drain engineer- ing requirements are reduced. An-isotropic etching is done to create a spacer 107 on the sides of the gate structure over the selective epitaxial layer. Since the spacer thickness is larger it will be spaced hori- zontally further from the gate structure and the channel under the gate oxide 103 and have its edge inside the implanted S/D regions 108. The implanted S/D will extend up through the selective epitaxial material 108A. By providing non implanted Source/Drain extension using selective Epitaxial process and a uniformly doped well, the random variation of the doping ions on the thresh- old of the device due to random ions in or near the channel, namely the sigma Vt of the device is reduced substantially providing the device the capability to use lower supply voltages and scale to much smaller dimensions with very limited additional effort. The selective epitaxial material under the spacer will form the source and drain extension for connecting the Source and Drain areas 108A to the channel region in the well under the gate structure (gate oxide 103). Since the thin Selective Epitaxial layer is grown on the surface of silicon it is possible to increase the doping in the epitaxial layer to reduce the resistivity of the extension regions and reduce the effective series resistance of the source and drain of the device to improve the drive current capability of the device. The epi thickness, temperature and time of growth and doping concentrations have to be modelled to ensure that there is no doping diffusion into the silicon substrate. (in some instances, a low level of penetration may be beneficial) Referring to FIG. 1E A metal such as palladium, Ti, platinum is deposited and a slicidation 109 of the exposed S/D and gate are done completing the device. The Source and drain extensions 106 under the spacer 107 is used to connect the Source and drain regions that include the shallow implants 108 and the selective epitaxial region Referring to FIG. 5 showing Table 3. FIG. 5—Table 3 provides a comparison of implementa- tion of the disclosed device structure and process on SOI wafers as against the bulk semiconductor. As is clear the only difference in the process is reduction of the well masks. The SOI implementation provides all the advantages of the bulk implementation at a lower mask count. It also provides the capability for implementing back gate bias if required to reduce the leakages further. FIG. 2A to 2E show the show process cross sections at various stages of processing of the second embodiment of the device and FIG. 4 showing Table 2 shows an exemplary process flow comparison with the standard prior art process steps. Referring to FIG. 2A As shown in FIG. 2A, a shallow trench isolation 102 process is done using standard device processing steps to isolate the device area on the substrate from neighboring devices. A well implant is done if needed to produce a low and uniformly doped well 101. Grow sacrificial oxide, strip off and re-grow gate oxide 103. Deposit conductive gate material, mask and etch to define a conductive gate layer 104 over the gate oxide 103. without undue need for strain engineering and drain engi- neering to achieve the needed speeds. By using undoped or low-doped epitaxial silicon as part of the substrate it is possible to achieve very high mobility for the carriers (close to intrinsic mobility) with reduced drain engineering and channel strain engineering. Grow or deposit a sidewall dielectric 105 on the sides and top of the conductive gate layer 104 to complete the gate structure of the device. Referring to FIG. 2B The surface oxide is cleaned from the substrate and a thin selective epitaxial layer of the correct in-situ doping 206A is grown on the surface over the well 101 on the exposed semiconductor on either side of the gate structure. Referring to FIG. 2C A spacer material, typically silicon nitride is deposited and an-isotropically etched to form a sacrificial spacer 207A. Implant a very shallow Source and Drain 108 into the semiconductor material through the epitaxial layer 206A using the sacrificial spacer 207A to keep the implants away from the gate structure leaving a S/D extension 206 under the sacrificial spacer 207A, and hence keeping the implant away from the channel under the gate oxide 103. The thin epitaxial layer 208A outside the sacrificial spacer 107A is implanted through to form an implanted through epitaxial layer 208A to form the shallow S/D in the substrate implant. Referring to FIG. 2D New spacer material is deposited which covers the exist- ing spacer. An-isotropic etching is done to create a spacer 207 on the sides of the gate side wall oxide 105 that is larger than the original sacrificial spacer 207A, over the selective epitaxial layer forming the S/D extension 206 and the implanted through epitaxial layer 208 A. Since the spacer thickness is larger it will be spaced horizontally further from the gate structure and the channel under the gate oxide 103 and have its edge inside the implanted S/D regions 208A. The selective epitaxial material under the spacer will form the source and drain extension for connecting the Source and Drain areas 208A to the channel region in the well under the gate structure (below gate oxide 103). Since the Selective Epitaxial layer is grown on the surface of silicon it is possible to increase the doping in the epitaxial layer to reduce the resistivity of the extension regions and reduce the effective series resistance of the source and drain of the device to improve the drive current capability of the device. Referring to FIG. 2E A metal such as palladium, Ti, platinum is deposited and a slicidation 209 of the exposed S/D and gate are done completing the device. The Source and drain extensions 206 under the spacer 207 are used to connect the Source and drain regions that include the shallow implants 108 and implanted through selective epitaxial region 208A above the shallow implants, to the channel region 103A under the gate oxide 103 that is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate. At times the thin implanted through selective epitaxial region over the S/D 208A will be completely consumed by the silicide formation. In such cases the shallow S/D region with overlap to the region that is silicided will prevent leakage current from the S/D 208 to the well 101. Drain Engineering for Short Channel Effects and Strain. Use of strained silicon channel can be implemented in the above-disclosed process by adding silicon germanium or other appropriate undoped epitaxial material growth in the S/D region using and extending the use of the strain material to grow the extensions. But having reduced short channel effects will allow the gate length to be reduced substantially Referring to FIG. 4 showing Table 2. FIG. 4—Table 2 provides a comparison of the steps required to implement P and N channel devices on a wafer. The common steps are grouped together in the table and a comparison of number of implants and masking steps required are provided. The comparison clearly shows the substantial reduction in critical process steps that are pos- sible with the disclosed device implementation. The post epitaxial implant and low temperature anneal/ activation of the source drain junctions will provide a very shallow drive of the epitaxial doping into the silicon sub- strate to allow better contact from the source drain epitaxial extensions to the channel. In addition, by providing a S/D extension which is on silicon surface almost in the plain of the channel, with very shallow diffusion of dopant from the high doped extensions, the impact of source and drain on the channel that creates the short channel issues and the drain engineering requirements are reduced. By providing non implanted Source/Drain extension using selective Epitaxial process and a uniformly doped well, the random variation of the doping ions on the thresh- old of the device due to random ions in or near the channel, namely the sigma Vt of the device is reduced substantially providing the device the capability to use lower supply voltages and scale to much smaller dimensions with very limited additional effort. Referring to FIG. 6—Table 4. FIG. 6—Table 4 provides a comparison of implementa- tion of the disclosed device structure and process on SOI wafers as against the bulk semiconductor. As is clear the only difference in the process is reduction of the well masks. The SOI implementation provides all the advantages of the bulk implementation at a lower mask count. It also provides the capability for implementing back gate bias if required to reduce the leakages further. Some advantages of the current disclosed inventions described include: . Very low electrostatic field at source and drain junc- tions, allowing very small planar devices to be imple- mented and scaling to be continued. 2. Reduced variation of threshold (sigma Vt) over the designed value due to impact of discrete dopants in and around the channel. 3.

Use of a sacrificial spacer (similar to spacer last) technology in one implementation with selective epi- taxial growth for gate length control and low series resistance. 6. Use of low temperature processing to limit diffusion of dopants and associated gate length variations. 7. Very low diffusion from doped Epi to ensure S/D to channel connectivity under all conditions. 8. Elimination of implants and high temperature steps for establishing critical dimensions and device character- istics reduce the process related variations of threshold (sigma Vt) due to random dopant near and in the channel. 9. Reduced number of critical masking steps. 10. Overall reduction in complexity of process with associated cost reduction. 11. Implementable on planar silicon, and SOI substrates. 12. Can be implemented using silicon or metal gate technologies. laying the shallow implanted drain, the epitaxial drain extension in contact with the substrate, the epitaxial drain extension on the surface of the substrate abuts the gate structure but is insulated from the conductive gate electrode by the protective dielectric on the side walls of the conductive gate electrode; 13.
