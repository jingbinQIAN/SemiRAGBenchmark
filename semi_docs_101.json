It is often necessary to perform hazard analyses to identify hazards that are specific to the system, and develop hazard control measures that adequately control the associated risk beyond those that are covered in existing design-based standards. This document provides guidelines for developing a deliberate, planned equipment/product safety (EPS) program integrating the compliance assessment activities with hazard analyses and other activities needed to provide a safe system throughout the life of equipment or products. R1-1.2 An effective EPS program reduces the cost, schedule slips, and liability associated with the late identification and correction of hazards. To be most effective, an EPS program should be begun by the manufacturer early during the design phase. Starting early allows safety to be designed into the system and its subsystems, equipment,"

The equipment must be below this limit to be sold in some parts of the world. R7-3.8 $X$ -rays — are produced with electricity and therefore can be turned off. X-rays seem to be the most prevalent radiation type in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. They are produced when charged particles are slowed or stopped. This slowing results in “bremsstrahlung.” The majority of the equipment does not intentionally produce X-rays. This energy is a by-product of the process."

    "content": "R7-4.1  Gamma radiation is a by-product of atomic transformations (decay) and is a release of energy from the nucleus. This radiation energy must be shielded since there is no off switch.  \nR7-4.2  Radioactive Materials are controlled by licensing. There are quantities of certain radioactive materials that are exempt from regulation. These sources should be identified.  \nR7-4.3  External radiation hazards from radioactive materials include gamma rays. These are controlled and evaluated much like the X-rays.  \nR7-4.4  Internal radiation hazards from radioactive materials include Alpha and Beta particles. Radioactive materials ingested or inhaled can be metabolized or damage surrounding tissue. Allowable levels of airborne radioactivity and radionuclide intakes are specified in regulations. The objective is still to maintain all exposure to ionizing radiation (internal and external) as low as reasonably achievable, but always less than the allowable regulatory limits."

According to C95.1 “controlled access” environments are those where “locations where there is exposure that may be incurred by persons who are aware of the potential for exposure as a concomitant of employment, by other cognizant persons, or as the incidental result of transient passage through areas where analysis shows the exposure levels may be above those shown in Table 2 but do not exceed those of Table 1, and where the induced currents may exceed the values in Table 2, Part B, but do not exceed the values of Table"

The exposure may occur in living quarters or workplaces where there are no expectations that the exposure levels may exceed those shown in Table 2 and where induced currents do not exceed those in Table 2, Part B.” Task force members advise that C95.1 “controlled access” and other “occupational exposure” standards should be applied to personnel performing maintenance and service of equipment and that “uncontrolled access” or other “general public” standards should be applied to equipment operators during routine work and to other locations. These IEEE definitions are particularly relevant to broadcast facilities as well as normal industrial environments such as fabs. Task force members recommend that uncontrolled access"
