A1-4.4 Use test instrument software to establish the coordinates of the center of all cells as determined from the ratio $R _ { o } / N _ { C }$ , calculated in Section A1-4.3. Disallow measurement sites near the wafer perimeter such that the radial distance to the center of the cell, that is, the center of the measurement spot, is larger than $R _ { o }$ . This follows the same rationale for allowed measurement sites as is used with the concentric circle plans. A1-4.5 Take measurements at all sites allowed in accordance with Table A1-2. The measurement sequence, whether starting from the center point and moving outward or starting from one edge a row or column at a time, is to be decided by the parties to the test.

It is shown schematically in Figure A1-4 for the diameter being parallel to a major wafer flat.  However, in the case of notched wafers, the notch would replace the flat in the figure.  It is also possible, by agreement of the parties to the test, to make the measurements along a diameter at a specified angle with respect to the fiducial axis as long as such an angle is then stated in the report.  \nA1-5.2 Choose a value, $N _ { M }$ , for the number of measurements, where $N _ { M }$ is at least 25.  The separation between measurement sites is given by $2 R _ { o } / ( N _ { M } - 1 )$ , where $R _ { o }$ is determined as in Section A1-1.1.  \nFigure A1-4  \nNOTE:  The radius $R _ { o }$ is given by Equation A1-1 for Method A and by Equation A1-2 for Method B.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # Illustration of Single-Diameter, High-Density Measurement Site Plan (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # Illustration of Single-Diameter, High-Density Measurement Site Plan\n\nContent: A1-5.2.2 Compare the site separation, $2 R _ { o } / ( N _ { M } \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 )$ , with the estimated measurement sampling area or spot size. If the interval is smaller than this value, little additional information may be obtained by choosing so large a value for $N _ { M }$ ; it may be appropriate to reduce $N _ { M }$ so that the new calculated site separation is equal to or greater than the measurement sampling area. A1-5.3 Establish the coordinates for all measurement sites using the site interval value just calculated and the wafer center as the reference point. Take measurements at all sites. A1-5.4 Calculate the uniformity based on the difference between the maximum and minimum measured values, $H L V ( \\% )$ , and on the standard deviation as a percent of the mean of all measurements, $S U P ( \\% )$ , as detailed in Section 9.3.

Current edition approved for publication by the North American Regional Standards Committee on March 14, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org May 2004; to be published July 2004.  Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1630- 95.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1630-00.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1 Electronic grade polysilicon producers and users rely on LTFT-IR spectroscopy to evaluate polysilicon for quality assurance and research purposes.  \n1.2 LTFT-IR spectroscopy identifies and quantitates boron, phosphorus, aluminum, arsenic, indium, antimony, and gallium.  \n1.3 LTFT-IR spectroscopy can be applied to FZ, CZ, or other single crystal silicon (either doped or undoped) up to the concentration limits given in Section 2.2.  \n1.4 The measurement of carbon in silicon at low temperature can be accomplished concurrently in accordance with SEMI MF1391.  The carbon can be measured at lower concentrations at $< 1 5 ~ \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ than is possible at room temperature because the two-phonon band transmission is increased by a factor of two allowing greater throughput to the detector that results in an increased signal to noise ratio.  Also the carbon adsorption band narrows from a FWHM of 5 to $6 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ to a FWHM of 2.5 to $3 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at these low temperatures.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1 This test method covers the determination of electrically active boron, phosphorus, arsenic, aluminum, antimony, and gallium concentration in single crystal silicon.  \n2.2 This test method can be used for silicon in which the impurity/dopant concentrations are between 0.01 ppba and 5.0 ppba for each of the electrically active elements.  \n2.3 The concentration for each impurity/dopant can be obtained by application of Beer’s Law.  Calibration factors are given for each element.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 The sample specimen must be colder than $1 5 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ for measurement of electrically active species. If the sample specimen is mounted on a cold finger, care must be taken to obtain good contact between the sample specimen and the cold finger for efficient heat transfer. The oxygen absorption lines at $1 1 3 6 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and 1128 $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ are sensitive to temperature and can be used to determine the specimen temperature.1 When the sample specimen is less than $1 5 \\mathrm { K }$ the net absorbance at $1 1 3 6 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ is three times larger than the net absorbance at $1 1 2 8 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ . A ratio of greater than three is obtained for temperatures below $1 5 \\mathrm { K }$ . 3.2 Without sufficient incident white light the compensated donors and acceptors will not absorb. Therefore, the white light intensity must be great enough to completely neutralize all the compensated donors and acceptors.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: The intensity of the white light necessary must be determined for each system. The user should increase the intensity of the white light until further increase in intensity no longer affects the area/height of the electrically active impurity/dopant peaks. $3 . 3 \\mathrm { W }$ ater vapor absorption interferes with the measurement of several peaks. Consequently, the background spectrum should be collected at least daily. The entire light path, including the sample chamber, must be purged to remove moisture. Special care should be taken whenever a sample specimen is changed so that the moisture level in the sample chamber or elsewhere in the light path is not affected. 3.4 Oxygen level in Czochralski silicon can be high enough to exhibit thermal donor absorption lines. These lines fall between $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ and $5 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and can interfere with aluminum $( 4 7 3 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ ), gallium (548 $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 3  Limitations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: \\mathrm { \\AA }$ ), and occasionally arsenic $( 3 8 2 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ . Thermal donors can be removed by annealing the sample specimen. 3.5 Multiple internal reflections can produce a secondary interferogram and baseline oscillations. Changing the sample specimen thickness, the surface preparation, or the resolution can eliminate the secondary interferogram and the baseline oscillation. 3.6 High antimony levels interfere with the $3 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ boron absorption line. Antimony' s strongest absorption line is $2 9 3 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ , but a secondary absorption line occurs at 320 cm−1.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 4.1 SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI MF723 — Practice for Conversion Between Resistivity and Dopant Density for Boron-Doped, Phosphorus-Doped, and Arsenic-Doped Silicon  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Semiconductor Technology  \nSEMI MF1391 — Test Method for Substitutional Atomic Carbon Content of Silicon by Infrared Absorption  \nSEMI MF1723 Practice for Evaluation of Polycrystalline Silicon Rods by Float-Zone Crystal Growth and Spectroscopy\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 4.2 ASTM Standards\n\nE 131 Terminology Relating to Molecular Spectroscopy2  \nE 168 Practices for General Techniques of Infrared Quantitative Analysis2  \nE 177 — Practices for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods3  \nE 275 — Practice for Describing and Measuring the Performance of Ultraviolet, Visible, and Near-Infrared Spectrophotometers  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1 General definitions for terms related to infrared absorption spectroscopy are found in ASTM Terminology E 131.  \n5.2 Definitions for terms related to silicon materials technology are found in SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 5.3 Abbreviations and Acronyms\n\n5.3.1 FT-IR Fourier transform infrared (spectrometer).  \n5.3.2 FWHM — full width of an absorption peak expressed in $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at half its absorbance magnitude as measured from the baseline.  \n5.3.3 LTFT-IR — low temperature, Fourier transform infrared (spectrometer).\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 5.4 Definitions\n\n5.4.1 background spectrum, $n$ — in FT-IR instruments, the single-beam spectrum obtained without a specimen in the infrared light path that is usually obtained with only nitrogen, dry air, or a vacuum in the beam.  \n5.4.2 baseline, n — a straight line interpolation between points on either side of the absorption peak of the absorbance spectrum.  \n5.4.3 electrically active elements, $n$ — dopants or impurities in silicon that are members of either Group III (boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium) or Group V (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) of the periodic table.  \n5.4.4 sample spectrum, n — the ratio of a spectrum obtained with the test specimen in the IR beam to a background spectrum.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 6  Summary of Test Method (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: $6 . 1 \\mathrm { A }$ sample specimen of single crystal silicon is cooled to less than $1 5 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ . Under these conditions the number of free carriers becomes negligibly small and the IR spectrum of the sample exhibits a series of absorption bands that are characteristic for each shallow impurity species. 6.2 The sample specimen is illuminated with an incident white light source to flood the silicon with photons of greater energy than the silicon band gap to allow neutralization of compensated impurities.5 $6 . 3 \\mathrm { A n }$ infrared beam is directed through the sample specimen and a transmitted spectrum is collected.

This cryostat may be liquid helium immersion, exchange gas, or closed cycle refrigeration. 7.2 Sample Specimen Holder — Constructed of high heat conductivity metal with an aperture(s) to block any of the infrared beam except that passing through the sample. NOTE 1: The procedure of Section 11 is based on the assumption that the cryostat can accommodate and utilizes a multi-sample holder. 7.3 White-light Source — As shown in Figure 1. 7.4 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) — Must be equipped with suitable optics and detector for use in the region from $2 5 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ to $1 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ . 7.4.1 The spectrometer shall be capable of at least 1.0 $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ resolution.

A room temperature DTGS with a CsI window suffices for the higher concentrations of elements in this test method. However, a zinc-doped germanium $\\mathrm { G e : Z n }$ detector operated at 4.4 to $1 0 . 0 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ is preferred to give a signalto-noise ratio sufficient to properly determine the elements at the lower concentrations and for improved precision. 7.5 Calcium Fluoride Crystal $( C a F _ { 2 } )$ — Cut to nominal thickness of $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ .\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 8  Sample Preparation\n\n8.1 If the samples are from polysilicon, they must first be converted to single crystal in accordance with SEMI MF1723 or other established means.  \n8.2 Sample specimen shall be cut and polished to fit the sample specimen holder. The surface may be mechanically or chemically polished.  Each sample specimen shall have a thickness variation of less than $1 \\%$ of overall thickness.  \n8.3 For measurement of electrically active impurities, the sample specimen thickness should be as follows:  \n8.3.1 For high purity silicon $( > 2 0 0 0 ~ \\Omega { \\cdot } \\mathrm { c m } )$ : 3 to $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ to allow for lower detection limits.  \n8.3.2 Between 5 and $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ in cases where impurity levels to be measured are below 0.01 ppba.  \n8.3.3 For heavily doped silicon $( < 1 0 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m } )$ : 1 to $2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ to allow greater transmission of the infrared radiation.\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 9  Reference Specimens\n\n9.1 One or more silicon samples that contain impurities in the range of the samples to be tested shall be classified as reference specimens.

The absorption bands are very sharp, especially for the Group V elements, and therefore peak height measurements are difficult to reproduce from instrument to instrument. Use of peak areas greatly reduces this variability. 12.1.1 Establish baselines for each peak before measurement of the area. Use only the area above the established baseline in the calculations. Several algorithms are available on various commercial FT-IR instruments to obtain the desired baseline corrected areas. The following is one suggested method: 12.1.1.1 Retrieve the sample absorbance spectrum from the computer storage disk. With the wavenumber expand commands available, zoom in on the region of the absorption band(s) of interest. Expand until this region is only slightly larger than the baseline limit regions given in Table 1. 12.1.1.2 Employ the interactive baseline\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 12  Data Reduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 12  Data Reduction\n\nContent: correction routine to bring the spectral baseline to coincide with the 0.0 absorbance line. Refer to Table 1 for the upper and lower wavenumber regions for guidance in adjusting the baseline. Expand in the absorbance scale as necessary to improve the observation of the noise and fine features of the spectrum in order to provide the best placement of the baseline. Apply only linear corrections with the fit of the straight line through the points on both sides of the absorption peak(s). Note that the peaks for boron and phosphorus are very close together and thus only one baseline is obtained surrounding both peaks. Figures 2 and 3 show spectra before and after, respectively, baseline correction for boron and phosphorus spectral region. 12.1.2 Measure the area for the absorption peak between the upper and lower wavenumbers given in Table 1 for the integration limits. Most computer algorithms handle this nicely. However, disable the automatic zeroing of the baseline at the integration\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 12  Data Reduction (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # 12  Data Reduction\n\nContent: limits. If not disabled, the integration would not represent the baseline as established in Section 12.1.1 and may result in errors. 12.1.3 Repeat Sections 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 for each component desired for each specimen measured. Table 1 Peak Location, Baseline and Integration Limits, and Calibration Factors A The factors given here do not all have the same degree of certainty.

It was developed as non-mandatory information in ASTM during the initial development of the document in 1994-5. This related information was approved for publication by SEMI by full letter ballot procedures on March 14, 2004. R1-1 The factors shown in Table 1 resulted from several years of corrections and modifications but are ultimately based on resistivity measurements on silicon samples. The dopant density, or the concentration of impurities for this test method, is directly obtained from the conversion Tables found in SEMI MF723. R1-2 Baber’s5 calibration factors published in 1980, were the starting point for the current factors. Corrections or modifications, or both, to his published data follow in this discussion. R1-2.1 Baber’s LTFT-IR study utilized the conversion relations reported by Irvin7 in 1962, relating\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON\n\nContent: resistivity and impurity concentrations. Currently, the conversion tables given in SEMI MF723 are believed to be more reliable. Corrections to Baber’s factors were made to reflect these new conversion tables. R1-2.2 The factors of Baber relate peak heights of the absorption bands to concentrations. Peak heights are extremely sensitive to several FT-IR parameters. The phosphorus band at $3 1 6 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and the arsenic band at $3 8 2 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ are very narrow, about $0 . 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ , and thus the peak heights of these bands vary greatly with nominal resolution, type of apodization, degree of zerofilling, and mechanical strain on the sample. The boron absorption at $3 1 9 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ band used in this test method is actually a composite of four separate boron absorption bands. The variability of the\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON\n\nContent: measurement of the absorption bands is reduced considerably when peak areas are used instead of peak heights. The use of peak areas is common in the field and their use is specified in this test method. R1-2.3 Further minor modifications have been made over the in the period from about 1985 to about 1995 in several laboratories that use LTFT-IR spectrometers for determination of electrically active impurities. R1-2.3.1 Studies with and without the white light on the silicon samples, covering a wide range of concentrations, are valuable as tools to check for consistency of the boron and phosphorus factors, which are indeed the most common impurities. With the absence of white light, the LTFT-IR method shows only the net carrier absorption bands at an intensity proportional to the excess majority carrier concentration. These data along with the total impurities obtained with white light on the\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON\n\nContent: samples permitted minor adjustments to the boron or phosphorus factors, or both. R1-2.3.2 Silicon samples whose resistivity has been carefully determined have been measured by LTFT-IR spectroscopy, and the results used to confirm or slightly modify the calibration factors. R1-3 In 1990, a pilot study was conducted in which ten silicon samples were examined at four different laboratories by either LTFT-IR or photoluminescence, or both, and the results compared. Even though each laboratory used their own factors and modifications of this test method for determination of impurity concentrations, the data for boron and phosphorus all agreed to within $\\pm \\nobreakspace 2 0 \\%$ of the average value. The factors given in this test method are approximately equal to the average values from that study. R1-4 In summary, the factors given in Table 1 are a result of continued refinement as more and\n\nSEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1630-0704TEST METHOD FOR LOW TEMPERATURE FT-IR ANALYSIS OFSINGLE CRYSTAL SILICON FOR III-V IMPURITIES - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 DERIVATION OF FACTORS USED IN CALCULATING CONCENTRATIONS AND DENSITIES OF ELEMENTS IN SILICON\n\nContent: better measurements have been made. However, they ultimately correspond to the resistivity measurements and the conversion to dopant (impurity) concentrations as given in SEMI MF723. The factors for boron and phosphorus have the highest degree of certainty since these two elements are the most commonly measured and are therefore studied the most. The factors for the other elements, especially aluminum, antimony, gallium, and indium, should be considered only approximations and used only to estimate their concentrations in silicon.

This practice provides a means to determine the impurity levels in granular polysilicon to be used for crystal growth.  \n1.3 Carbon levels in polysilicon must be known so that the concentration of carbon in the ingot can be controlled to a low level.  \n1.4 This practice has applicability in production control, quality assurance, materials research, and materials acceptance.\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This practice describes a procedure to consolidate granular polysilicon into a solid rod and then to convert the polysilicon rod into a single crystal by a float-zone technique. The resultant single crystal ingot is used for the determination of trace impurities in the polysilicon. These impurities are acceptor and donor components (usually boron, aluminum, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony) as well as substitutional carbon. 2.2 The useful range of impurity concentration covered by this practice is 0.002 to 100 parts per billion atomic (ppba) for acceptor and donor impurities, and 0.02 to 15 parts per million atomic (ppma) for carbon. The acceptor and donor impurities in a slice taken from the single crystal ingot are analyzed by photoluminescence or infrared spectroscopies. The carbon impurity is determined by analysis of a slice by infrared spectroscopy. 2.3 This practice is applicable only to evaluation of polysilicon granules as produced by thermal decomposition and deposition of silane, or one of the\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: chlorosilanes, onto high purity seeds of polysilicon in a continuous or batch fluid bed reactor.

Anyone using these acids must be familiar with and use precautionary means to avoid injury. 12.1.2 Etch, clean and dry other quartz parts, including sample containers and funnels as in Section 12.1.1 except that the etchant used is $1 { : } 1 \\ \\mathrm { H F } { : } \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ . 12.1.3 Carefully clean the carriage endpieces, stainless steel rods, and chucks of the melter/zoner by rinsing with methanol and allowing them to thoroughly dry in\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 12  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 12  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: the clean room environment. 12.2 Prepare the silicon pedestals and single crystal seed rods for use by etching with a continuous stream of the MAE for 15 to $2 0 \\mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ , followed quickly with a copious rinse of DI water. Air dry or blot dry with lintfree paper.\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: 13.1 Assemble a freshly etched and dried quartz tube into the carriage endpieces. NOTE 2: Freshly, as referred to here and the following paragraphs, refers to a time of less than $^ { \\textrm { 1 h } }$ . 13.2 Mount a freshly etched and dried silicon pedestal (6 by 6 by $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } )$ ) in the upper chuck and place in the upper endpiece. Center the silicon pedestal within the quartz tube. Adjust the carriage so that the bottom of the silicon pedestal is inside but not below the working rf coil. Remove the pedestal and chuck and set aside for later use. 13.3 Mount a freshly cleaned PTFE plunger-diffuser part on the lower rod assembly and place it inside the bottom of the quartz tube. Secure the rod assembly to the lower endpiece and carefully move the rod and plunger to a point of about 100 to $1 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ below the rf coil. Start the argon purge and diffuser gas flow at a rate of about 0.1 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) through the lower portal, PTFE diffuser, and exhaust\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: out the top of the open quartz tube through the upper endpiece. 13.4 Introduce the granular polysilicon sample through the upper end piece with a quartz funnel. Fill with about $2 5 \\mathrm { g }$ of polysilicon until the upper bed of granules is near the lower part of the rf coil. Reduce the argon flow until only the top layer of granules are fluidized. 13.5 Remove the funnel and replace the upper chuck and silicon pedestal. Reposition the carriage so that the pedestal is midway between the rf coil. 13.6 Ignite the hydrogen-air torch and position it slightly above and about $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the working coil impacting the outside of the quartz tube. Turn on and increase the rf power to about $80 \\%$ of the operating power needed for melting. Watch for rf coupling with the silicon rod, which will occur in about $2 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ as is evident from the red glow of the pedestal. Turn off the torch and move the carriage upward at a rate that the red hot zone follows the rf coil until the\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: hot zone is at the bottom of the silicon pedestal. 13.7 Increase the rf power until the bottom of the pedestal melts. Move the position of the granules upward with the lower rod and PTFE plunger until the top of the fluidized bed begins to melt into the upper pedestal. As the granules melt into the upper pedestal, move the entire carriage upward. NOTE 3: The melt freezes as it leaves the working zone of the rf coil. The consolidated rod diameter is smaller than the inside diameter of the quartz tube so it does not contact the tube walls. 13.8 Continue consolidation growth with minor adjustments until a consolidated polysilicon rod of about $9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ in diameter and $6 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ in length is obtained. Lower the polysilicon granules bed and reduce the rf power permitting the tail end of the rod to solidify. Note the time required for the melting process (normally about $1 2 \\mathrm { m i n }$ ). 13.9 Remove the lower rod and plunger from the quartz tube by removal of part of the\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: lower endpiece. Let the excess polysilicon granules fall out the bottom of the tube and discard them. 13.10 Remove the PTFE plunger/diffuser from the lower stainless steel rod and replace it with the lower seed chuck (see Figure 1). 13.11 Mount a freshly etched and dried single crystal silicon seed (2.5 by 2.5 by $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } ,$ ) in the lower chuck. Place the silicon seed rod, chuck, and lower rod into the quartz tube through the bottom as before. Move the lower rod upward until the seed crystal is about $5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ below the tip of the consolidated polysilicon rod previously produced. Purge the entire tube for a minimum of $1 \\mathrm { m i n }$ at a flow rate of 0.5 SCFM. 13.12 Reduce the argon purge to about 0.1 SCFM. Reignite the hydrogen torch and increase the rf power to $80 \\%$ needed to melt silicon. Watch for the glow of the consolidated polysilicon rod as rf coupling begins. Shut off the torch. 13.13 Increase rf power until the consolidated polysilicon rod tip is molten and\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: then raise the seed to penetrate into the melt. Hold in this position until the seed has taken sufficient heat to melt and becomes one with the melt from the consolidated polysilicon rod. 13.14 In a trial and error mode, increase the rf power as needed to carry out the one pass zone leveling. When the proper rf power is established, activate the motorized carriage for movement downward (floating zone movement is upward) at a rate to match that employed during the consolidation process, typically a zone rate of about $5 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ per minute. Continue the zoning until the entire consolidated polysilicon rod has been converted to a single crystal as is evident by the four growth facet lines. Now, slightly reduce the rf power and slowly move the lower rod downward separating the single crystal ingot from the polysilicon rod. Turn off the rf power. Allow about $2 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ for the ingot to cool. 13.15 Remove the single crystal ingot and break off the seed crystal after scoring with a\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: diamond scribe. Save the remaining seed for growth of the next crystal. Examine the crystal to be sure the growth facet lines extend the entire length of the ingot. 13.16 Mount the crystal in the saw chuck and cut an analytical slice 2 to $4 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ thick as needed from the center one-third of the crystal. NOTE 4: Since segregation of the impurities occurs both during the consolidation step and the conversion to single crystal, the one pass zone during the conversion to single crystal at the same rate as the consolidation step effectively levels these impurities. Thus, the concentration of the impurities in the ingot is essentially constant except at both extremes. 13.17 Prepare the analytical slice for infrared or photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements with application of a bright chemical etch or a mechanical polish. 13.17.1 To etch, hold the slice with polyethylene forceps and suspend it into a PTFE beaker filled with the mixed acid etchant as described in Section 8.5. Gently stir the\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: solution with a magnetic stir bar while immersing the silicon slice for $4 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ . Remove and quickly rinse with copious amounts of DI water. Air dry the silicon slice, which is now ready for analysis. 13.18 Utilize the appropriate test methods for the desired analysis. For carbon content, test by infrared spectrophotometry in accordance with SEMI MF1391. For determination of donor and acceptor contents, test either by low-temperature FT-IR analysis in accordance with SEMI MF1630 or by photoluminescence analysis in accordance with SEMI MF1389, or both.\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 14  Interpretation of Results\n\n14.1 The results obtained from spectroscopic techniques on the analytical slice as obtained, directly represent the impurity concentrations in the granular polysilicon provided no impurity contamination is found during the process.  In reality, there is always small impurity contamination during the consolidation and conversion to a single crystal.  This contamination leads to results higher than actually present in the granular polysilicon.\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 15  Precision\n\n15.1 In the mid-nineties, the precision of this practice was established by one laboratory as follows: A large sample of granular polysilicon was evaluated repeatedly and periodically by this practice for over more than a year.  Low temperature Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to measure the impurity concentrations.  The combined errors of sample handling, consolidation to polysilicon rod, conversion to a single crystal ingot, and the infrared determinations gave a standard deviation of 0.03 ppba at the 0.06 ppba concentration level for boron and phosphorus and a standard deviation of 0.03 ppma for interstitial carbon at the 0.07 ppma level.  \n15.2 Analysis of more recent similar data indicates that the standard deviation is less than 0.02 ppba at the 0.04 ppba concentration level for boron and phosphorus and 0.02 ppma for interstitial carbon at the 0.05 ppma level.\n\nSEMI MF1708-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF GRANULAR POLYSILICON BY MELTER-ZONER SPECTROSCOPIES - # 16  Keywords\n\n16.1 granular polysilicon; polycrystalline silicon; polysilicon consolidation; polysilicon evaluation; polysilicon impurities  \nNOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any particular application.

The resultant single crystal ingots are analyzed by spectrophotometric methods to determine the trace impurities in the polysilicon. These trace impurities are acceptor (usually boron or aluminum, or both), donor (usually phosphorus or arsenic, or both), and carbon impurities. 2.2 The useful range of impurity concentration covered by this practice is 0.002 to 100 parts per billion atomic (ppba) for acceptor and donor impurities, and 0.02 to 15 parts per million atomic (ppma) for carbon impurity. These impurities are analyzed in the ingot samples by infrared or photoluminescence spectroscopy. 2.3 This practice is applicable only to evaluation of polysilicon ingots grown by a method that utilizes a slim silicon rod (filament) upon which the polycrystalline silicon is deposited.

It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Polysilicon rods that are cracked, highly stressed, or have deep dendritic growth cannot be sampled due to shattering or breaking during the coring process. 3.2 Polysilicon cores with fractures, cracked surfaces, or voids in the surface are difficult to clean. Impurities are not completely etched out of the cracks or voids, or etch residues may remain in the cracks, thus contributing contamination. Cracked or highly stressed cores may shatter or break during the zoning process. Cores must be cleaned after fabrication to remove any oil, grease, or handling contamination. 3.3 The purity of the acids and deionized water (DI) is critically important. Impurities in the acids, etching apparatus, or water may interfere with accurate, reproducible analysis. Etching and zoning should be done in a clean room to minimize impurities from the ambient air, walls, floors, and furniture. The specific acid mixture, acid etch temperature, silicon removal rate, number of etch-rinse cycles, and\n\nSEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: exposure time are other factors that must be monitored and controlled to prevent impurity interferences. Any materials that contact the etched cores, such as boats and containers, must be cleaned before use and monitored to prevent contamination. Gloves or other materials used to wrap the etched cores must be tested and monitored to prevent contamination. 3.4 The zoner itself, especially the preheater, can introduce impurities into the growing silicon ingot. The walls, preheater, coil, and seals of the zoner are usual sources of contamination. Maintaining a clean zoner is very important to the procedures covered by this practice. 3.5 Any variation from the prescribed float-zoning procedures that can affect the distribution of the volatile impurities in the gas, liquid, and solid phases will alter the results. Variations in core diameter, zone dimensions, pull rate, seal purity, or ambient conditions may alter the effective distribution coefficient or evaporation rate and thus\n\nSEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: change the amount of impurity incorporated into the crystal. 3.6 Each acceptor or donor element and carbon have unique segregation coefficients. By growing several ingots with lengths up to 30 times the zone length, the effective segregation coefficient can be measured. These should agree with published values.1,2 Wafers are cut from this ingot at equilibrium positions corresponding to the segregation coefficient. Wafers cut from other locations may not accurately represent the amount of impurity in the polysilicon. If ingots can not be grown to sufficient length to achieve the flat portion of the axial concentration profile, wafers can be cut from the ingot, and the measured values corrected for the effective segregation coefficient, based on repeated measurements of control rods. $3 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { { I n } }$ the conversion of the core to a monocrystal during zoning, it is possible to lose structure and have a zoned rod that is not monocrystalline.

Cores can be taken parallel or perpendicular to the filament at both ends of the rod. The preparation and zoning process is the same for both types, but the data calculation and carbon analysis are different. 6.2 After inspection for damage, the polysilicon cores are identified and scheduled for etching and crystal growth. Cores are etched in acid, rinsed clean, mounted into a float-zone crystal growth apparatus, and converted to single crystal ingots. Cores must be floatzoned as soon as possible after being etched to avoid surface contamination. Studies in one laboratory in an ISO Class 5 (Note 1) clean room indicated that surface contamination can occur after 36 h. For each laboratory, maximum holding times and handlingpackaging procedures must be determined. Cores must be reetched if the maximum holding period is exceeded.

The cores are intended to be representative of the polysilicon rod being sampled. 10.2 A number of cores can be taken at different locations of the polysilicon rod to satisfy various sample plans. Samples taken should cover both ends of the rod. Two typical sampling methods are taking cores parallel to the filament and taking cores perpendicular to the filament as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The parallel core system is described in Section 10.2.1. The perpendicular core system is described in Section 10.2.2. 10.2.1 Parallel Cores — As shown in Figure 1, cores are taken parallel to the filament at a minimum length of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ and a diameter of $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ .

To find the impurities in the total rod, the filament must be analyzed separately and combined with the growth layer results. Values are calculated using the formulas for parallel cores. 10.2.2.2 Perpendicular Core Sampling Location For an entire U-rod of polysilicon, cores usually are taken from the short bridging section, or from a region on the long rod within $5 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ of either end.

For higher solidification rates, the impurity atoms are rejected by the advancing melt at a greater rate than they can diffuse into the melt.

The concentration of this gradient depends on the growth rate, fluid flow in the melt, and diffusion behavior of the dopant.

The doping profile, measured for each impurity, determines where the ingot should be cut to provide accurate impurity values. Sample points should be chosen to be representative of more than $90 \\%$ of the impurity concentration. In Figure 3, the zone length is measured at $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . If the doping profile indicates that the flat portion of the curve is at 12-zone lengths for an impurity, take the sample at 12-zone lengths $1 2 \\times 1 5$ $\\mathrm { m m } = 1 8 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ ) from the start of solidification on the ingot. 12.6.2.4 Ingot Profiling— For the type of float zone furnace, coil design, pull rates, and ingot/core sample diameter used, the effective segregation coefficient for the impurities can vary. To calibrate the individual zoner parameters and technique used, measure the actual segregation coefficient profile. For example, to determine the carbon profile, cut an ingot into wafers along its\n\nSEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.6  Ingot Sampling (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.6  Ingot Sampling\n\nContent: length, and measure the carbon content in each of the wafers. Then make a plot of carbon concentration as a function of zone length. The number of zone lengths required to reach the flat portion of the axial concentration profile determines the length of ingot that must be grown to achieve an accurate carbon value. Figure 4 shows an axial doping profile for carbon where a $2 0 \\mathrm { - m m }$ diameter sample core was zoned to a $1 0 \\mathrm { - m m }$ diameter ingot with a zone length of 15 mm. The effective segregation coefficient was 0.175. In this case, growing the ingot to a zone length of 12 ensures that the maximum amount of carbon has been incorporated into the ingot. Sampling the ingot for carbon at a zone length of 12 gives reproducible carbon values that accurately reflect the amount of carbon in the polysilicon sample. 12.6.2.5 Slice Locations — Once the concentration gradient for each element for the individual zoner conditions is established, establish\n\nSEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.6  Ingot Sampling (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.6  Ingot Sampling\n\nContent: sampling rules for each element. Boron, with a high segregation coefficient, has a relatively flat profile. A wafer taken from the ingot at 6 zone lengths has a value nearly equal to that taken at 12 zone lengths. If one value is significantly higher than the other, a contamination has probably occurred, and the analysis should be repeated. Phosphorus, with a smaller segregation coefficient, has different values at the 6- and 12-zone length points. The midpoint should have a value about 10 to $1 5 \\%$ lower than the end point. If not, contamination is indicated and the analysis should be repeated. Carbon, with a very small segregation coefficient, varies greatly between the 6- and 12-zone length points. If not, contamination is indicated and the analysis should be repeated. Carbon value at the maximum ingot length should be reported. 12.6.3 Perpendicular Cores — For perpendicular cores (see Section 10.2.2), single crystal ingot size is about $1 4 \\mathrm { - m m }$ diameter\n\nSEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.6  Ingot Sampling (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1723-1104 PRACTICE FOR EVALUATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON RODS BY FLOAT-ZONE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.6  Ingot Sampling\n\nContent: with a length determined by the poly rod diameter, about $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ . For these ingots, sampling for acceptor-donor content is different than the carbon sampling, due to the small segregation coefficient for carbon.

Also profile conductivity type, in accordance with SEMI MF42, at $1 0 \\mathrm { - m m }$ intervals. Due to the segregation effects discussed in Section 12.6.2.1, characteristic purity of the filament, and other interferences discussed in Section 3, the resistivity profile will differ between laboratories.

The single crystal ingot length is correlated to the polysilicon rod diameter; take a slice at the representative midpoint between the filament and the outer skin of the polysilicon rod. Analyze this wafer for acceptor/donor values in accordance with SEMI MF1389 or SEMI MF1630. For the cross section of a polysilicon rod, these values represent the $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { { R } } } / 2$ location. If the resistivity/type profile has significant variation from the standard profile, other locations may be sampled to determine the distribution of each impurity.

Values are related to sample weight rather than area due to the irregular size and form of the sample.  \n1.3  This surface measurement of metal contamination is used for monitoring polysilicon production processes, development of new processes, and materials acceptance purposes.  \n1.4  This test method is used as a standard for defining detection limits, and quantifying variations and method interferences to allow interlaboratory correlations.\n\nSEMI MF1724-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1724-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method covers the quantitative determination of surface trace metal contamination on the surface of polycrystalline silicon chunks using an acid to extract the metals from the surface. The metals content of the acid is then diluted and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic-absorption spectroscopy. With suitable modifications that are not included herein, this method can be extended to analysis of granular and chip polysilicon. 2.2 This test method can be used for various rod, chunk, granule and chip sizes, for polycrystalline or single crystal silicon, to determine surface metal contaminants. Since the area of irregularly-shaped chunks, chips, or granules is difficult to measure accurately, values are based on sample weight. Using a sample weight of 50 to $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g }$ allows detection limits at the 0.01 ppbw (parts per billion weight) level. 2.3 The strength, composition, temperature, and exposure time of the acid determine the depth\n\nSEMI MF1724-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1724-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: of surface etching and the efficiency of the extraction of the contaminants from the surface. Less than $1 \\%$ of the sample weight is removed in this test method. 2.4 This test method is useful for determining the alkali elements, alkali earth, and first series transition elements, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, as well as other elements such as aluminum. The recovery of these elements from the silicon surface is measured as greater than $9 5 \\%$ , using control standards intentionally added to the polysilicon surface. 2.5 This test method suggests a particular sample size, acid composition, etch cycle, testing environment, and instrument protocol. Variations in these parameters may be used, but may affect the recovery efficiency or retention of metals during processing. In practice, this test method is used for sample weights of 25 to $5 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ .

This test method includes guidelines to alert the analyst to the interferences and resultant variations in this test method, and includes standard methods for quantifying and reporting these variations. 2.6 This test method specifies the use of graphite furnace atomic-absorption spectroscopy to analyze trace metals content of the acid extract. Other instruments of equivalent sensitivity, such as inductivelycoupled plasma/mass spectrometry, may be used. 2.7 The detection limit and method variation depend on the efficiency of the acid extraction procedure, sample size, the method interferences, the absorption spectrum of each element, and the instrumental sensitivity, background, and blank value. 2.8 This test method uses hot acid to etch away the surface of the silicon. The etchant is potentially harmful and must be handled in an acid exhaust fume hood, with utmost care at all times.

This test method describes a series of blanks and controls to monitor and quantify these interferences. 3.3 The recovery efficiency of the acid mixture and extraction process must be measured in order to monitor any interference from this source. Metal contaminants chemically bound to the surface by various treatments or in the bulk of the polysilicon may not be recovered by this acid mixture. Recovery efficiency can be confirmed by neutron activation analyses, or by another test method. 3.4 This test\n\nSEMI MF1724-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1724-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING SURFACE METAL CONTAMINATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON BY ACID EXTRACTION-ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: method requires a sample size representative of the lot sample.

Other samples may be specified in producer-consumer relationships. NOTE 1: Determination of the most logical point of sample selection may be established by inspection of the bottom taper of the crystal. If the crystal has a complete bottom taper, then the sample should be obtained from the last point of a full crystal diameter. If the crystal has lost zero dislocation growth before the formation of a tapered bottom, obtain the sample 1–crystal diameter above the point of lost zero dislocation structure. 9.2 Orient the ingot to be sliced with either the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray or optical method of SEMI MF26 so that the surface to be exposed is within $5 ^ { \\circ }$ of the desired plane. Slice a wafer, 0.5- to $2 \\mathrm { - m m }$ thick, from the crystal. Identify ingot growth lines on the sample by a mark or a ground flat for future reference in counting\n\nSEMI MF1725-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON INGOTS - # 9  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1725-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON INGOTS - # 9  Procedure\n\nContent: defects. NOTE 2: Defects observed by preferential etching may be increasingly distorted as misalignment from the major crystallographic plane increases. 9.3 Remove the residual saw damage by mechanical lapping and chemical polishing or by chemical polishing alone. 9.3.1 Wash the as-cut or lapped wafer in a nonionic surfactant detergent solution and rinse thoroughly in water. Drying may be hastened by use of a lint-free paper towel. The surface must be uniformly matte in appearance with no scratches, wax, dirt or water stains.\n\nSEMI MF1725-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON INGOTS - # 9.3.2  Chemical Polish (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1725-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON INGOTS - # 9.3.2  Chemical Polish\n\nContent: 9.3.2.1 Place the sample in the bottom of a hydrofluoric acid resistant beaker with the side to be inspected facing upward. The beaker diameter need only be larger than the wafer diameter. 9.3.2.2 Pour the room temperature chemical polish etch (from Section 7.3) until the surface of the sample is covered with about $1 \\mathrm { c m }$ of solution. 9.3.2.3 Agitate during etching to reduce bubble formation and surface artifacts. NOTE 3: The polish etch procedure in Section 9.3 describes a facility for evaluation of a small number of samples. More sophisticated facilities are used in commercial environments. 9.3.2.4 Rapidly dilute the etching solution with water and flush the solution from the beaker after the sample wafer develops mirror-polished surfaces. NOTE: The orientation of the wafer defines the location and direction of the line defects.

Crystal defects disturb local lattice energy conditions that are the basis for semiconductor behavior. These defects have distinct effects on essential semiconductordevice manufacturing processes such as alloying and diffusion. 1.2 Epitaxial growth processes are used extensively in the manufacture of silicon electronic devices. Stacking faults introduced during epitaxial growth can cause “soft” electrical characteristics and preferential micro plasma breakdowns in diodes. 1.3 Epitaxial defects are more clearly delineated with the use of this destructive etching procedure. Epitaxial wafers may however be classified nondestructively by this method without the destructive preferential etching and inspection steps. 1.4 This practice provides guidance regarding procedures for analysis of crystal defects of silicon ingots from which silicon wafers are cut. 1.5 This practice, together with the referenced\n\nSEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: standards, may be used for process control, research and development, and material acceptance purposes.\n\nSEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This practice covers the determination of the density of crystallographic defects in unpatterned polished and epitaxial silicon wafers. Epitaxial silicon wafers may exhibit dislocations, hillocks, shallow pits or epitaxial stacking faults, while polished wafers may exhibit several forms of crystallographic defects or surface damage. Use of this practice is based upon the application of several referenced standards in a prescribed sequence to reveal and count microscopic defects or structures. 2.2 This practice is suitable for use with epitaxial or polished wafers grown in either [111] or [100] direction and doped either $p$ or $n$ -type with resistivity greater than $0 . 0 0 5 \\Omega { \\cdot } \\mathrm { c m }$ . 2.3 This practice is suitable for use with epitaxial wafers with layer thickness greater than $0 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . 2.4 Additional requirements on the material to be tested are listed in SEMI MF1810.
