A first electrode 140 is connected to the first semiconductor layer 105 and a second electrode 145 is connected to the second semiconductor layer 115. An energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105 decreases as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. The energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105 may decrease step by step or linearly. The first semiconductor layer 105 may include an n-type nitride semiconductor layer containing indium - e.g,. indium gallium nitride (InGaN) — and a content of indium may increase as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. A display apparatus (DA, fig.5) may comprise an array substrate (TAS, fig.5) including a thin-film transistor (TFT, fig.5) and a first connection electrode (274, fig.5) connected to the thin- film transistor, a conductive adhesive layer (282, fig.5) disposed on the first connection electrode, and the light- emitting device ED1 disposed on the conductive adhesive layer.\n\nTechnical Field\n\n[0001] The present disclosure relates to a light-emitting device and a display apparatus including the same. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a light-emitting device capable of operating at low current, and a display apparatus capable of displaying an image at a low gray-scale.\n\nDiscussion of the Related Art\n\n[0002] A flat panel display apparatus includes a liquid crystal display apparatus and an organic light-emitting display apparatus. [0003] The organic light-emitting display apparatus has advantages such as improved luminous efficiency, a fast response speed, and a wide viewing angle compared to the liquid crystal display apparatus. However, since the organic light-emitting display apparatus includes an organic material, the organic light-emitting display apparatus is vulnerable to moisture and oxygen, and thus, a defective pixel may occur. [0004] Recently, an inorganic light-emitting display apparatus using an inorganic light- emitting layer that is resistant to moisture and oxygen has been proposed. The inorganic light-emitting display apparatus in which an inorganic light-emitting diode having a size of 100 micrometers or smaller is disposed in each pixel is referred to as a micro-light-emitting diode (micro-LED) display apparatus.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0005] A currently mass-produced inorganic light-emitting diode cannot operate in a low- current level due to a high potential barrier between a semiconductor layer and an electrode. Thus, the display apparatus cannot display an image at a low gray-scale level. [0006] Therefore, in order to provide an inorganic light-emitting display apparatus capable of display the image at a low gray-scale level, an inorganic light-emitting device capable of operating in a low current level is required. [0007] The inventors of the present disclosure have invented an inorganic light-emitting device that can operate at a low current level. [0008] Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a light-emitting device and a display apparatus including the same that substantially obviate one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. [0009] An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a light-emitting device capable of operating at the low-current level and a display apparatus capable of displaying an image at the low-gray-scale level. [0010] Additional features and aspects will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the inventive concepts provided herein. Other features and aspects of the inventive concepts may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description, or derivable therefrom, and the claims hereof as well as the appended drawings. [0011] To achieve these and other aspects of the inventive concepts, as embodied and broadly described herein, a light-emitting device comprises a light-emitting structure including a first semiconductor layer, an active layer, and a second semiconductor layer; a first electrode connected to the first semiconductor layer; and a second electrode connected to the second semiconductor layer, wherein an energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer decreases as the first semiconductor layer extends away from the active layer. [0012] In another aspect, a display including an array substrate comprises a thin-film transistor and a first connection electrode connected to the thin-film transistor; a conductive adhesive layer disposed on the first connection electrode; and a light-emitting device disposed on the conductive adhesive layer, wherein the light-emitting device includes: a light-emitting structure including a first semiconductor layer, an active layer, and a second semiconductor layer; a first electrode connected to the first semiconductor layer; and a second electrode connected to the second semiconductor layer, wherein an energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer decreases as the first semiconductor layer extends away from the active layer. [0013] Details of other embodiments are included in the detailed description and drawings. [0014] According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, a potential barrier between the first electrode and the first semiconductor layer (n-type semiconductor layer) in the light- emitting device may be lowered. As a result, driving voltage and driving current required for electrons to overcome a potential barrier between the first electrode and the first semiconductor layer and be injected into the first semiconductor layer may be lowered. Therefore, the light-emitting device according to embodiments of the present disclosure may operate in a low current level. [0015] The light-emitting device according to embodiments of the present disclosure is capable of operating at a low current level. Thus, the display apparatus in which the light- emitting device according to embodiments of the present disclosure is disposed in each sub- pixel may display an image having a gray-scale at a low current level. [0016] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the inventive concepts as claimed.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n[0017] The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosure and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate embodiments of the disclosure and together with the description serve to explain various principles.

[0035] Hereinafter, display apparatuses according to embodiments according to the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. [0036] FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing a light-emitting device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. [0037] Referring to FIG. 1, a light-emitting device ED1 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a light-emitting structure 120, a passivation layer 125, a first electrode 140, and a second electrode 145. The light-emitting device ED1 may have a vertical structure. A maximum horizontal width of the light-emitting device ED1 may be, for example, 100 um or smaller. The light-emitting device ED1 may be referred to as a micro-light- emitting diode LED (micro-LED). [0038] The light-emitting structure 120 may include a first semiconductor layer 105, an active layer 110, an electron blocking layer 113, and a second semiconductor layer 115. In one example, the light-emitting structure 120 may have a shape in which a width gradually decreases as the structure 120 extends in a direction from the first semiconductor layer 105 to the second semiconductor layer 115. In this case, a side surface of the light-emitting structure 120 may have an inclination. In other words, the light-emitting structure 120 may have a trapezoidal shape. [0039] The side surface of the light-emitting structure 120 may be covered with the passivation layer 125. The passivation layer 125 may extend along and on a portion of a top surface of the second semiconductor layer 115 and cover the portion of the top surface of the second semiconductor layer 115. The passivation layer 125 may be formed of, for example, an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon nitride, or aluminum oxide. [0040] The first electrode 140 is connected to the first semiconductor layer 105, and the second electrode 145 is connected to the second semiconductor layer 115. Since the light- emitting device ED1 has a vertical structure, the first electrode 140 may be referred to as a lower electrode and the second electrode 145 may be referred to as an upper electrode. When the first semiconductor layer 105 is an n-type semiconductor layer and the second semiconductor layer 115 is a p-type semiconductor layer, the first electrode 140 may be referred to as an n-side electrode and the second electrode 145 may be referred to as a p-side electrode. [0041] The light-emitting structure 120 may be made of, for example, a group III nitride semiconductor material. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. [0042] Each of the first semiconductor layer 105, the active layer 110, the electron blocking layer 113, and the second semiconductor layer 115 of the light-emitting structure 120 may be made of a group III nitride semiconductor material, that is, InxAlyGaqi-x-y)N(O<x<1, 0<y<1). [0043] The first semiconductor layer 105 may be a layer for supplying electrons to the active layer 110 and may be made of an n-type group III nitride semiconductor material doped with impurities such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te). An energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105 may decrease as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. The energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105 may decrease as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends toward the first electrode 140. The active layer 110 may be disposed between the first semiconductor layer 105 and the second semiconductor layer 115. [0044] For example, the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type indium gallium nitride (InGaN), that is, n-type InxGaq-xyN(O<x<1). An indium (In) content in the first semiconductor layer 105 may increase as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. [0045] The energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105 may decrease step by step as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. The indium content in the first semiconductor layer 105 may increase step by step as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. As used herein, references to a parameter increasing/decreasing step by step may be used to refer to the parameter increasing/decreasing stepwise or discontinuously or in a number of distinct spatial increments or in a number of distinct stages. In other words, the increase/decrease may not be smooth, but may instead comprise a number of abrupt or stepwise changes across respective layers. [0046] The first semiconductor layer 105 may include a plurality of layers having different indium contents. For example, the first semiconductor layer 105 includes 7 layers, and the indium content in the first semiconductor layer 105 may increase by 5 at% step by step. [0047] For example, the indium content in a seventh layer 105g disposed closest to the active layer 110 among the seven layers of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be 5 at%, and the content of indium in a sixth layer 105f disposed next closest to the active layer 110 among the seven layers of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be 10 at%. Further, the content of indium in a first layer 105a disposed farthest from the active layer 110 among the seven layers of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be 35 at%. The indium content of the first semiconductor layer 105 is measured based on an amount of an entirety of a group III element. [0048] The first layer 105a of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxGac1-x)N(x=0.35). The second layer 105b of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxGaq-xy)N(x=0.3). The third layer 105c of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxGac-s)N(x=0.25). The fourth layer 105d of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxGaqi-x)N(x=0.2). The fifth layer 105e of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxsGaq-s)N(x=0.15). The sixth layer 105f of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxGaq1-x)N(x=0.1). The seventh layer 105g of the first semiconductor layer 105 may be made of n-type InxGaq-x)N(x=0.05). [0049] The number of the layers included in the first semiconductor layer 105 and the indium contents therein may be designed to be different from those as described above. In addition, the maximum indium content of the layers included in the first semiconductor layer 105 may be determined in consideration of crystal quality or phase separation of the first semiconductor layer 105. [0050] The active layer 110 disposed on the first semiconductor layer 105 may have a multi- quantum well (MQW) structure. The active layer 110 may be a layer that emits light based on combination of electrons and holes. The multi-quantum well structure of the active layer 110 includes a plurality of barrier layers and a plurality of well layers. For example, the plurality of well layers may be made of indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and the plurality of barrier layers may be made of gallium nitride (GaN). The content of indium (In) in the well layer may be designed according to a wavelength of light emitted therefrom. The multi-quantum well structure of the active layer 110 is not limited to the details as described above. [0051] The electron blocking layer 113 disposed on the active layer 110 prevents electrons injected from the first semiconductor layer 105 into the active layer 110 from overflowing into the second semiconductor layer 115. The electron blocking layer 113 may be made of a p-type group III nitride semiconductor material doped with impurities such as magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), or beryllium (Be). The electron blocking layer 113 may include, for example, p-type aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), that is, p-type AlyGag-yyN(0<y<1). In one embodiment, the electron blocking layer 113 may be omitted. [0052] The second semiconductor layer 115 disposed on the electron blocking layer 113 may be a layer for injecting holes into the active layer 110 and may be made of a p-type group III nitride semiconductor material doped with impurities such as magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), or beryllium (Be). The second semiconductor layer 115 may include, for example, p-type gallium nitride (GaN). [0053] The first electrode 140 may be disposed on a lower surface 105bs of the first semiconductor layer 105, and may be composed of a single layer or a plurality of layers made of at least one metal of nickel (Ni), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), or an alloy thereof. [0054] As described above, the energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105 may decrease stepwise as the first semiconductor layer 105 extends away from the active layer 110. The first layer 105a of the first semiconductor layer 105 contacting the first electrode 140 has the smallest energy bandgap. [0055] Accordingly, a potential barrier between the first electrode 140 and the first semiconductor layer 105 may be lowered. As a result, driving voltage and driving current required for electrons to overcome a potential barrier between the first electrode 140 and the first semiconductor layer 105 and be injected into the first semiconductor layer 105 may be lowered. Therefore, the light-emitting device ED1 can operate in a low current level. [0056] The second electrode 145 disposed on an upper surface of the second semiconductor layer 115 may be compose of a single layer or a plurality of layers made of at least one metal of nickel (Ni), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), or an alloy thereof. [0057] An ohmic contact layer may be further disposed between the second semiconductor layer 115 and the second electrode 145. The ohmic contact layer may include a transparent conductive oxide such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), IGZO (Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide), or IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide). [0058] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view showing a light-emitting device according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. [0059] Referring to FIG. 2, a light-emitting device ED2 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure may include a light-emitting structure 120', the passivation layer 125, the first electrode 140, and the second electrode 145. The light-emitting device ED2 may have a vertical structure. A maximum horizontal width of the light-emitting device ED2 may be, for example, 100 um or smaller. The light-emitting device ED2 may be referred to as a micro-light-emitting diode (Micro-LED). The features and arrangement of FIG. 2 may correspond to the features and arrangement of FIG. 1 except where indicated otherwise. [0060] The light-emitting structure 120' may include a first semiconductor layer 105', the active layer 110, the electron blocking layer 113, and the second semiconductor layer 115. [0061] The first semiconductor layer 105' may be a layer for supplying electrons to the active layer 110, and may be made of an n-type group III nitride semiconductor material doped with impurities such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), selenium (Se), or tellurium (Te). An energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105' may decrease as the first semiconductor layer 105’ extends away from the active layer 110. The energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105' may decrease as the first semiconductor layer 105’ extends toward the first electrode 140. [0062] For example, the first semiconductor layer 105' may be made of n-type indium gallium nitride (InGaN), that is, n-type InxGaq-.N(0<x<1). The indium (In) content in the first semiconductor layer 105' may increase as the first semiconductor layer 105’ extends away from the active layer 110. [0063] The energy bandgap of the first semiconductor layer 105’ may decrease linearly or gradually as the first semiconductor layer 105’ extends away from the active layer 110. The indium content in the first semiconductor layer 105’ may linearly or gradually increase as the first semiconductor layer 105’ extends away from the active layer 110. A lower surface 105bs of the first semiconductor layer 105' in contact with the first electrode 140 may have the highest indium content and may have the smallest energy bandgap. As used herein, references to a parameter increasing/decreasing linearly or gradually may be used to refer to the parameter increasing/decreasing continuously or smoothly. [0064] Accordingly, a potential barrier between the first electrode 140 and the first semiconductor layer 105' may be lowered. As a result, driving voltage and driving current required for electrons to overcome a potential barrier between the first electrode 140 and the first semiconductor layer 105' and be injected into the first semiconductor layer 105' may be lowered. Therefore, the light-emitting device ED2 may operate in a low current level. [0065] FIG. 3 shows a I-V curve of each of embodiments of the present disclosure. FIG. 4 shows the internal quantum efficiency of each of embodiments of the present disclosure. [0066] A curve marked with 'Ref in each of FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 is directed to Comparative Example. A light-emitting device according to the Comparative Example is the same as each of the first and second embodiments except that the first semiconductor layer is made of n- type GaN. [0067] The curves marked with 'ED1' and 'ED2' in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 indicate simulation results of the light-emitting device ED1 as the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1, and the light-emitting device ED2 as the second embodiment shown in FIG. 2, respectively. In FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the curve of the light-emitting device ED1 overlaps with the curve of the light- emitting device ED2. Therefore, only the curve of the light-emitting device ED2 is shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. [0068] Referring to FIG. 3, it may be identified that each of the light-emitting devices ED1 and ED2 according to the first and second embodiments has lower operation voltage at the same current than that in the light-emitting device Ref according to the Comparative Example. This means that the light-emitting devices ED1 and ED2 according to the first and second embodiments can operate in a lower current level than a current level at which the light- emitting device Ref according to the Comparative Example operates. [0069] Referring to FIG. 4, it may be identified that decrease in the internal quantum efficiency in each of the light-emitting devices ED1 and ED2 according to the first and second embodiments is comparable to decrease in the internal quantum efficiency in the light-emitting device Ref according to the Comparative Example. [0070] In summary, the light-emitting devices ED1 and ED2 according to the first and second embodiments may have the lower operation voltage than that of the light-emitting device Ref according to the Comparative Example, while maintaining a similar level of the internal quantum efficiency to that of the light-emitting device Ref according to the Comparative Example. Therefore, a display apparatus using each of the light-emitting devices ED1 and ED2 according to the first and second embodiments may display an image having a gray-scale level at a low current level. [0071] FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing a display apparatus according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. FIG. 5 includes a cross-sectional structure of one sub- pixel of a display apparatus DA according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. [0072] Referring to FIG. 5, a display apparatus DA according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes an array substrate TAS and the light-emitting device ED1 mounted on the array substrate TAS. FIG. 5 shows that the light-emitting device ED1 as shown in FIG. | is mounted on the array substrate TAS. However, the light-emitting device ED2 as shown in FIG. 2 may be mounted thereon. The light-emitting device ED1 may be mounted onto the array substrate TAS in a transfer process. [0073] A pixel driving circuit for driving the light-emitting device ED1 may be included in the array substrate TAS. For example, the array substrate TAS may include a base substrate 200, and a thin-film transistor TFT, a line, and an electrode disposed on the base substrate 200. [0074] The thin-film transistor TFT may include a semiconductor layer 220 formed on the base substrate 200, a gate electrode 230 located on the semiconductor layer 220, a gate insulating layer 225 between the semiconductor layer 220 and the gate electrode 230, and a source/drain electrode 260. [0075] A buffer layer 205 and a light-blocking layer 210 may be disposed between the base substrate 200 and the semiconductor layer 220. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. [0076] The buffer layer 205 may prevent diffusion of impurities or moisture from the base substrate 200 toward the thin-film transistor TFT, and may include an inorganic insulating material. In one example, the buffer layer 205 may include silicon nitride or silicon oxide. The buffer layer 205 may be formed as a single layer or a stack of multiple layers. [0077] For example, when the semiconductor layer 220 includes a metal oxide semiconductor, the light-blocking layer 210 serves to prevent light from being introduced into the semiconductor layer 220. A size of the light-blocking layer 210 is preferably larger than that of the semiconductor layer 220 such that the light-blocking layer 210 entirely cover the semiconductor layer 220. The light-blocking layer 210 may be composed of a single layer or a stack of multiple layers including at least one of titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), chromium (Cr), gold (Au), neodymium (Nd), or nickel (Ni).
