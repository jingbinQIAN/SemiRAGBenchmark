The supplier should design a standard interface panel layout that supports a given equipment type and all associated revisions. 6.5.2 Common connector technologies, types, and sizes should be utilized along with provisions for containment of hazardous materials. Typically, hazardous production material connections are contained within the equipment 6.5.3 Spacing of multiple gas and liquid connections on the interface panel should provide sufficient access and spacing for installation and\n\nSEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 6.5  Equipment Point of Connection Interface Panel (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 6.5  Equipment Point of Connection Interface Panel\n\nContent: maintenance for multiple lines (i.e., orbital weld head, wrench, and test fittings).\n\nSEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 7  Pre-facilitation Recommendations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 7  Pre-facilitation Recommendations\n\nContent: 7.1 The pre-facilitation strategy should provide the device manufacturer with the ability to efficiently and accurately install UPOC’s prior to equipment delivery, allowing immediate hook-up of the equipment upon arrival to the fab. The equipment supplier should provide a template and/or jig, as well as a EPOC interface panel (if applicable) or pre-facilitation pedestal prior to the equipment delivery as part of a strategy to support accurate pre-facilitation of utility points of connection. In situations where a pedestal is being utilized (see Section 7.4), the pedestal can serve as an aide to pre-facilitation. The supplier and device manufacturer should discuss and agree on the chosen strategy. 7.2 Templates: The template provides a twodimensional guide that projects EPOC locations to a two-dimensional surface, typically the floor. This would allow the device manufacturer to open popouts, core holes, etc., and pre-facilitate to a point close to, but not necessarily including, the UPOC.\n\nSEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 7  Pre-facilitation Recommendations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 7  Pre-facilitation Recommendations\n\nContent: See Figure 1 for a representative example of a Template. 7.3 Jigs: The jig provides a guide that locates the - EPOC’s in three-dimensional space. This would allow the device manufacturer to pre-facilitate to the UPOC’s or at least prefabricate the facility lines and UPOC’s such that final hookup could be accomplished immediately after setting the equipment. See Figure 2 for a representative example of a Jig. 7.4 Pre-facilitation Pedestal: Application notes and three representative examples of using pedestals to support pre-facilitation are included in the related information section at the end of this document.\n\nSEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 8  Documentation Recommendations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E76-0299 GUIDE FOR 300 mm PROCESS EQUIPMENT POINTS OF CONNECTION TO FACILITY SERVICES - # 8  Documentation Recommendations\n\nContent: 8.1 Equipment suppliers should provide the following documentation concerning equipment point of connections and/or template, jig, and pre-facilitation pedestal to the device manufacturers.

This test method does not purport to address the safety considerations associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before using this method.  \n10.2  Follow the manufacturer’s specifications and instructions for installation and operation whenever possible.  Note any exceptions in the test report.\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 11  Test Specimen\n\n11.1  Allow all components in the test apparatus to warm up following the manufacturer’s specification.  \n11.2  Take necessary steps when switching gases to ensure that only the desired gas is in the D.U.T.  and flow standard at the time the test is performed.\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12  Preparation of Apparatus\n\n12.1  Locate the D.U.T.  in the test environment to stabilize temperature for 24 hours prior to warm up.  \n12.2  The reference operating conditions shall be as follows:\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12.2.1  Ambient Temperature — $2 3 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12.2.1  Ambient Temperature — $2 3 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$\n\nContent: 12.2.2 Gas Temperature — Same as ambient. In the case of a condensible gas, the gas temperature should be maintained as a gradient, with highest temperature at the outlet end of the test set up, and slightly reduced temperatures back to the source. This will ensure that condensing vapors do not accumulate in the test set up. Gradient should simulate actual process parameters where the MFC will be installed. 12.2.3 Ambient Pressure — 101.3 kPa ( $^ +$ 4.7 or – 15.3 kPa) 12.2.4 Gas Pressure, Inlet — $1 7 2 \\pm 3 4 ~ \\mathrm { k P a }$ unless the gas is not capable of delivering this pressure, then normal fab operating conditions should be observed. 12.2.5 Gas Pressure, Outlet — < 80 kPa 12.2.6 Relative Humidity $4 0 \\% \\pm 5 \\%$ , noncondensing (suggestion: record if outside this range) 12.2.7 Magnetic Field — $\\le 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { T }$ 12.2.8 Electromagnetic Field — $\\leq 1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { V / m }$ 12.2.9 Vibration — $\\leq 0 . 5\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12.2.1  Ambient Temperature — $2 3 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12.2.1  Ambient Temperature — $2 3 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$\n\nContent: \\mathrm { m / s }$ at 50 to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ 12.3 Following the conditioning period (See Section 12.1), warm up the device according to manufacturer’s specifications. 12.4 Perform an adequate nitrogen purge to ensure all previous gases and moisture have been removed from the system.

Introduce the test gas at a sufficient rate and time to ensure the test apparatus is completely filled with the test gas and only the test gas. 12.6 Record the zero offset with line pressure inside the MFC to best simulate normal operating conditions. Line pressure during testing is to be $1 7 0 . 3 0 \\ \\mathrm { k P a }$ (24.7 psia) unless safety practices for the gas under test dictate that a\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12.2.1  Ambient Temperature — $2 3 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 12.2.1  Ambient Temperature — $2 3 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$\n\nContent: lower line pressure be used.

Record the data on the form in Table 1. 13.1.1 When a non-zero setpoint is given, allow the MFC to stabilize at the desired setpoint by observing the reading on the flow standard. Record the data once the MFC has stabilized at the current setpoint. NOTE 2: If, during data acquisition at a nominal setpoint, the instrument fails to stabilize, the D.U.T. is not stable enough for the test to proceed. 13.1.2 When a zero setpoint is given, perform the procedure described in Sections 12.7–12.9 (do not rezero the MFC) to ensure a “no-flow” condition through the MFC and record the zero offset indicated by the MFC’s output in Table 1. 13.2 Use Table 1 to record the following: 13.2.1 Column\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 13  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: A — D.U.T. setpoint $( \\%$ F.S.) 13.2.2 Column B — D.U.T. flow indication ( $\\%$ F.S.) 13.2.3 Column $C$ — Raw flow standard reading (sccm)\n\nSEMI E77-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CALCULATION OF CONVERSION FACTORS FOR A MASS FLOW CONTROLLER USING SURROGATE GASES - # 14  Calculations or Interpretation of Results\n\n14.1  For each test gas, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the corrected flow readings, for common setpoints on the same gas.

It is a guide for establishing electrostatic compatibility of equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing. 1.2 Electrostatic surface charge causes a number of undesirable effects in semiconductor manufacturing environments. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damages both products and reticles. ESD events also cause electromagnetic interference (EMI), resulting in equipment malfunctions. Charged wafer and reticle surfaces attract particles (electrostatic attraction or ESA) and increase the defect rate. Charge on products can also result in equipment malfunction or product breakage. Operating problems and additional product defects due to static charge can have a negative impact on the cost of ownership of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (refer to SEMI E35). 1.3 An increasing amount of semiconductor\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: production is done in minienvironments or within the production equipment.

The nature of the object (insulator or conductor), its geometry, its surroundings, and the measuring equipment itself, are only a few of the factors affecting the accuracy of an electrostatic measurement. 3.1.1 Similarly, it is difficult to relate the measurement of an electrostatic quantity to its effect on products or equipment. For example, an ESD simulator produces a standardized discharge waveform when a capacitor is discharged at a known voltage. This device is used to establish the ESD damage threshold for semiconductor products, or the effect of ESD on equipment. While the amount of charge transferred is known $( \\mathsf { q } = \\mathsf { C V } )$ , the maximum current that results is not.

It will be necessary to obtain an instrument with a large enough “cup” for wafers, cassettes, and other equipment parts. It will also be necessary to get the objects into the cup without altering their charge levels. Further information on making these measurements should be available from the manufacturers of the measuring equipment. 6.2.5 The user should determine with an ESD simulator what levels of ESD cause product, or reticle damage. The equipment manufacturer will need to determine with an ESD simulator what levels of static charge cause equipment damage.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6  Requirements\n\n6.1  Measurement Methods and Instrumentation — No single method of testing for static charge can determine a “safe” level. The amount of static charge, the distribution of static charge on an object, and the nature of the static discharge will all interact to determine if the charge level is safe. It will be difficult to determine levels that guarantee static related problems are totally eliminated. The goal of this guide is to assist the user in identifying static charge levels likely to cause problems in process equipment. This guide should provide the user with enough insight to define a test methodology for each static problem and understand its limitations.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.2  ESD Damage\n\n6.2.1  When considering direct ESD damage to an object (product, reticle, or equipment), the important parameter is the current accompanying the charge transfer to or from the object. Under a fixed set of test parameters, the damaging amount of current due to the charge transfer to or from the object can be determined. Established test methods exist for determining the threshold of damage to a particular object. ESD  \n6.2.6  It will be the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer to demonstrate that equipment operation does not generate more than the allowable amount of charge on product, carriers or equipment parts. This is shown in Section 7, Figure 2.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Particle Attraction (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Particle Attraction\n\nContent: 6.3.1 Electrostatic attraction (ESA) of particles can occur due to the electrostatic field created by the charge on the surface of an object. Both the field strength and, usually to a lesser degree, the divergence of the field influence the electrostatic contribution to particle deposition velocity. Electrostatic particle deposition velocity also depends on particle size and particle electrical charge. Unfortunately, even under controlled laboratory conditions, accurate measurements of electric field strength, particle size distribution, and, especially, particle charge, are difficult. Of these three parameters, electric field measurements are the most likely to be available. 6.3.2 Measurements of electrostatic field can be made with a commonly available electrostatic fieldmeter. The units of electrostatic field are volts/cm (volts/inch). Precise measurements will be difficult as the presence of the measuring instrument changes the field\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Particle Attraction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Particle Attraction\n\nContent: characteristics and may overstate the actual level of electrostatic field. This is shown in Section 7, Figure 3. SEMI E43 describes measurement techniques using an electrostatic fieldmeter. 6.3.3 Electrostatic deposition velocity depends only on electric field, particle size and particle charge. However, the concentration of particles deposited on a surface also depends on the particle concentration in the equipment area and the length of the exposure time during which particle deposition occurs. Mechanisms other than electrostatic deposition, such as gravitational settling and diffusion, can also contribute to particle deposition. The concentration of particles deposited by these non-electrostatic mechanisms will also vary with particle concentration in the equipment ambient and exposure time. 6.3.4 Comparisons of the electrostatic deposition velocity with the deposition velocities associated with these other deposition mechanisms is the\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Particle Attraction (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Particle Attraction\n\nContent: key for determining threshold values of allowed electrostatic field from the viewpoint of particle deposition. Such comparisons are the basis for estimating the allowed values of electrostatic field presented in Appendix A1- 2.2 and Related Information R1-2. Users and equipment manufacturers should determine and agree on ambient particle sizes and concentrations, and product exposure times.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD\n\nContent: 6.4.1 Equipment ESD immunity is being addressed in general through a number of international standards including IEC 61000-4-2 and BS EN 61000-6-2 for European CE compliance. Measurements are made using an ESD simulator which is described in these standards. 6.4.2 The ESD simulator is used to create both a direct discharge to the surface of the equipment and an air discharge to a surface $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ (4 inches) away from the equipment. The ESD simulator charges a 150 picofarad capacitor (C) to a known voltage (V) and then discharges it to produce a standardized discharge waveform. Knowing the voltage and capacitance involved in this test means the total charge can be calculated by the equation $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { q } } = \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { C } } \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { V } }$ . For example, a 4000 volt discharge (IEC 61000-4-2 test level) transfers a charge, $\\mathtt { q } = 6 0 0$ nanocoulombs. 6.4.3 The value of the\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD\n\nContent: capacitor (C) in the ESD simulator is specified in the international standards. It should not be assumed that a different value of capacitance and voltage that produce the same charge transfer of 600 nanocoulombs would have the same affect on a specific piece of equipment. Discharge currents will vary with the impedance of the discharge path and with the voltage. It is, however, impractical to test all possible combinations. For the purposes of this guide, the parameters of the ESD simulator specified in the standards for equipment ESD immunity will be used. 6.4.4 For true ESD immunity, an ESD event in equipment must not disturb either the equipment it occurs in, or another nearby piece of equipment. Charge on product or carriers transferred from one piece of equipment must not disturb the operation of subsequent equipment. It will be a systems issue to make sure that all equipment in a facility meets the required ESD immunity standards. 6.4.5\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD\n\nContent: The range of reactions in equipment to an ESD event runs from transient errors that are automatically corrected, to hard errors that cannot be corrected without manual intervention or damage the equipment. While small numbers of transient errors may be acceptable from the point of view of equipment operation, they may still cause unacceptable product losses. 6.4.6 The user and manufacturer must determine with an ESD simulator what levels of ESD cause equipment interruptions. The user must determine if any of these equipment interruptions caused by ESD are acceptable. 6.4.7 In setting a level to provide ESD immunity for an individual piece of equipment from static charge on products and carriers, the charge on these items should be kept below the levels determined by ESD simulator testing. 6.4.8 The Faraday Cup measurement can be used for this purpose. If equipment has been tested for ESD immunity and passes a 4000 volt test, then total charge on\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Equipment ESD\n\nContent: product and carriers leaving this equipment should be kept below 600 nanocoulombs. Any product transferred at this level should not be handled by other equipment with a lower ESD immunity. A possible implementation of this test method is shown in Section 7, Figure 4.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 7  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 7  Apparatus\n\nContent: 7.1 ESD Damage — The apparatus for determining the ESD damage thresholds for products will depend on the test methods used. See Section 4 for additional information. For measuring the charge generated on product, reticles, or carriers, the Faraday Cup test method is shown in Figure 1. 7.1.1 The relationship between ESD simulator testing for product damage and charge measurements using the Faraday cup is shown in Figure 2. Electrostatic Field Measurement Figure 4 ESD Immunity Testing 7.2 The instrument used for making electrostatic field measurements is known as an electrostatic fieldmeter. Instructions concerning its use should be obtained from the instrument manufacturer and SEMI E43. The measurement configuration shown in Figure 3 illustrates the effect of the instrument on the measurement. In most cases the presence of the fieldmeter will increase both the flux from the charged surface and the divergence of the electric field lines. The fieldmeter\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 7  Apparatus (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 7  Apparatus\n\nContent: will generally indicate a higher value of electric field than would be present without the fieldmeter. 7.3 The instrumentation and test methods for determining the ESD sensitivity of equipment are described by IEC 6100-4-2 or other acceptable test methods. The amount of static charge determined by this test method is to be compared with the charge measured on products and carriers with the Faraday Cup test method. Figure 4 illustrates the two methods.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 8  Safety Precautions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 8  Safety Precautions\n\nContent: 8.1 Personnel — Static charges can create safety hazards during some semiconductor production processes. ESA or ESD events that result in the jamming or breakage of product in high speed equipment may create a personnel hazard. ESD events that produce sparks must be prevented in areas that use flammable or explosive chemicals or gases. ESD events to personnel are usually not harmful, but they may result in an unwanted reflex, or “startle” reaction. This reflex may create a personnel hazard, particularly in the vicinity of moving equipment or where caustic chemicals are in use. It may be necessary to use additional static charge control methods, beyond those used inside the equipment, to minimize these personnel hazards. 8.2 Measurement Safety — Users should exercise caution while making static charge measurements in the vicinity of moving parts of production equipment, or in areas where static potentials on ungrounded conductors may exceed\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 8  Safety Precautions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # 8  Safety Precautions\n\nContent: 30,000 volts.

A1-2.1.2 Industry Device Damage Levels — Each of the test methods, HBM, MM, and CDM have a set of qualification levels defined. These are contained below. A1-2.1.3 Charge Levels for ESD Damage — As discussed in Related Information R1-1.4, ESD Simulator testing uses different capacitances for each model. For HBM it is 100 picofarads, for MM it is 200 picofarads, and for CDM it depends on the capacitance of the actual device being tested.

This document deals primarily with ESD occurring within equipment. HBM type ESD discharges are the least likely to occur within equipment. Charged equipment parts contacting devices (MM) and charged devices contacting machine parts (CDM) are the most likely causes of ESD damage to devices in equipment. The following sensitivity levels are defined with respect to the existing industry MM and CDM classifications.

Equipment should not create or store charge on itself or on devices in excess of the guide recommendation. Guide recommendation (table 1 in Section 12.5) – 100 nanocoulombs. A1-2.1.4.2 Level 3 — Devices are affected by moderate levels of static charge in equipment. Devices pass testing for MM Class M4 $4 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ } \\times 2 0 0$ picofarads $\\mathbf { \\delta } = 8 0$ nanocoulombs) and most of MM Class M3 (over 250 volts $\\times 2 0 0$ picofarads $= 5 0$ nanocoulombs).

A1-2.2.1.2 Target values for $N / A$ are given in the National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS, 1994).

For individual processing steps making up the fabrication sequence the target values are lower yet. A1-2.2.1.3 The variables $c$ and $t$ are process step dependent and may or may not be controllable. Clearly minimizing both of these variables is desirable in order to minimize particle deposition on a wafer in any environment. A1-2.2.1.4 The only variable in Equation 12 that depends on electrical forces is $\\nu _ { e l e c t } .$ . Both the particle charge and the electric field in the vicinity of the wafer affect the magnitude of $\\nu _ { e l e c t }$ . Particle charge is generally unknown unless it is deliberately controlled by a neutralizing action, such as flooding the environment with both positive and negative charges. Under these conditions a Fuchs type charge distribution is a reasonable assumption for the particle charge. This assumption was used to\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.2  Recommendations for Particle Deposition (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.2  Recommendations for Particle Deposition\n\nContent: calculate the values of $E _ { \\theta }$ in Table R1-2 of Related Information R1-2.3.2. A1-2.2.1.5 When the environmental electric field is less than $E _ { 0 }$ , deposition of electrically “neutralized” particles is dominated by diffusion. When the environmental electric field is greater than $E _ { \\theta } ,$ , electrostatic forces dominate particle deposition even when particle charge has been “neutralized.” Values of $E _ { 0 }$ for a Fuchs charge distribution can be calculated from Related Information R1-2.3.2 Equation 10. For particle charge greater than the Fuchs charge, velect increases by a factor of $q / q _ { F u c h s }$ . Unfortunately, the actual particle charge $q$ is generally unknown. A1-2.2.1.6 Using the process step values of $c$ and $t$ and the value of $\\nu _ { e l e c t }$ calculated from Equation 10, the value of N/A for any process step can be estimated.

Calculations made for Federal Standard 209E Class 1 ( $\\mathrm { c } \\leq 0 . 0 0 1 2 4$ particles $/ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 \\cdot }$ ). 2. The value of the electrostatic field is referenced at a distance of one wafer radius from the wafer.

Measurements made at this smaller distance will be\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.2  Recommendations for Particle Deposition (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.2  Recommendations for Particle Deposition\n\nContent: proportionally higher, but under varying measurement conditions, it is difficult to determine a precise relationship between electric field and measurement distance. To provide a suitable safety factor, assume a linear relationship, rather than one proportional to the square of the distance. For example, with a $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ wafer, 4000 Volts/cm at $2 . 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ would result in 1000 Volts/cm at $1 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ , rather than 250 Volts/cm. 3.

The testing mandated by the EEC uses the test methods and ESD immunity levels specified in IEC 6100-4-2. A recent survey of 262 semiconductor equipment suppliers revealed that $71 \\%$ were compliant with the EEC requirements. There is an expectation that all equipment to be used in future 300 mm wafer fabrication will meet or exceed the ESD immunity requirements of IEC 6100-4-2. A1-2.3.1.1 To test for compliance, measurements were made with the ESD simulator described by IEC 6100-4- 2 on a representative sample of semiconductor equipment. The results were as follows: “X” indicates that the equipment passes ESD simulator testing at this level. NOTE 1: This level is subject to negotiation and has to be specified in the dedicated equipment specification.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.3 Guide Recommendations for Equipment Malfunctions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.3 Guide Recommendations for Equipment Malfunctions\n\nContent: If higher voltages than those shown are specified, special test equipment may be needed. A1-2.3.2 Static Audit — While equipment may meet the ESD immunity levels specified in IEC 6100-4-2, it should be remembered that static charge levels in manufacturing environments may be substantially higher. Direct measurements of static charge are difficult, and the presence of a charge does not always imply that an ESD event causing an equipment malfunction will occur. Some information may be gained by using a fieldmeter to measure the electrostatic field created by the surface charge. Instruments known as EMI locators may also be used in some cases to determine if ESD-related EMI is occurring. Some representative measurements of electric fields from objects in various areas of a semiconductor wafer fab are as follows: Wet Etch — 0.1 kV/inch to 30 kV/inch Planarization — 0.1 kV/inch to 20 kV/inch Lithography — 0.1\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.3 Guide Recommendations for Equipment Malfunctions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # A1-2.3 Guide Recommendations for Equipment Malfunctions\n\nContent: kV/inch to 20 kV/inch Dry Etch — 0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch Thin Film — 0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch Diffusion — 0.1 kV/inch to 30 kV/inch Implant — 0.1 kV/inch to 15 kV/inch A1-2.3.2.1 A knowledge of object capacitance and other physical properties is needed to determine if any of the above measurements indicate an equipment hazard due to ESD events. However, the range of the measurements strongly indicate that such ESD events can occur. The examples in Related Information R1-3.3 support this conclusion. A1-2.3.3 Guide Recommendations — Based on the static audits and equipment test data, there appears to be a wide range of static immunity in equipment as well as in the static charge levels in work environments. As stated previously, it is difficult to establish a direct correlation between ESD events and fieldmeter measurements made on products, carriers, or any other objects in the work environment.

Henry, Ph.D., Advanced Micro Devices, EOS/ESD/LU/EMC Department, Sunnyvale, CA 94538, leogesd@pacbell.net. R1-1.1 Introduction — ESD damage to devices occurs when they come into contact with personnel and equipment. Either may store a residual charge large enough to destroy the device if a discharge occurs. In the semiconductor industry, it has been established that a significant proportion of customer field returns are attributed to damage resulting from ESD. R1-1.2 Description of ESD Damage Mechanisms ESD failures are the result of either a current-induced phenomenon or a charge-induced phenomenon, and the damage can either be junction, contact, dielectric or oxide related. The apparent similarity in currentinduced damage resulting from ESD due to human body model discharges (HBM) or machine model discharges (MM) results from the thermal nature of both of these process. The HBM and MM damages result when the temperature\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1  ESD Damage (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1  ESD Damage\n\nContent: (joule heating) of the region dissipating the ESD pulse energy reaches a critical value and melting occurs. R1-1.2.1 Charge-induced phenomena are predicted by the charged device model (CDM). For CDM type discharges, oxide punch through occurs when the ESD voltage applied across the oxide creates a high enough field to break down the oxide. Excessive current flow results, causing an oxide short, but there is no heat transfer (adiabatic process). R1-1.2.2 It should be noted here that the time duration for typical ESD events from charged objects and personnel ranges from 10 to 100 nanoseconds, while CDM type events occur in less than 1 nanosecond.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.3  Device Testing Models (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.3  Device Testing Models\n\nContent: R1-1.3.1 Human Body Model (HBM) — The Human Body Model is the oldest and the most widely used of the three ESD models. The model attempts to replicate the discharge from a real human when the latter touches a device that is at a lower potential. The human capacitance and resistance have been ideally chosen to be 100 picofarads and 1500 ohms respectively. The values were chosen after measurements were made on humans in varying positions with respect to their surroundings. The resulting discharge waveform has a double exponential shape with risetime range of 2–10 nsec and a decay constant ( $\\mathrm { i } / \\mathrm { e }$ position) of $1 5 0 \\pm 2 0$ nsecs. The typical peak currents range from 0.67 Amps at 1000 volts to 2.67 Amps at 4000 volts. R1-1.3.2 Machine Model (MM) — The Machine Model is described by Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) as a worst case HBM. The model attempts to replicate the discharge from a\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.3  Device Testing Models (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.3  Device Testing Models\n\nContent: metallic arm of an automatic handler coming into contact with the metallic leads of a semiconductor device which is at a lower potential. A capacitance of 200 picofarads and ideally zero resistance produces a sinusoidal decaying waveform with an effective pulse duration of 200 nsec. The typical peak currents range from 1.75 Amps at 100 volts to 14.0 Amps at 800 volts. Note that MM failures occur at 5–10 times lower voltage than HBM. R1-1.3.3 Charged Device Model (CDM) — The Charged Device Model in its purest form is actually a field induced model because the device is actually part of model. This model attempts to describe a device which itself becomes charged due to an external field, or due to triboelectric charging of the device surfaces. During discharge, the parasitics (capacitance, inductance and impedance) in the device play a significant role in the resulting failure. The discharge pulse is a sinusoidal waveform with an\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.3  Device Testing Models (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.3  Device Testing Models\n\nContent: extremely fast risetime of less than 500 picoseconds. The waveform decays rapidly with a total pulse duration of less than 5 nano-seconds. The peak currents range from 2.0 Amps at 250 volts charging voltage, to 18.0 Amps at 2000 volts charging voltage. R1-1.3.4 Correlation Between Models — There is much debate on whether or not there is any type of correlation between HBM and MM. While some companies report a correlation of roughly 10:1 between the two models, other companies have seen anywhere from 5–20:1 differences in passing voltages between the two models. There is also no established voltage correlation between CDM damage and HBM or MM ESD events. In equipment, ESD damage events will be related to the MM or CDM types of ESD. Users will need to determine the type of ESD hazard to their devices and choose the test method accordingly.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.4  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-1.4  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing\n\nContent: R1-1.4.1 Description of Test Methods — Test procedures discussed here for ESD simulation conform to those established by the ESD Association Standards ESD STM 5.1 (for HBM), ESD S5.2 (for MM), and MIL-STD-883, C/3015.7-method 8. The ESD Association is presently considering two documents related to CDM Testing. Details are to be found in these standards. R1-1.4.1.1 Devices are qualified at a level corresponding to the highest ESD stress they are able to withstand. These levels are discussed in more detail in Appendix A1-2.1. R1-1.4.2 Simulation Test Results — In general all units must be data-logged both pre- and post-stress test. Any leakage current equal to or greater than a specific amount (company dependent — typically 10 microamps or less) is “flagged” as a failure, and any current shift greater than about 200 nano-Amp is marked on the record.

Cooper, Ph.D., The Texwipe Company, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458. R1-2.1 Introduction — The presence of excess electrical charge on a wafer can create an electrostatic field that will lead to accelerated deposition of particles onto the wafer. This undesirable consequence is but one of several threats to product yield posed by the presence of excess electrical charge on a wafer. Sections R1-1 and R1-3 of this related information discuss two other important and potentially damaging consequences of surface charge. R1-2.1.1 The purpose of the discussion in this section is to estimate the magnitude of electrostatic field that can be tolerated before electrostatically enhanced particle deposition becomes the dominant particle deposition mechanism. Over the particle size range 0.01 to $0 . 3 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , diffusion is the dominant, non-electrostatic\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: mechanism of particle deposition. Thus, values of electrostatic fields that do not produce particle deposition velocities greater than those attributable to particle diffusion will be deemed tolerable. A set of such values calculated under a specific and very restrictive set of conditions are presented in this section. R1-2.2 Theoretical Background — Although there are numerous electrostatic interactions between particles and surfaces, the dominant one is almost always the “Coulombic” interaction: the attraction (or repulsion) of a charged particle by a charged surface. This is the only electrostatic effect considered here. For particles of one diameter, $d$ , and one charge, $q$ , the particle deposition flux, $j ,$ , (the number of particles deposited per unit area per unit time) is the product of aerosol particle number concentration, $c$ ; particle charge, $q$ ; the electric field\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: created by the charged wafer, $E$ ; and particle mechanical mobility, $B$ (terminal velocity per unit external force): $$ \\boldsymbol { j } = c q E B $$ The group qEB is the “electrostatic deposition velocity”, velect $$ \\nu _ { e l e c t } = q E B = j / c $$ The variables $q$ and $E$ are those containing the electrical parameters that affect the magnitude of $\\nu _ { e l e c t }$ ; $B$ depends on particle diameter but not electrical properties. It is the $\\nu _ { e l e c t }$ values that will be calculated for comparison with those of $\\nu _ { d i f f }$ , the particle deposition velocity attributable to particle diffusion. Values of $E$ for which $\\nu _ { e l e c t } < \\nu _ { d i f f }$ will be those deemed tolerable in wafer manufacturing. Note that the total number of particles, $N _ { \\ast }$ , deposited on a wafer, obtained by integrating Equation (1) over the wafer area, $A$ ,\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: and the time of exposure, $t$ , depends on $c$ as well as the deposition velocity: $$ N = c q E B A t o r N / A = c t \\nu _ { e l e c t } $$ Reducing $\\scriptstyle { \\begin{array} { l } { c } \\end{array} }$ obviously reduces $N _ { \\astrosun }$ , but the relative importance of the differing deposition mechanisms and the values of the deposition velocities associated with these mechanisms are assumed to not depend upon $c$ , at least to a first-order approximation (see, for example, Peters and Cooper, 1991). R1-2.2.1 Effect of the Particle Charge, $q$ — There are many charging and discharging mechanisms for particles, so $q$ is hard to predict and likely to be highly variable. In a normal atmosphere the positive and negative air ions tend to have roughly equal effectiveness in charging particles, so that the number of positively charged particles is roughly equal to the number of\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: negatively charged particles. Thus, about half the particles will be attracted and half repelled by a net charge on the wafer. Special circumstances, such as corona discharge ionizers that are not balanced, could alter this conclusion. Without ionizers, cleanrooms tend to have relatively low levels of ions compared to the outdoor or other indoor atmospheres, because the HEPA/ULPA filters efficiently remove ions from the recirculating air. R1-2.2.1.1 A Boltzmann charge equilibrium, the charge distribution approximated by aerosol particles exiting a radioactive neutralizer, is a plausible lower limit for particle charge and will be assumed in the calculations of $\\nu _ { e l e c t } ,$ using an improved version of this distribution developed by Fuchs (1964). Upper limits on particle charge are determined by ion emission limits or, in the case of water droplets, the Rayleigh limit.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: However, assuming higher particle charge distributions usually means that $\\nu _ { e l e c t } > \\nu _ { d i f f }$ for virtually any value of $\\mathrm { ~ ~ { ~ E ~ } ~ } > \\mathrm { ~ \\theta ~ }$ and that the only method for avoiding electrostatically enhanced particle deposition is to reduce wafer charge to zero. Thus, the Fuchs charge distribution will be assumed in calculating $\\nu _ { e l e c t }$ even though it represents the most favorable particle charge distribution for minimizing electrostatically enhanced particle deposition. Under many practical circumstances the particle charge will be greater and the maximum tolerable electrostatic field will be lower than that calculated for the Fuchs charge levels. R1-2.2.2 The Electrostatic Field, E, Induced by the Wafer Surface Charge — The electrostatic field will depend on the charge on the wafer divided by a quantity with the\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: units of length squared; either a distance squared (far from the wafer) or an area (close to the wafer) or some combination at intermediate distances. While field is not properly measured as a voltage, measuring the voltage, $V ,$ at a fixed distance, $s$ , from the wafer allows inferring the field from $V / s$ and the appropriate geometric and dimensional factors. The electrostatic field to be used in Equation (2) can be estimated from the ratio of the wafer charge to the wafer surface area, or the average field near the surface at the center, E0. R1-2.2.2.1 Very far from the wafer, many wafer diameters away, the field created by the net wafer charge, $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ , will be similar to that from a point charge: $$ E _ { 1 } = k _ { 1 } \\ Q / r ^ { 2 } $$ where $k _ { I }$ depends on the system of units used; and $r$ is the distance from the center of the wafer to the particle.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Enhanced Particle Deposition Attributable to Electrical Charge on a Wafer\n\nContent: R1-2.2.2.2 Very close to the wafer, a fraction of a wafer diameter away, the field created by the net wafer charge is: $$ E _ { 2 } = k _ { 2 } \\ Q ^ { \\prime } / r ^ { 2 } $$ where $\\boldsymbol { Q ^ { \\prime } }$ is the net wafer charge, assumed to be uniformly distributed, contained within the intersection of a sphere of radius, $r$ , and centered on the point of the wafer closest to the particle. R1-2.2.2.3 This equation indicates that the charge distribution on the wafer can make a difference close to the wafer.

A conductive wafer will have the charge concentrated near the edges, producing a relatively high field there and much lower fields as the center is approached. R1-2.2.2.5 Note that both $E _ { I }$ and $E _ { 2 }$ are proportional to $\\boldsymbol { \\mathcal { Q } }$ and therefore, other variables being equal, electrostatic deposition is expected to be proportional to $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ . Thus, the criterion to be specified is not the tolerable charge on the wafer but the tolerable electrostatic field near the wafer surface (such as that evaluated at a distance of one radius perpendicular to the wafer surface above its center), $E _ { \\theta }$ . A maximum tolerable value of $E _ { 0 }$ will be estimated by calculating the maximum E0 values for which velect < vdiff, assuming a Fuchs distribution for the particle charge.\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Tolerable Electrostatic Field (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Tolerable Electrostatic Field\n\nContent: R1-2.3.1 Particle Deposition Velocity Attributable to Convective Diffusion (vdiff) — In a microelectronics cleanroom, airflow is generally laminar (“unidirectional”) downward at about $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m / s e c }$ (100 $\\mathrm { f t } / \\mathrm { m i n } \\rangle$ ). If the flow is perpendicular to a surface, such as a wafer of diameter, $D w$ , a boundary layer forms across which particles diffuse to the surface. Liu and Ahn (1987) adapted the correlation of Sparrow and Geiger (1985) and obtained a correlation for the average diffusive deposition velocity as: $$ \\nu _ { \\mathit { d i f f } } = 1 . 0 8 ~ S c ^ { 1 / 3 } R e ^ { 1 / 2 } \\left.

(1996) summarized prior experimental and theoretical work and extended the numerical analysis with a turbulent transport properties model, finding a small increase in deposition for the conditions modeled. These authors’ publications support the approximation that the diffusional deposition velocity is about 0.006 $\\mathrm { c m / s e c }$ at particle diameter of $0 . 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and about 0.03 $\\mathrm { c m / s e c }$ at particle diameter of $0 . 0 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , or: $$ \\nu _ { _ { d i f f } } = ( 0 . 0 3 ~ c m / s e c ) / ( d / 0\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Tolerable Electrostatic Field (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Tolerable Electrostatic Field\n\nContent: . 0 1 \\mu m ) ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ for $0 . 0 1 \\mu m \\leq d \\leq 0 . 3 \\mu m$ in cleanroom air. R1-2.3.2 Particle Deposition Velocity Attributable to Electrostatic Forces $( \\nu _ { e l e c t } )$ — Using a power law to approximate the Fuchs particle charge distribution yields the following approximation for electrical mobility (Cooper et al., 1990): $$ Z = q B = ( 0 . 0 0 2 c m / s ) / ( d / 0 . 0 1 \\mu m ) ( 1 V / c m ) $$ from which the deposition velocity attributable to electrostatic forces becomes: $$ \\nu _ { e l e c t } = ( 0 . 0 0 2 ~ c m / s ) [ E _ { 0 } / ( V / c m ) ] / ( d ~ / 0 . 0 1 ~ \\mu m ) $$ Setting $\\nu _ { e l e c t } / \\nu _ { d i f f } = 1$ results in the following expression for tolerable $E _ { 0 }$ : $$ \\left[ ( E _ { 0 } / ( V / c m ) \\right] = 1 5 \\left[ d / ( 0 . 0 1 \\mu m ) \\right] ^ { \\forall 2 } $$ Table R1-2 lists the values of tolerable electrostatic field adjacent to a wafer surface as calculated\n\nSEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Tolerable Electrostatic Field (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E78-1102 ELECTROSTATIC COMPATIBILITY - GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (ESD) AND ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION (ESA) FOR EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Tolerable Electrostatic Field\n\nContent: from Equation (11). Note that the electrostatic fields are calculated at a distance of one wafer radius from the center of the wafer. $E _ { \\theta }$ is the value of electric field at which electrostatically enhanced particle deposition is estimated to match the particle deposition velocity attributable to diffusion, assuming a Fuchs charge distribution on the particles. This charge distribution represents a minimal particle charge. With most particle charge distributions to be encountered in practice, even lower values of electrostatic fields will produce enhanced deposition. A safe conclusion is that there is no safe value of electrostatic field that will avoid enhanced particle deposition unless neutralization of particle charge has been achieved, in which case the very modest values of electrostatic fields calculated from Equation (11) and tabulated in Table Rl-2 should be tolerable.

In most realistic environments the particle charge will be greater and the tolerable electrostatic field, even lower. Hence the conclusion that in all practical processing environments electrical forces will be the dominant mechanism of particle deposition on wafers.
