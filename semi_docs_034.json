A state model consists of a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transitions’ table. A state model represents the host’s view of the prober, but not necessarily the actual prober operations. All PSEM state model transitions shall be mapped sequentially into the actual equipment events that satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certain implementations, the prober may enter a state and has already satisfied all of the conditions required by the PSEM state model for transition to another state. In this situation, the prober makes the required transition without any additional actions. 5.1.1.1 Various symbols used"

It may also detect faults in processing and recommend an appropriate response to the Process Machine component. An APC component may include statistical process control, modelbased process control, multi-variate analysis, trace analysis, fault pattern matching, or other analysis techniques. 1.2 The Advanced Process Control component specification does not constrain implementation approaches. However, subcomponents are defined to enable integration with different types of analysis and computation mechanisms, specifically those provided in other software systems. The subcomponents are defined principally along boundaries expected to align with products addressing process control in the factory. The number of subcomponents offered by suppliers may vary,"

Harel in Science of Computer Programming 8, 1987. 6.2.2 The Harel convention does not have the concept of state models of “creation” and “extinction” for expressing a temporary entity. The “job” described in this document is such an entity, and a copy of the same state model is used for an independent job newly created. In this document, a circle with a black circle inside is used for expressing extinction of an entity. A filled, black circle denotes the entry to the state model (the entity creation). 6.2.3 Transition tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of each state transition.

If available, this feature shall be fully documented by the supplier (see SEMI E40). 7.4.2 To support a simpler interface for single substrate processing, it is suggested to use the PRJobMultiCreate (see SEMI E40) service. 7.4.3 The use of control jobs restricts some SEMI E40 functionality. In particular, the equipment’s queue management functionality for process jobs is super-seded by the job order as defined in the control job. 7.4.4 The relationship between control jobs and process jobs varies by equipment type. The equipment supplier should document this relationship. In general aborting or stopping a process job does not stop or abort the control job. Equipment is responsible to disposition material correctly depending on how a process job ends. In"
