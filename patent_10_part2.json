If such residues exist between each wiring, the residues function as a leak path and become a cause of short-circuit failure. Therefore, it is required to improve the reliability of the semiconductor device by suppressing the generation of residues on the interlayer insulating film. Other objects and novel features will become apparent from the description of this specification and the accompa- nying drawings.

In addition, the expression “plan view” used in the present application means that the plane formed by the X direction and the Y direction is a “plane” and the “plane” is viewed from the Z direction.\n\nFirst Embodiment\n\n(Structure of Semiconductor Device) The semiconductor device 100 in the first embodiment will be described below using FIGS. 1 to 3. FIG. 1 is a plan view showing a semiconductor chip which is the semicon- ductor device 100. The semiconductor device 100 includes The gate electrode GE1 of the active cell AC is electri- cally connected to the gate wiring GW, and a gate potential is supplied during the operation of the IGBT. The gate electrode GE2 of the inactive cell IAC is electrically con- nected to the emitter electrode EF, and an emitter potential is supplied during the operation of the IGBT. Also, the emitter electrode EE is electrically connected to a base region PB and an emitter region NE of the active cell AC and the base region PB of the inactive cell IAC, and an emitter potential is supplied during the operation of the IGBT. As shown in FIG. 3, the semiconductor device 100 includes an n-type semiconductor substrate SUB having an upper surface and a bottom surface. The semiconductor substrate SUB is made of n-type silicon and has a drift region NV. Here, the n-type semiconductor substrate SUB itself constitute the drift region NV. The semiconductor substrate SUB may be a laminate of an n-type silicon substrate and an n-type silicon layer grown by introducing phosphorus (P) by epitaxial growth on the silicon substrate. In that case, the n-type silicon layer with a lower impurity concentration than the n-type silicon substrate constitutes the drift region NV. On the bottom surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, an n-type field stop region (impurity region) NS is ormed in the semiconductor substrate SUB. The impurity concentration of the field stop region NS is higher than that of the drift region NV. The field stop region NS is provided to prevent the depletion layer extending from the pn junction on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB from reaching the p-type collector region PC during the turn-off of the IGBT. On the bottom surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, a p-type collector region (impurity region) PC is ‘ormed in the semiconductor substrate SUB. The collector region PC is located below the field stop region NS. The floating region PF and the base region PB formed within the floating region PF are not electrically connected to the gate wiring GW and the emitter electrode EE, and are electrically floating. In the active cell AC and the inactive cell IAC, the interlayer insulating film IL is formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB to cover the semicon- ductor elements (IGBT). The interlayer insulating film IL is an impurity-free silicon oxide film, for example, a TEOS (Tetra ethoxy silane) oxide film. A thickness of the interlayer insulating film IL is, for example, 600 nm or more and 1500 nm or less. Also, a first implantation layer IM1 is formed in the interlayer insulating film IL. Below the bottom surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, a collector electrode CE is formed. The collector electrode CE is electrically connected to the collector region C and supplies a collector potential to the collector region PC. The collector electrode CE is a single-layer metal film such as an Au film, Ni film, Ti film or AISi film, or a laminated metal film formed by appropriately laminating these. The field stop region NS, the collector region PC, and the collector electrode CE are formed not only in the cell region 1A but also in the outer peripheral region 2A, etc., over the entire semiconductor substrate SUB. In the semiconductor substrate SUB, the trench TR having a predetermined depth from the upper surface to the bottom surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB is formed. A gate dielectric film GI is formed inside the trench TR. Inside the trench TR via the gate dielectric film GI, the gate electrodes GE1, GE2 are formed. The gate dielectric film GI is, for example, a silicon oxide film. The gate electrodes GE1, GE2 are conductive films, for example, polysilicon films into which n-type impurities have been introduced. On the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB of the active cell AC, a hole barrier region (impurity region) NHB is formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB between. a pair of trenches TR (a pair of gate electrodes GE1). The impurity concentration of the hole barrier region NHB is higher than that of the drift region NV. Ap-type base region (impurity region) PB is formed in the hole barrier region NHB. The n-type emitter region (impu- rity region) NE is formed in the p-type base region PB. The impurity concentration of the emitter region NE is higher than that of the drift region NV. The base region PB is formed to be shallower than a depth of the trench TR, and the emitter region NE is formed to be shallower than a depth of the base region PB. As shown in FIG. 2, a multiple emitter regions NE are formed between the pair of trenches TR (the pair of gate electrodes GE1) and are formed at a predetermined distance from each other along the Y direction. The base region PB located below the emitter region NE adjacent to the gate electrode GE1 is used as a channel region. In the inactive cell IAC, on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, the hole barrier region NHB is formed within the semiconductor substrate SUB between a pair of trenches TR (a pair of gate electrodes GE2). Also, within the semiconductor substrate SUB between the gate electrode GE1 and the gate electrode GE2, a p-type floating region (impurity region) PF is formed. That is, the floating region PF is formed within the semiconductor substrate SUB of the cell region 1A other than between the pair of trenches TR. Within the hole barrier region NHB and the floating region PF, the p-type base region PB is formed. The impurity concentration of the base region PB is higher than that of the floating region PF. The interlayer insulating film IL may be an insulating film having a lower dielectric constant than silicon oxide (SiO). Such a low dielectric constant insulating film is, for example, a silicon oxide film (SiOC film) containing carbon. in the active cell AC, a contact hole CH penetrates the interlayer insulating film IL and the emitter region NE, and reaches inside the base region PB. The contact hole CH is formed to contact the emitter region NE and the base region PB. in the inactive cell IAC, the contact hole CH penetrates the interlayer insulating film IL and reaches inside the base region PB. Also, the contact hole CH is formed to overlap the gate electrode GE2 and the gate dielectric film GI in plan view. Therefore, the contact hole CH in the inactive cell IAC is formed to contact the gate electrode GE2 and the base region PB. in the active cell AC and the inactive cell LAC, a p-type high concentration diffusion region (impurity region) PR is formed in the base region PB around the bottom of the contact hole CH. The impurity concentration of the high concentration diffusion region PR is higher than that of the base region PB. The high concentration diffusion region PR is mainly provided to reduce the contact resistance with a plug PG. Inside the contact hole CH, the plug PG is embedded. The plug PG is made of a conductive film. The conductive film includes, for example, a barrier metal film and a main conductive film formed on the barrier metal film. The barrier metal film is a laminated film of a titanium film and a titanium nitride film formed on the titanium film. The main conductive film is, for example, a tungsten film. Although not shown here, in the outer peripheral region 2A, some of the contact hole CH is also formed on a part of the gate electrode GE1, and the plug PG is formed inside this contact hole CH. The emitter electrode EE is formed on the interlayer insulating film IL. The emitter electrode EE is electrically connected to the emitter region NE, the base region PB, the high concentration diffusion region PR, and the gate elec- trode GE2 through the plug PG, and supplies an emitter potential to these regions. Although not shown here, the gate wiring GW is also formed on the interlayer insulating film IL in the same manufacturing process as the emitter elec- trode EE. The gate wiring GW is electrically connected to the gate electrode GE1 through the plug PG, and supplies a gate potential to the gate electrode GE1. Such the emitter electrode EE and gate wiring GW include the barrier metal film and a main conductive film formed on the barrier metal film. The barrier metal film is, for example, a TiW film. The main conductive film is, for example, an aluminum alloy film to which copper or silicon has been added. (Manufacturing Method of Semiconductor Device) Using FIGS. 4 to 15, I will explain each manu: process included in the manufacturing method of t conductor device 100 in the first embodiment. acturing e semi- Next, the gate dielectric film GI that had been formed outside the trench TR is removed by an etching process using an isotropic etching, an anisotropic etching, or a combination of these. As shown in FIG. 4, prepare the semiconductor substrate SUB having the n-type drift region NV. The semiconductor substrate SUB is made of n-type silicon. As mentioned above, the semiconductor substrate SUB may be a laminate of an n-type silicon substrate and an n-type silicon layer grown by introducing phosphorus (P) by an epitaxial growth method on the silicon substrate. Next, by photolithography technology and ion-implanta- tion method, the n-type hole barrier region NHB is formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB on the upper surface. Then, by photolithography technology and ion-implantation method, the p-type floating region PF is formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB on the upper surface. As shown in FIG. 5, the pair of trenches TR are formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB of the active cell AC and the inactive cell IAC. First, a resist pattern RP1 is formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB. Then, using the resist pattern RPI as a mask, an anisotropic etching is performed on the semiconductor sub- strate SUB. By this process, multiple trenches TR are formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB. The trench TR have a certain depth from the upper surface of the semicon- ductor substrate SUB to the bottom surface of the semicon- ductor substrate SUB. Thereafter, the resist pattern RP1 is removed by an ashing process. As shown in FIG. 8, on the upper surface of the semi- conductor substrate SUB, the p-type base region PB is formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB (floating region PF and hole barrier region NHB) by photolithography technology and ion-implantation method. Next, the n-type emitter region NE is formed in the base region PB by photolithography technology and ion-implantation method. Afterwards, a heat treatment is performed on the semicon- ductor substrate SUB to activate the impurities contained in each impurity region. As aresult, the semiconductor elements (in this case, most of the IGBT) is formed on the semiconductor substrate SUB. As shown in FIG. 9, the interlayer insulating film IL is formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, for example, by the CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposi- tion) method, so as to cover the semiconductor elements. The interlayer insulating film IL is a silicon oxide film that does not contain impurities, for example, a TEOS (Tetra ethoxy silane) oxide film. In the formation by the CVD method, the interlayer insulating film IL is likely to be deposited almost uniformly along the shape of the substrate. Therefore, a concave portion 20 is formed on an upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL directly above the concave portion 10 on the upper surfaces of each of the gate electrodes GE1 and GE2. 30 (Examined Example and its Problems) As shown in FIG. 6, after diffusing the impurities con- tained in the hole barrier region NHB and the floating region PF, the gate dielectric film GI and a conductive film CF1 are ‘ormed inside the trench TR. First, although not shown, a sacrificial oxide film is ‘ormed inside the trench TR and on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB. This removes the damage ayer formed in the semiconductor substrate SUB. The sacrificial oxide film is formed by heat-treating the semi- conductor substrate SUB. This heat treatment is performed, ‘or example, in an atmosphere filled with oxygen gas, at 100 degree Celsius, and under conditions of 30 minutes or more and 60 minutes or less. By this heat treatment, the impurities contained in the hole barrier region NHB and the floating region PF are diffused. Then, the sacrificial oxide film is removed by an isotropic etching using a solution containing, for example, hydrofluoric acid. Next, the gate dielectric film GI is formed inside the trench TR and on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB by a thermal oxidation process. Then, the conductive film CF1 is formed inside the trench TR and on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, for example, by a CVD method, so as to fill the inside of the trench TR through the gate dielectric film GI. The conduc- tive film CF1 is, for example, a polysilicon film into which an n-type impurity has been introduced. As shown in FIG. 7, the gate electrodes GE1 and GE2 are formed inside the trench TR through the gate dielectric film GI The semiconductor device of the examined example stud- ied by the inventors of this application will be described below using FIGS. 33 to 35. FIGS. 33 and 34 show the semiconductor device of Examined Example 1. FIG. 33 is a plan view showing the outer peripheral region 2A of FIG. 1. FIG. 34 is a cross-sectional view taken along line B-B of FIG. 33. The gate electrode GE1 is electrically connected to the gate wiring GW through the contact hole CH. FIG. 35 shows the semiconductor device of Examined Example 2. As will be described later, after the manufacturing process of FIG. 9, the contact hole CH is formed in the interlayer insulating film IL, and a conductive film CF2 is formed inside the contact hole CH and on the interlayer insulating film IL. By removing the conductive film CF2 on the interlayer insulating film IL by polishing with a CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) method, the plug PG is formed inside the contact hole CH. Afterwards, the emitter electrode EE and the gate wiring GW are formed on the interlayer insulating film IL. Here, as shown in FIG. 34, when the concave portion 20 is formed on the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL, there is a possibility that a residue 30 of the conductive film CF2 remains in the concave portion 20 when the conductive film CF2 is removed by polishing. As shown in FIG. 33, if such a residue 30 exists between the wirings, such as between the emitter electrode EE and the gate wiring GW, the residue 30 functions as a leak path and becomes a cause of short-circuit failure. In other words, the reliability of the semiconductor device 100 decreases. First, the conductive film CF1 formed outside the trench TR is removed by the anisotropic etching. The conductive film CF1 formed inside the trench TR remains as the gate electrodes GE1 and GE2. In order to completely remove the conductive film CF1 outside the trench TR, the anisotropic etching is performed by over-etching. Therefore, a concave portion 10 is formed on an upper surface of each of the gate electrodes GE1 and GE2. It is conceivable to extend the polishing time to remove the residue 30 and also to grind the interlayer insulating film IL to a position corresponding to a depth of the concave portion 20. However, generally, in a polishing of the con- ductive film CF2, a polishing rate of the interlayer insulating film IL (silicon oxide film) is lower than that of the con- ductive film CF2. In other words, it is harder to grind the interlayer insulating film IL than the conductive film CF2. Therefore, if the polishing time is extended too much, problems such as an upper surface of the plug PG sinking due to dishing, or the uniformity of the thickness of the interlayer insulating film IL deteriorating due to erosion, occur. In response to such problems, it is conceivable to perform a polishing on the interlayer insulating film IL immediately after forming the interlayer insulating film IL (immediately after FIG. 9) by the CMP method and to flatten the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL. However, gen- erally, the polishing by the CMP method is expensive, and the manufacturing cost increases. this application found that the physical properties of the silicon oxide film change and the polishing rate of the polishing changes. For example, when the ion species is phosphorus (P), the polishing rate becomes higher than that of the non-doped SiO, film. Also, when the ion species is carbon (C), nitrogen (N), silicon (Si), or fluorine (F), the polishing rate becomes lower than that of the non-doped SiO, film. By utilizing these differences in polishing rates, it becomes easier to remove the residue 30 and also to shave the interlayer insulating film IL down to a depth corresponding to the depth of the concave portion 20. Furthermore, in the semiconductor device 100 equipped with an IGBT like the first embodiment, a problem as shown in FIG. 35 occurs when the polishing is performed on the interlayer insulating film IL. As shown in FIG. 35, when the polishing is performed on the interlayer insulating film IL and the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL is flattened, the height H2 from the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL to the gate dielectric film GI in contact with the gate electrode GE2 becomes lower than the height H1 from the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL to the gate electrode GE1. The contact hole CH reaching the gate electrode GE1, the contact hole CH reaching the gate electrode GE2, and the semiconductor substrate SUB are formed by the same manu- facturing process. Therefore, the etching process for forming the contact hole CH is performed to at least a depth corresponding to the height H1. However, on the gate electrode GE2, after the etching process has progressed to a depth corresponding to the height H2, the gate dielectric film GI will be etched. As a result, there is a problem that the gate dielectric film GI in contact with the gate electrode GE2 excessively recedes. Then, there is a risk of short-circuit failure occur- ring because the conductive film CF2 is formed at the location where the gate dielectric film GI has receded, and the gate electrode GE2, the base region PB, and the hole barrier region NHB are electrically connected via the con- ductive film CF2. FIG. 11 shows the manufacturing process following FIG. 9. As shown in FIG. 11, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed in the interlayer insulating film IL by ion-implanta- tion. This ion-implantation is performed using phosphorus (P) as the ion species and under conditions where the dose amount is 1x10'° cm-? or more. Here, the dose amount is 3x10!% cm-?. This ion-implantation is performed by vertical ion-implantation. In other words, this ion-implantation is performed from the direction (Z direction) along the per- pendicular to the upper surface of the semiconductor sub- strate SUB. By this ion-implantation, a laminated film consisting of a bottom interlayer insulating film ILA, the first implantation layer IM1 and an upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is formed. Furthermore, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed so that a thickness of the first implantation layer IM1 is thicker than the depth of the concave portion 20. The thickness of the first implantation layer IM1 is, for example, 15 nm or more and 30 nm or less. In addition, the implantation layer IM1 is formed inside the interlayer insulating film IL so as not to be exposed on the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL. To form such the first implantation layer IM1, the implantation energy of the above-mentioned ion- implantation is, for example, 3 keV or more and 6 keV or less. As shown in FIG. 12, a plurality of holes CH are formed in the laminated film, and the high concentration diffusion region PR is formed in the base region PB. In response to these problems, in the first embodiment, the polishing by the CMP method is not performed immediately after forming the interlayer insulating film IL. Although this makes it difficult to remove the residue 30, in the first embodiment, as a countermeasure, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed in the interlayer insulating film IL by high-concentration ion-implantation. (Formation of Implantation Layer by Jon-Implantation) High-Concentration First, a resist pattern RP2 is formed on the upper inter- layer insulating film IL2. Then, by performing an anisotro- pic etching using the resist pattern RP2 as a mask, a plurality of holes CH are formed in the laminated film so as to reach a position lower than the position of the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate e SUB. Then, by ion-implantation, the p-type high concentration diffusion region PR is formed. in the base region PB at the bottom of each of the plurality of holes CH. Thereafter, the resist pattern RP2 is removed by an ashing process. FIG. 10 is a graph showing data obtained by the inventors of this application through experiments. FIG. 10 shows the relationship between the conditions of ion-implantation for forming the first implantation layer IM1 and a second implantation layer IM2, and a polishing rate of the polishing performed at the time of forming the plug PG. In FIG. 10, the polishing rate of the silicon oxide film (non-doped SiO, film) without ion-implantation is taken as the reference value (1.0). The data shown in FIG. 10 is not a known finding, but a new finding discovered by the inventors of this application. As shown in FIG. 10, ion-implantation is performed on the silicon oxide film using carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phos- phorus (P), silicon (Si), or fluorine (F) as an ion species, and a dose amount of these is set to 1x10!° cm? or more. More specifically, ion-implantation was performed with the dose amount and implantation energy of each ion species as the conditions shown in FIG. 10. As a result, the inventors of The contact hole CH of the active cell AC penetrates the upper interlayer insulating film IL2, the first implantation layer IM1, the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 and the emitter region NE, and reaches inside the base region PB. The contact hole CH of the inactive cell IAC penetrates the upper interlayer insulating film IL2, the first implantation layer IM1, the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1, and reaches inside the gate electrode GE2, the gate dielectric film GI, and the semiconductor substrate SUB (inside the base region PB). In addition, although not shown here, some of the holes CH are formed to penetrate the upper interlayer insulating film IL2, the first implantation layer IM1, the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1, and reach the gate electrode GE1 (see the outer peripheral region 2A in FIG. 33). As shown in FIG. 13, the laminated film is retreated by an isotropic etching using a solution containing, for example, hydrofluoric acid. As a result, not only does the upper surface of the laminated film retreat, but the side surface of the laminated film inside the holes CH also retreat. That is, an opening width of the contact hole CH located above the position of the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB becomes wider than the opening width of the contact hole CH located below the position of the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB. As a result, in the active cell AC, a part of an upper surface of the emitter region NE is exposed, and in the inactive cell IAC, a part of the upper surface of the gate electrode GE2 is exposed. The emitter region NE and the gate electrode GE2 not only contact the plug PG at their side surface, but also contact the plug PG at their upper surface. Therefore, the contact-resistance with the plug PG can be reduced. 30 is surely removed. Also, the first implantation layer IM1 remains in the areas where the shape of the concave portion 20 is reflected. In this way, the residue 30 of the conductive film CF2 can be removed, and the plug PG made of the conductive film CF2 can be formed inside the contact hole CH. By removing the residue 30, the problem that was concerned in the examined example | can be solved. That is, the first implan- tation layer IM1 remains in the part of the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 corresponding to the place where the concave portion 20 was located, but it does not function as a leak path, so it can suppress short defects between each wiring such as between the emitter electrode EE and the gate wiring GW. Therefore, the reliability of the semiconductor device 100 can be improved. Note that by this isotropic etching, the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 that had been formed on the first implan- tation layer IM1 is removed. At this time, it is preferable that the first implantation layer IM1 is exposed. As shown in FIG. 14, the conductive film CF2 is formed on the first implantation layer IM1 to fill the inside of the holes CH. First, the barrier metal film is formed inside the holes CH and on the first implantation layer IM1. For example, a titanium film can be formed inside the holes CH and on the first implantation layer IM1 by sputtering, and a titanium nitride film can be formed on the titanium film by sputtering to form the barrier metal film. Then, for example, by CVD, a main conductive film made of, for example, tungsten is formed on the barrier metal film so as to fill the inside of the holes CH. This laminated film including the barrier metal film and the main conductive film constitute the conductive film CF2. As shown in FIG. 15, the conductive film CF2 outside the holes CH is removed by polishing by CMP so that the conductive film CF2 inside the holes CH remains. Note that this polishing is performed under conditions where the conductive film CF2 and the first implantation layer IM1 are more easily polished compared to the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1. At the point when the polishing reaches the first implan- tation layer IM1, residue 30 exists in the areas where the shape of the concave portion 20 is reflected. Therefore, in order to remove the residue 30, the time of the polishing is extended, and the polishing is also performed on the first implantation layer IM1. Also, since the polishing rate of the first implantation layer IM1 is high, the residue 30 and the first implantation layer IM1 can be removed in a relatively short time. There- fore, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of dishing or erosion. Also, since the polishing by the CMP method is not performed on the interlayer insulating film IL immediately after forming the interlayer insulating film IL G@mmediately after FIG. 9), it is possible to suppress the increase in manufacturing cost. Also, it can solve the problem that the gate dielectric film GI in contact with the gate electrode GE2 excessively recedes, as was concerned in the examined example 2. After that, the structure of FIG. 3 is obtained through the following manufacturing process. First, a TiW film is formed on the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 by, for example, a sputtering method, and an aluminum alloy film is formed on the TiW film by, for example, a sputtering method. Then, by patterning the TiW film and the aluminum alloy film by photolithography technology and dry etching process, the emitter electrode EE is formed. Note that the gate wiring GW is also formed on the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 in the same process as the process of forming the emitter electrode EE. Next, by performing ion-implantation from the bottom surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB, the n-type field stop region NS and a p-type collector region PC are formed. Then, a metal film such as an Au film, Ni film, Ti film or AISi film is formed under the bottom surface of the semiconduc- tor substrate SUB by, for example, a sputtering method. This metal film becomes the collector electrode CE. The collector electrode CE may be a laminated film obtained by appro- priately laminating the above-mentioned metal film. As mentioned above, in this polishing, the polishing rate of the first implantation layer IM1 is different from the polishing rate of the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1, and is higher than the polishing rate of the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1. In other words, the first implantation layer IM1 is easily abraded. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 16, in this polishing, the first implantation layer IM1 is polished, but the residue 30 and the first implantation layer IM1 can be removed in a rela- tively short time. At this time, the bottom interlayer insu- ating film IL1 has a relatively low polishing rate, so this bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 functions as a polishing stopper. Therefore, it becomes easy to detect the end point of the polishing. In addition, since the first implantation layer IM1 was ormed so that the thickness of the first implantation layer M1 is thicker than the depth of the concave portion 20, when the first implantation layer IM1 is removed and the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 is exposed, the residue\n\nFirst Modified Example\n\nHereinafter, a semiconductor device 100 in the first modi- fied example of the first embodiment will be described using FIG. 17. in the manufacturing process of FIG. 11, the ion-implan- tation of the first implantation layer IM1 was performed by vertical ion-implantation, but in the first modified example, the ion-implantation of the first implantation layer IM1 is performed by oblique ion-implantation. FIG. 17 shows a manufacturing process performed instead of the manufacturing process of FIG. 11. As shown in FIG. 17, the ion-implantation of the first implantation layer IM1 is performed at an angle inclined from the perpendicular to the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate SUB. Such an angle is, for example, 20 degrees or more and 40 degrees or less. Note that other conditions related to the ion-implantation of the first implantation layer IM1 are the same as in the first embodiment. In the case of oblique ion-implantation in the first modi- fied example, compared to the vertical ion-implantation in the first embodiment, the first implantation layer IM1 is more likely to be formed deeply and widely at locations where steps such as the concave portion 20 occur. Therefore, it becomes easier to improve the flatness of the entire interlayer insulating film IL in the polishing. Note that the oblique ion-implantation of the first modi- fied example can be applied not only to the first embodiment but also to the second, third, and fourth embodiments described later. That is, the oblique ion-implantation of the first modified example can be applied not only to the ion-implantation of the first implantation layer IM1 but also to the ion-implantation of the second implantation layer IM2 described later. of a contact hole CH. The manufacturing process for form- ing the conductive film CF2 is the same as in the first embodiment. As shown in FIG. 21, the conductive film CF2 inside the contact hole CH is left by removing the conductive film CF2 located outside the contact hole CH through a polishing using a CMP method. This polishing is performed under conditions where the conductive film CF2 and the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 are easier to polish compared to the second implantation layer IM2. At the point when the polishing reaches the upper inter- layer insulating film IL2, there is a residue 30 in the area reflecting the shape of a concave portion 20. Therefore, to remove the residue 30, the time of the polishing is extended, and the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is also polished.\n\nSecond Embodiment\n\nHereinafter, a semiconductor device 100 in the second embodiment will be described using FIGS. 18 to 21. Note that, in the following description, differences from the first embodiment will be mainly described, and the description of overlapping points with the first embodiment will be omit- ted. In the first embodiment, the first implantation layer IM1 was formed using phosphorus (P). In the second embodi- ment, a second implantation layer IM2 is formed using carbon (C). As shown in FIG. 10, when ion-implantation is performed under conditions where carbon (C) is used as an ion species and a dose amount is 1x10'° cm™? or more, a polishing rate becomes lower than that of the non-doped SiO, film. As described above, in this polishing, a polishing rate of the second implantation layer IM2 is different from a pol- ishing rate of the upper interlayer insulating film IL2, and is lower than the polishing rate of the upper interlayer insu- lating film IL2. In other words, the upper interlayer insulat- ing film IL2 is easy to scrape off, but the second implantation layer IM2 is hard to scrape off. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 22, in this polishing, the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is polished, but the residue 30 and the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 can be removed in a relatively short time. At this time, the second implantation layer IM2 functions as a polishing stopper. Therefore, it becomes easy to detect the end point of the polishing. Also, the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 remains in the area reflecting the shape of the concave portion 20. FIG. 18 shows a manufacturing process following FIG. 9. As shown in FIG. 18, by ion-implantation, the second implantation layer IM2 is formed in the interlayer insulating film IL. This ion-implantation is performed using carbon (C) as the ion species and under conditions where the dose amount is 1x10'° cm”? or more. Here, the dose amount is 3x10'° cm™?. Note that this ion-implantation is performed by vertical ion-implantation. By this ion-implantation, a laminated film consisting of a bottom interlayer insulating film IL1, the second implantation layer IM2 and an upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is formed. A thickness of the second implantation layer IM2 is, for example, 5 nm or more and 20 nm or less. Furthermore, the second implantation layer IM2 is formed inside the inter- layer insulating film IL so as not to be exposed on an upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL. Note that the second implantation layer IM2 is formed at a deeper position than the first implantation layer IM1 of the first embodiment. To form such the second implantation layer IM2, the implan- tation energy of the above-mentioned ion-implantation is, ‘or example, 2 keV or more and 8 keV or less. As shown in FIG. 19, first, a plurality of holes CH are ‘ormed in the laminated film. Then, a p-type high concen- tration diffusion region PR is formed at the bottom of each of the plurality of holes CH. The manufacturing process for orming each of the plurality of holes CH and the high concentration diffusion region PR is the same as in the first embodiment. Next, as in the first embodiment, the laminated film is retreated by an isotropic etching using a solution containing, or example, hydrofluoric acid. By this isotropic etching, the upper interlayer insulating: film IL2 becomes thin, but the second implantation layer IM2 does not expose. As shown in FIG. 20, a conductive film CF2 is formed on the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 so as to fill the inside In this way, it is possible to remove the residue 30 of the conductive film CF2 and form a plug PG made of the conductive film CF2 inside the contact hole CH. Therefore, the same effect as in the first embodiment can be obtained in the second embodiment as well. Also, by applying the second implantation layer IM2, regardless of a thickness of the interlayer insulating film IL at the time of deposition, the distance from an upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL after the polishing to an upper surface of a semiconductor substrate SUB can be kept constant. For example, if the interlayer insulating film IL is formed thicker than usual, the implantation energy of the ion-implantation of the second implantation layer IM2 is made larger than usual, and the second implantation layer IM2 is formed at a deep position. In the polishing, the interlayer insulating film IL located above the second implantation layer IM2 is polished, and the second implan- tation layer IM2 functions as the polishing stopper. There- fore, regardless of the thickness of the interlayer insulating film IL at the time of deposition, a total thickness of the second implantation layer IM2 and the interlayer insulating film IL located below the second implantation layer IM2 is always constant. In this way, by applying the second implan- tation layer IM2, a thickness of the entire interlayer insu- lating film IL after the polishing can be stabilized. Afterwards, similar to the first embodiment, an emitter electrode EE, a gate wiring GW, a field stop region NS, a p-type collector region PC and a collector electrode CE are formed. As shown in FIG. 10, even when nitrogen (N), silicon (Si) or fluorine (F) is used as the ion species instead of carbon (C), a second implantation layer IM2 with a low polishing rate can be formed. However, since the lower polishing rate can produce a higher effect, it is most preferable to use carbon (C) for forming the second implantation layer IM2. process for forming each of the plurality of holes CH and the high concentration diffusion region PR is the same as in the first embodiment.\n\nThird Embodiment\n\nThe semiconductor device 100 in the third embodiment will be described below using FIGS. 23 to 26. Note that, in the following description, differences from the first embodi- ment will be mainly described, and the description of overlapping points with the first embodiment will be omit- ted. Next, as in the first embodiment, the laminated film is retreated by an isotropic etching using a solution containing, for example, hydrofluoric acid. By this isotropic etching, the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 that had been formed on the first implantation layer IM1 is removed. At this time, it is preferable that the first implantation layer IM1 is exposed, but it is acceptable if a small amount of the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 remains. In the first embodiment, the first implantation layer IM1 was formed after forming the interlayer insulating film IL. In the third embodiment, the formation of the interlayer insu- lating film IL is divided into two times, and the first implantation layer IM1 is formed in between. in order not to remove the first implantation layer IM1 during the isotropic etching, it is preferable that a thickness of the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is thicker than the amount of retreat of the laminated film due to the isotropic etching. FIG. 23 shows a manufacturing process following FIG. 8. As shown in FIG. 23, a bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 is formed on the upper surface of a semiconductor substrate SUB, for example, by a CVD method, so as to cover semiconductor element. The bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 is a silicon oxide film that does not contain impurities, for example, a TEOS oxide film. Above a con- cave portion 10 on upper surfaces of each of gate electrodes GE1 and GE2, a concave portion 20 is formed on an upper surface of the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1. The subsequent manufacturing process is the same as that FIG. 14 and later in the first embodiment. of Note that, in the third embodiment, the second implanta- tion layer IM2 of the second embodiment may be applied instead of the first implantation layer IM1. In that case, in order not to expose the second implantation layer IM2 during the isotropic etching, the thickness of the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is made thicker than in the third embodiment. As shown in FIG. 24, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed in the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 by ion-implantation. This ion-implantation is performed using phosphorus (P) as an ion species, and under conditions where a dose amount is 1x10'° em-? or more. Here, the dose amount is 3x10'° cm7?. Note that this ion-implantation is performed by vertical ion-implantation. The first implantation layer IM1 in the third embodiment is formed on an upper surface of the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1. In order to form such the first implan- tation layer IM1, the injection energy of the above ion- implantation is, for example, 1 keV or more and 2 keV or less. In the first embodiment, it was necessary to increase the injection energy to some extent in order to form the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 inside the interlayer insulating film IL. Therefore, the concentration profile of the first implantation layer IM1 tends to be wide and gentle. In the third embodiment, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed on the upper surface of the bottom interlayer insulating film IL1 by low injection energy, so the concentration profile of the first implantation layer IM1 becomes narrow and steep. Therefore, a higher density implantation layer IM1 can be formed. That is, in the third embodiment, compared to the first embodiment, it becomes easier to polish the first implantation layer IM1 during polishing treatment. As shown in FIG. 25, an upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is formed on an upper surface of the first implantation layer IM1, for example, by a CVD method. The upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is a silicon oxide film that does not contain impurities, for example, a TEOS oxide film. Above the concave portion 10 on the upper surface of each of the gate electrodes GEL and GE2, the concave portion 20 is formed on the upper surface of the upper interlayer insulating film IL2. As shown in FIG, 26, first, a plurality of holes CH are formed in a laminated film consisting of a bottom interlayer insulating film IL1, the second implantation layer IM2 and an upper interlayer insulating film IL2. Next, the p-type high concentration diffusion region PR is formed at the bottom of each of the plurality of holes CH. The manufacturing\n\nFourth Embodiment\n\nThe semiconductor device 100 in the fourth embodiment will be described below using FIGS. 27 to 30. Note that, in the following description, differences from the first embodiment will be mainly described, and the descrip- tion of overlapping points with the first embodiment will be omitted. in the fourth embodiment, not only the first implantation layer IM1 of the first embodiment but also the second implantation layer IM2 of the second embodiment are formed below the first implantation layer IM1 in the inter- layer insulating film IL. FIG. 27 shows a manufacturing process following FIG. 9. As shown in FIG, 27, the first implantation layer IM1 and. the second implantation layer IM2 are formed in the inter- layer insulating film IL by ion-implantation. The manufac- turing process for forming each of the first implantation layer IM1 and the second implantation layer IM2 is the same as in the first embodiment. The first implantation layer IM1 and the second implan- tation layer IM2 are formed inside the interlayer insulating film IL so as not to be exposed on an upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL. Note that it does not matter which is formed first, the formation of the first implantation layer IM1 or the formation of the second implantation layer IM2. By this ion-implantation, a laminated film consisting of a bottom interlayer insulating film IL1, the second implan- tation layer IM2, the first implantation layer IM1 and an upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is formed. As shown in FIG. 28, first, multiple holes CH are formed in the laminated film. Next, a p-type high concentration diffusion region PR is formed at the bottom of each of the multiple holes CH. The manufacturing process for forming each of the multiple holes CH and the high concentration diffusion regions PR is the same as in the first embodiment. Next, as in the first embodiment, the laminated film is retreated by an isotropic etching using a solution containing, for example, hydrofluoric acid. By this isotropic etching, the upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is removed. At this time, it is preferable that the first implantation layer IM1 is exposed. embodiment. Next, as in the first embodiment, the interlayer insulating film IL is retreated by an isotropic etching using a solution containing, for example, hydrofluoric acid. As shown in FIG. 29, a conductive film CF2 is formed on the first implantation layer IM1 to fill the inside of a contact hole CH. The manufacturing process for forming the con- ductive film CF2 is the same as in the first embodiment. As shown in FIG. 30, the conductive film CF2 located outside the contact hole CH is removed by a polishing using a CMP method, leaving the conductive film CF2 inside the contact hole CH. Note that this polishing is performed under conditions where the conductive film CF2 and the first implantation layer IM1 are more easily polished compared to the second implantation layer IM2. When the polishing reaches the first implantation layer IM1, a residue 30 is present at the location reflecting the shape of a concave portion 20. Therefore, to remove the residue 30, the polishing time is extended and the first implantation layer IM1 is also polished. As described above, in this polishing, a polishing rate of the second implantation layer IM2 is different from a pol- ishing rate of the first implantation layer IM1 and the upper interlayer insulating film IL2, and is lower. In other words, the first implantation layer IM1 located on the second implantation layer IM2 is easily polished, but the second implantation layer IM2 is difficult to polish. Therefore, in this polishing, although the first implanta- tion layer IM1 is polished, the residue 30 and the implan- tation layer IM1 can be removed in a relatively short time. At this time, the second implantation layer IM2 functions as a polishing stopper. Also, the first implantation layer IM1 remains at the location reflecting the shape of the concave portion 20. In the fourth embodiment, since the second implantation layer IM2, which has a lower polishing rate than the first implantation layer IM1 and upper interlayer insulating film IL2 is formed, the polishing can be performed with a higher selectivity ratio, and it becomes easier to detect the end point of the polishing. As shown in FIG. 32, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed in the interlayer insulating film IL by ion-implanta- tion. This ion-implantation is performed using phosphorus (P) as an ion species, and under conditions where a dose amount is 1x10'° cm-? or more. Here, the dose amount is 3x10'° cm™. In the fifth embodiment, this ion-implantation is per- formed by oblique ion-implantation. That is, the ion-implan- tation of the first implantation layer IM1 is performed at an angle inclined from the perpendicular to an upper surface of a semiconductor substrate SUB. Such an angle is, for example, 20 degrees or more and 40 degrees or less. By applying oblique ion-implantation, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed on the side surface of the interlayer insulating film IL located near the upper part of a contact hole CH, but ions are not implanted near the bottom of the contact hole CH. The first implantation layer IM1 in the fifth embodiment is formed on an upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL. To form such the first implantation layer IM1, the injection energy of the above ion-implantation is, for example, 1 keV or more and 2 keV or less. In the fifth embodiment, as in the third embodiment, the first implantation layer IM1 is formed on the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL by low injection energy, so the concentration profile of the first implantation layer IM1 becomes narrower and steeper. Therefore, a higher density implantation layer IM1 can be formed. That is, in the fifth embodiment, compared to the first embodiment, it becomes easier to polish the first implantation layer IM1 during the polishing. The subsequent manufacturing process is the same as that after FIG. 14 of the first embodiment. Afterwards, as in the first embodiment, an emitter elec- trode EF, a gate wiring GW, a field stop region NS, a p-type collector region PC, and a collector electrode CE are formed. Note that the technology of the fourth embodiment may be applied to the third embodiment. In that case, the second implantation layer IM2 is formed below the first implanta- tion layer IM1.\n\nFifth Embodiment\n\nIn the fifth embodiment, the second implantation layer IM2 of the second embodiment may be applied instead 0: the first implantation layer IM1. In that case, to prevent the second implantation layer IM2 from being exposed on an upper surface of the interlayer insulating film IL, the second implantation layer IM2 is formed at a deep position by oblique ion-implantation. Also, the technology of the fifth embodiment may be applied to the fourth embodiment. In that case, the secon implantation layer IM2 is formed below the first implanta- tion layer IM1 by oblique ion-implantation. Hereinafter, a semiconductor device 100 in the fifth embodiment will be described using FIGS. 31 and 32. Note that, in the following description, differences from the first embodiment will be mainly described, and the description of overlapping points with the first embodiment will be omit- ted. In the first embodiment, the first implantation layer IM1 was formed after forming multiple holes CH. In the fifth embodiment, the implantation layer IM1 is formed by oblique ion-implantation after forming multiple holes CH. FIG. 31 shows a manufacturing process following FIG. 9. As shown in FIG. 31, first, multiple holes CH are formed in an interlayer insulating film IL. Next, a p-type high concen- tration diffusion region PR is formed at the bottom of each of the multiple holes CH. The manufacturing process for forming each of the multiple holes CH and the high con- centration diffusion region PR is the same as in the first Although the present invention has been described based on the above embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and can be variously modified without departing from the spirit thereof.
