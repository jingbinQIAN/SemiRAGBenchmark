The present invention can effectively improve the conversion efficiency of solar cells.\n\nTechnical Field\n\nThe present invention relates to the field of solar cell technology, specifically a high conversion rate solar cell and its manufacturing process. Solar cells are devices that convert solar light into electrical energy using light energy. They are typically assembled from thin layers of semiconductor materials like silicon (Si). Solar cells are a clean, renewable energy source that does not emit harmful substances or cause environmental pollution. The working principle of solar cells is based on the photovoltaic effect. When sunlight hits the cell, photons excite electrons in the semiconductor, creating charge separation and generating an electric current. This current can be connected to an external load for power supply. Common solar cell materials include monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and flexible organic materials. Currently, the conversion efficiency of solar cells made from silicon crystals is limited by the material's spectral absorption capacity and losses due to reflection from the flat silicon surface. This limitation prevents solar cells from converting 100% of light energy into electrical output, impeding efficiency improvement. Hence, we propose a high conversion rate solar cell and its manufacturing process.\n\nContent of the Invention\n\nThe purpose of the present invention is to provide a high conversion rate solar cell and its manufacturing process to address the problems mentioned in the background. To achieve this purpose, the invention provides the following technical solution: LUS506218 a high conversion rate solar cell and its manufacturing process, including an aluminum back layer, a bottom electrode layer, a P-type polycrystalline silicon layer, an N-type polycrystalline silicon layer, and a perovskite structure.

The P-type polycrystalline silicon layer is above the bottom electrode layer, with the N-type polycrystalline silicon layer above it. Above the N-type polycrystalline silicon layer is the top electrode layer, with main electrodes and gate electrodes on its surface. The perovskite structure is positioned between the N-type polycrystalline silicon layer and the top electrode layer. Above the top electrode layer is a glass cover plate, and an aluminum alloy frame is set on the outside of the aluminum back layer. Preferably, a passivation layer is set on the upper surface of the bottom electrode layer, and this passivation layer is a transparent conductive oxide film to reduce surface reflection losses and improve solar absorption efficiency. Preferably, the perovskite structure includes a perovskite light-absorbing layer and a hole transport layer. The perovskite light-absorbing layer, positioned above the N-type polycrystalline silicon layer, serves as a light-absorbing material with excellent photovoltaic performance. Its internal lattice structure effectively captures and conducts light energy, fully utilizing sunlight and increasing the cell's conversion efficiency. Additionally, perovskite materials have a wide light-absorbing range, including visible and infrared light, enabling efficient power generation under low-light conditions. Preferably, the hole transport layer is placed above the perovskite light-absorbing layer, facilitating the reception of holes from the perovskite light-absorbing layer and their transmission to the top electrode layer. It has excellent hole transport properties and light stability, aiding in the collection efficiency and transmission speed of holes. Preferably, an anti-reflective layer is set on the upper surface of the top electrode layer, and this anti-reflective layer is a silicon nitride anti-reflective film to reduce surface reflection losses and improve solar absorption efficiency. Preferably, the glass cover plate is made of white glass with high light transmittance. Preferably, an EVA film is set on the lower surface of the glass cover plate for easy adhesion to the glass cover. The manufacturing process for a high conversion rate solar cell includes the following steps: Initially, before starting polysilicon deposition, hydrogen gas is introduced into the reduction furnace for in situ etching of the silicon core surface to remove the oxide layer. Then, a mixture of hydrogen and chlorinated gas is introduced into the furnace to react with trace Group III-V impurities adsorbed on the equipment surface, forming volatile chlorides. These chlorides, along with hydrogen, enter the tail gas treatment unit, completing online purification of the equipment. This method is not only simple but also removes impurities adsorbed on the surface of the silicon core and the internal cavity of the reduction furnace and its accessory equipment. This effectively resolves the risk of incidental contamination during furnace opening, significantly reducing the quality of silicon material. The concentration of Group III-V impurities near the silicon core is reduced to the same level as that far from the core, specifically evaluating the concentration of impurities based on phosphorus content.
