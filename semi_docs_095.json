The interior of the canister should be resistant to corrosion by the reagents being tested. This canister is fitted with a relief valve set at 3.5 bar (50 psi), a nitrogen inlet, and a sealed feed-through for the sample tube. The reagent container is fitted with a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) cap to which is attached a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nitrogen inlet filter. This permits the nitrogen pressures inside and outside the reagent container to equilibrate when the vessel is pressurized and prevents particles from the pressure canister from entering the sample reagent container. 7.14.2.2 Either of two sample and dip tube configurations may be used.

The optical properties of naturally occurring particles in liquid reagents are different from the optical properties of PSL and water. OPCs detect “light-scattering centers” and calculate particle size and concentration based on the assumption that the light-scattering centers are equivalent to PSL in water. In reality, light scattered by a particle is dependent upon particle size, particle shape and the difference between the particle’s refractive index and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. When properly calibrated OPCs from different manufacturers are used to measure particles in high purity water, they give comparable size and concentration data. 7.14.3.1.1 Commercially, OPCs are manufactured with different illuminating"

Because of the significant difference in the refractive index of particles relative to the refractive index of water, the resulting scattered light profile is readily detected by all OPCs. Hence there is relatively good comparative agreement between OPCs when used to detect particles in high purity water. 7.14.3.1.2 When calibrated OPCs are used to measure particles in semiconductor liquid reagents, a totally different situation is encountered. The refractive index of liquid reagents varies significantly from water and is, in general, greater than water. While the refractive index of reagents is known and can be adjusted for, the refractive index of particles is unknown and, in many circumstances, is expected to be very close to the refractive index of reagents. Particles therefore have a tendency to become invisible to an OPC. The degree of invisibility will depend on the optical arrangement of each OPC. A study carried out in $1 9 9"

Chemical-to-chemical comparison indicated that there was no sensor that consistently reported higher or lower concentrations than other sensors. 7.14.3.2 Using OPCs in Semiconductor Liquid Reagents — OPCs have a critical role to play in monitoring particles in liquid reagents. OPCs can detect low concentrations of small particles in real-time and can be easily calibrated using PSL beads. However, the current state of OPC technology limits their use to claim that a liquid reagent meets a standard particle concentration at a particular particle size. 7.14.3.2.1 When a supplier of a liquid reagent uses an OPC to specify that reagent’s particle concentration, for example on a Certificate of Analysis, the make and model of OPC must also be specified. If the customer of the liquid reagents wishes to check whether the incoming reagent meets the claimed level of cleanliness, the customer must use an OPC of the same make and model number."

In both procedures, a needle valve, downstream of the counter, is used to control the flow rate. In the discrete procedure, a measured volume of fluid is counted and collected in a graduated container. Automatic level detection may be used to start and stop the counter.

No general operating conditions are given here since these will vary with the instrument type and design; consequently, the manufacturers manual should be followed. 6.2.2 Standard and Sample Preparation — With certain methods, the achievable MDL can be improved by preconcentration. Some methods require matrix dilution to run some analyses and may also affect the MDL. 6.2.3 Calibration — Calibrate the instrument for all specified trace contaminants using measurement and preparation protocols identical to those used in sample preparation and measurement, wherever appropriate. The calibration data structure used to determine the MDL should be as close to identical as possible to the data structure normally used for calibration in the laboratory. Minimum data requirements should be determinations at, at least, two concentration levels (standards), each independently sampled 3 times. The lowest concentration standard should be at, or"

    "content": "6.3.1  The MDL is calculated by using the results from a regression analysis of the calibration data to obtain a 3 sigma equivalent (in probability) upper confidence limit of individual measurements. Two alternative computational methods are provided for linear calibration models. One provides the MDL based on an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis; the other on a weighted least squares (WLS) based regression analysis. These two computational alternatives do not provide the same MDL. The OLS algorithm is appropriate when signal uncertainty remains relatively constant over the window of calibration; otherwise, the WLS algorithm is more appropriate. A third alternative allows the use of similar regression-based approaches for MDL determination in the presence of a more complex calibration model (e.g., nonlinear, multivariate), or when distributional assumptions of the other alternatives are not appropriate. Many software packages perform regression analysis, and their use is recommended."
