The measured point shall be measured in the air.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.1  Measurement of Electrical Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.1  Measurement of Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: 9.1.1 Measurement of Stable Discharge Voltage — Apply zero or very low voltage to the both ends of a lamp (between two electrodes) and increase the voltage gradually (slide-up). The lamp starts to discharge after the voltage reaches a certain value. Furthermore, increase the voltage gradually (slide-up) and measure the potential difference between the lamp ends (electrodes) as a stable discharge voltage when a main discharge starts. 9.1.2 Measurement of Lamp Current — Adjust the output voltage of power supply unit to gain a specified lamp current. Measure the lamp current at GND terminal when it becomes stable at a specified value. Record the preset voltage of the power supply as well. (Refer to Figure 1 or Figure 2.) 9.1.3 Measurement of Lamp Voltage — Measure the potential difference between both ends (electrodes) of a lamp as a lamp voltage when the lamp current becomes stable at a specified lamp current. If the lamp current is affected when a probe is connected,\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.1  Measurement of Electrical Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.1  Measurement of Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: adjust the lamp current to make it a specified lamp current. Measure the lamp current after it becomes stable. 9.1.4 Lamp Wattage — It is defined as a product of lamp current, lamp voltage and power factor $( \\mathrm { W } = \\mathrm { V } \\mathrm { L } \\times \\mathrm { I L } \\times \\mathrm { c o s } \\theta )$ ) and expressed as a reference value. When the phase difference between the lamp current and lamp voltage can be ignored and if such situation is specified, the product of the lamp current and lamp voltage $( \\mathrm { W } = \\mathrm { V } \\mathrm { L } \\times \\mathrm { I } \\mathrm { L }$ ) may be expressed as a reference value.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics\n\nContent: 9.2.1 Point of Measurement — The point is the side surface of a lamp, which is within the range of viewing angle (black circle) of a measuring instrument. The area of measurement is the central part of the lamp. The point of measurement shall be so small relatively to the inner diameter of the lamp that the dislocation of the point may not vary the luminance and chromaticity. The point of measurement is a cylindrical surface but it could be regarded as a plain surface due to the smallness. (See Figure 5.) The dispersion due to dislocation of a point of measurement is smaller within the range that is less than or equal to $50 \\%$ of the inner diameter. The luminance decreases in the other range. 9.2.2 Distance of Measurement — The distance shall be from a lamp surface to be measured to a lightreceiving lens surface of a measuring instrument. The size of viewing angle varies according to adjustment by luminance meter and the distance of measurement, set the distance to\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics\n\nContent: match the inner diameter mentioned above. When measuring, the inner surface of the lamp and the focal point shall be well matched (Figure 5). (If the focal point of the luminance meter is displaced, the luminance and chromaticity values will not be indicated correctly.) 9.2.3 Timing of Measurement — Measure after the luminance seems stable at a specified lamp current (where the luminance fluctuation difference is within $\\pm 3 \\%$ of the stable luminance, for example). (See Figure 4.) Commentary on Figure 4: The CCFL luminance has a special rising property. The highest luminance and stable luminance vary by the combination of ambient temperature and lamp current and the transitions vary as well. This is based upon the fact that the CCFL luminance depends on temperature and the generated heat by lighting affects it. For this reason, the luminance varies until the lamp wall temperature becomes stable. Before the measurement, grasp the special rising property of luminance\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics\n\nContent: and set the timing of measurement of the stable luminance. 9.2.4 Measurement of Luminance — Set a spectroradiometer or a colorimeter vertical to a side to be measured and measure according to the above-mentioned instruction of measurement. Avoid shades of mercury particles in the lamp. (See Figure 5.) 9.2.5 Measurement of Chromaticity — Measure in the same manner and at the same time of the measurement of luminance. 9.3 Measurement of Effective Length of Luminous Part — Measure when the luminance is fully stable at a specified lamp current according to the measuring conditions mentioned above. The luminance varies greatly around electrodes since the temperature variation is big among points of measurement due to high temperature of a lamp wall. Sufficient aging shall be performed before measurement to avoid impacts of the change of passage of time to each point to be measured. Fix the lamp and move the spectroradiometer or the colorimeter for better measurement since the\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 9.2  Measurement of Optical Characteristics\n\nContent: lamp wall temperature does not vary and so the luminance becomes stable in this way. (See Figure 6.) 9.4 Measurement of Luminance Stabilization Time — Use a CCFL in which the wall temperature and ambient temperature are kept in equilibrium before lighting. From just after a CCFL is turned on by specified lamp current, measure the luminance changes until it seems stable (where the luminance fluctuation difference is within $\\pm 3 \\%$ of the stable luminance, for example).\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 10  Reporting Results\n\n10.1  Report the following items:  \n10.1.1  report date,  \n10.1.2  test date,  \n10.1.3  measuring equipment types, and conditions of use (lighting frequency, rated length of connecting wire, distance of measurement, viewing angle, etc.),  \n10.1.4  conditions of test specimen (size, other specifications, etc.),  \n10.1.5  to specify item names and necessary entries for the CCFL outer and inner diameters, lamp length and necessary specifications,  \n10.1.6  conditions of measurement (ambient temperature, aging time, etc.),  \n10.1.7  measurement results (electrical and optical characteristics), and  \n10.1.8  remarks (other notes).\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 11  Related Documents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # 11  Related Documents\n\nContent: Related Information 1: documents regarding main discharge, Related Information 2: dark characteristics, and Related Information 3: precautions for measuring method (leakage current, lamp wall temperature, temperature slide-up speed for master CCFL, etc.).

R1-1.2 When the secondary voltage of inverter is stepping up from a sufficiently low voltage gradually, an emission area appears near the electrode connected to higher voltage side. (See Figure R1-1 $1 ^ { \\mathrm { s t } }$ Phase). This means that the discharge starts between the electrode and ground level of discharge circuit through the stray capacitance, and a spark after dark current takes place in the discharge space in the tube. In the discharge, the other electrode is the tube wall (glass or fluorescent substance); the formation of dielectric barrier discharge and the existence of the secondary electron supply system to the discharge space can be considered and thus the\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-1  Phenomenon of CCFL Discharge Starting (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-1  Phenomenon of CCFL Discharge Starting\n\nContent: discharge seems sustainable. Therefore, the emission around the electrode is judged to be the emission mainly by negative glow of glow discharge.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable Lighting Mode (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable Lighting Mode\n\nContent: R1-2.1 After the discharge takes place near the electrode and the secondary voltage of the inverter increases gradually, the emission area near the electrode grows longer accordingly. (See Figure R1- 2.) This means that a positive column is generated by applied voltage to have such the length as corresponds to the value of resistance based on the applied voltage. When the voltage is applied furthermore, the emission area (i.e. positive column) between two electrodes is generated finally. (See Figure R1-3 $2 ^ { \\mathrm { n d } }$ Phase.) However, if the tube is thin and long and the stray capacitance is relatively greater to the discharge circuit, the ratio of current that flows through the stray capacitance is still large at this phase. With the increase of the inverter secondary voltage, the ratio of current that flows in the tube also increases and most of the current flows in the tube because the impedance of discharge path decreases on the contrary due to\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable Lighting Mode (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable Lighting Mode\n\nContent: negative characteristics of discharge. (See Figure R1-4 3rd Phase.) R1-2.2 Each voltage applied at these three phases may be called starting voltage at the first phase, or stable discharge voltage or tube current at the third phase, for example. Sometimes it could be hard to distinguish the second phase from the third phase. In addition, since the second phase is hardly observed by the tube designs (for the tube length, outer and inner diameters of tube, pressure and composition of filler gas, and peripheral members of tube), it looks as if the first phase shifted to the third phase suddenly. This is because the stray capacitance is so big that the current cannot flow into the tube, the discharge surges immediately after the current flows into the tube, the impedance of the discharge path decreases due to the negative characteristics and a large amount of current flows in the tube all of a sudden. R1-2.3 From the viewpoint of discharge phenomenon, the voltages\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable Lighting Mode (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-2  From Discharge Starting to Stable Lighting Mode\n\nContent: applied to the tube at the first and third phases are important. Especially the voltage applied at the third phase should be noted practically. (The voltage applied at the second phase may be noted also.)\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R1-3  Cautions at Discharge Starting\n\nR1-3.1  At the discharge starting, α coefficient of discharge gas and $\\boldsymbol { \\gamma }$ coefficient of electrode are involved.  These coefficients contain the pressure of discharge gas (particle density) as a parameter. Especially when the mercury is filled in, the control of ambient temperature becomes very important because the mercury vapor (particle density) pressure changes sensitively to the ambient temperature.  \nR1-3.2  In addition, the lighting circuit is usually built for AC, the reduction of unnecessary stray capacitance base on frequency shall be required.  As the impact of stray capacitance becomes greater especially when the tube is thin and long, sufficient consideration shall be given.  \nFigure R1-1 1st Phase of CCFL Discharge Starting  \nFigure R1-2 From 1st Phase to $2 ^ { \\mathbf { n d } }$ Phase of CCFL Discharge Starting  \nFigure R1-3 2nd Phase of CCFL Discharge Starting  \nFigure R1-4 3rd Phase of CCFL Discharge Starting\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # RELATED INFORMATION 2 DARK CHARACTERISTICS OF DISCHARGE LAMP\n\nNOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI D35 and was derived from Japan Backlight TF.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-1  Start of Discharge Lamp\n\nR2-1.1  When a discharge lamp is activated, there must be electrons (initial electrons) in the discharge space generally.  In order to start up, it is necessary to apply an electric field, accelerate the initial electrons, excite and ionize gaseous particles, and establish discharges (keep up discharges) in the discharge space.  At that moment, the initial electrons are said to have relation to the continuity of discharges at random, and the combinations of the status of a lamp when manufactured, history of on/off of lighting, various factors of a discharge lamp, and lighting circuits are involved.  \nR2-1.2  For these reasons, in terms of the start-up of a discharge lamp, initial electrons are required and there are probability factors to be considered, and so the discharge start-up time delay should be observed statistically.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp and Remedy (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp and Remedy\n\nContent: R2-2.1 A discharge lamp usually starts up in a bright place even when the initial electron source is not provided especially. It is considered that this is because the external light gives energy to materials (gas, electrode, etc.) inside the discharge space to emit electrons (photoelectrons) as an initial electron. However, in order to activate the discharge lamp in a dark place, the photoelectron cannot be used. There are electron sources such as natural radiation as the other initial electrons (cosmic rays and radian from the earth) but these are not enough to get initial electrons at present. R2-2.1.1 Since the initial electrons in the discharge space in the darkness decrease greatly, the discharge start-up time delay, which is from the voltage-applied time to the start-up time, tends to be salient. This is defined as dark characteristics. R2-2.2 In order to start up a discharge lamp within a limited time, the method to supply positively initial electrons\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp and Remedy (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp and Remedy\n\nContent: in a discharge space is needed. For example, regarding a fluorescent lamp for ordinary lighting purpose, its negative electrode is preheated before the start-up. As a result, thermoelectrons, which are emitted from the emitter applied to the negative electrode, are used as an initial electron. For a glow starter, bremesstrahlung electrons by radioisotope (RI) built in the electrodes are employed. In addition, there are other methods such as applying high-voltage to supply electrons from the electrodes (field emission) and supplying photoelectrons by turning on another light source (light bulb) located nearby a discharge lamp before its start-up. R2-2.3 In terms of a discharge lamp used as an LCD backlight, the conventional remedies have not been utilized because it must have compact cathode electrodes, the RI is hardly used from the environmental view point, the output voltage for an inverter of high-frequency lighting circuit is limited, and the space is too\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp and Remedy (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-2  Dark Characteristics of Discharge Lamp and Remedy\n\nContent: small to built another light source in it. Thus, unique methods have been studied. Nowadays, the followings, such as exposing a metal oxide that emits exoelectrons\\*1 in the discharge space, forming spattering layers on the wall near cathode electrodes by lighting a discharge lamp for a certain time, and making a compound of materials with low work function\\*3 into electrodes or placing it near electrodes, are performed.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-3  Theory on Discharge Start-up Time Delay (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R2-3  Theory on Discharge Start-up Time Delay\n\nContent: R2-3.1 The equation on the discharge start-up time delay is as follows. $\\tau = 1 / ( \\mathrm { P } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { Q } )$ (1) where τ: average discharge start-up time delay (sec) P: percentage of one electron that discharges ( /particle) Q: number of initial electrons (particle/sec) R2-3.2 In Q factors mentioned before, such as the photoelectrons\\*4, thermoelectrons by external light, electrons emitted by field emission, electrons by natural radiation, electrons by RI, and exoelectrons, and in $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ factors, such as the voltage applied to a discharge lamp, filler gas pressure, kind of gases, electrode materials, impact of residual impure gases and concessionary shape of electrode, are involved.

If $\\boldsymbol { \\tau }$ becomes approximately 1 second, the initial electrons with order of $\\mathrm { ~ i 0 } ^ { 3 }$ particles per second will be required, and for 0.1 second, approximately initial electrons with the order of $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ particles per second will be required.

The CCFL has been developed with top priorities such as a narrow diameter, spacesaving shape and high brightness for its application and so the inverter has been requested to have a low profile space-saving shape with high efficiency as well.  \nR3-1.2  Understanding these requirements are satisfied and the characteristics such as high voltage, high frequency and micro current are compassable as tradeoff in the CCFL, we should handle it with care.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R3-2.1  Stray Capacitance\n\nR3-2.1.1  The stray capacitance is defined as a characteristic that behaves as if it had the electrostatic capacity that system does not provide and its volume is too unstable to be measured quantitatively (unintentional electrostatic capacity element).  If a formula for electrostatic capacity between two parallel copper wires is put into an equation, it will be nearly expressed as follows;  \n$\\mathbf { C } = \\mathbf { Q } / \\mathbf { V } = ( \\pi \\varepsilon 0 ) / ( \\log { ( ( \\mathbf { d } - \\mathbf { a } ) / \\mathbf { a } ) } \\dots { } ( 1 )$ where C: electrostatic capacity (stray capacitance) d: distance between wires a: diameter of wire  \nR3-2.1.2  According to the above-mentioned equation (1), it is understood that the stray capacitance does not affect the frequency but is inversely proportional to logarithm of the distance between wires.  (This means that the closer the distance between high potentials becomes, the more the stray capacitance increases, and the longer the wire becomes, the stray capacitance increases as well.)\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R3-2.2  Leakage Current (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R3-2.2  Leakage Current\n\nContent: R3-2.2.1 The leakage current is the inverter secondary current that flows to the above-mentioned stray capacitance. (It equal to the inverter secondary current except for that of CCFL.) Suppose “C” is the stray capacitance around CCFL and “I” is the current that flows to $^ { \\mathrm { 6 6 } } C ^ { \\prime }$ and sinusoidal AC voltage is applied, the bellow-equation is obtained. $\\mathrm { I } = \\mathrm { { \\sc { G P } } } \\mathrm { { .

R3-3.2 If the temperature of mercury particles is regarded as the same as the CCFL wall temperature when lighting, and suppose the tube temperature is $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ at $0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ of ambient temperature against wall temperature at $5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , approximately 1/10 of saturated steam pressure difference will take place and actual luminance of the tube will be approximately 1/2. On the contrary for the high temperature side, suppose the wall temperature is $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ against the ambient temperature $7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ the steam pressure difference which is greater by 20 times will take place and the actual tube luminance is approximately $2 / 3$ . R3-3.3 In this manner, the temperature and tube luminance\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R3-3  Temperature Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R3-3  Temperature Characteristics\n\nContent: have peak characteristics within a certain temperature range because the partial pressures of Ar, Ne and $\\mathrm { H g }$ have the optimum density against the lighting tube current. When the temperature is low, the luminance decreases due to the lack of absolute amount of ultraviolet rays caused by insufficient mercury molecules. R3-3.4 On the other hand, when the temperature is high, the mercury molecule density goes up dramatically, reabsorption of ultraviolet rays by mercury itself takes place, the amount of ultraviolet rays that reach the fluorescent substance decreases and so the luminance decreases accordingly. The further attention necessary is that the mass (thickness) of glass tube is made as thin as possible because the CCFL has been developed with such top priority as to have the narrow diameter, space-saving shape and high luminance.

R3-3.5 Since the luminance varies due to the impact to the glass temperature by each parameter such as the interference of surrounding members, contact of other materials and cooling effect of convective wind, it is recommended that measuring conditions should be specified and standardized as much as possible.\n\nSEMI D35-1103E TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF COLD CATHODE FLUORESCENT LAMP (CCFL) CHARACTERISTICS - # R3-4  Slide-up Speed\n\nR3-4.1  The status where a main discharge starts is measured for the measurement of stable discharge voltage sliding gradually the voltage up from the sufficiently low value. Since the starting point of main discharge may vary by the slide-up speed, a special attention should be paid.  \nR3-4.2  When the slide-up speed is so slow that the ratio of partial pressure of Ar, Ne and $\\mathrm { H g }$ shifts to the condition where lighting is easily performed because the mercury vapor pressure increases by the heat generation caused by half-lighting, the main discharge may begin easily compared to the condition at low CCFL temperature.  \nR3-4.3  Therefore, when measuring the CCFL, these conditions should be specified and standardized as much as possible.  \nCopyright by SEMI® (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International), 3081 Zanker Road, San Jose, CA 95134.

Maximum displacement can have the same value at several different locations, as shown in Figure 5. 5.1.2 Displacement Mode Terminology displacement modes are classified into five types caused by supporting conditions, which are number of NOTE 3: Depending on conditions, support span length may change slightly due to the substrate slipping on its support members, as shown in Figure 8. The support span is shorter when sag is relatively larger, as shown in Figure 9. On the other hand, the support span is longer when sag is relatively smaller, as shown in Figure 10. Since the change of support span is predicted to be\n\nSEMI D40-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR FPD SUBSTRATE DEFLECTION - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI D40-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR FPD SUBSTRATE DEFLECTION - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: significantly smaller than the support span, the change of support span is ignored. 5.1.2.3 M Type the type has an alphabetic “M” shape, which mixes the convex shape and the concave shape, as shown in Figure 11.

Inspect the display surface while displaying a white full screen, a black full screen, and a dark gray full screen (VESA FPDM 2.0). In many case, the Mura phenomena is detected by human eyes. But this is very confusing in the quality aspect. And it is very difficult to quantify the level.  \n6.2  The definition in SEMI D31 shows mainly that Luminance Mura is related with the size of Mura. Therefore this standard will follow the Cjnd concept.\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 6.3  Semu Definition (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 6.3  Semu Definition\n\nContent: 6.3.1 Under specific conditions, the below regression function can explain the level of Mura between the area and contrast for Human Mura JND. (Refer to SEMI D31.) Cjnd $= \\mathrm { F } \\left( \\mathrm { S j n d } \\right) = 1 . 9 7 / \\mathrm { S j n d } ^ { 0 . 3 3 } + 0 . 7 2$ Cjnd: Contrast of Mura at JND (Unit: $0 \\%$ relative to background $= 1 0 0 \\%$ ) Sjnd: The area of Mura at above contrast (Units: $\\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 \\cdot }$ ) 6.3.2 In the above equation, contrast at JND is inversely proportional to the area raised to the 0.33 powers. In short, it indicates that as Mura the area gets smaller, only darker Mura can be sensed. 6.3.2.1 For the subject Mura, the Mura level, Semu, can be calculated using the below formula. $$ \\begin{array} { r l } { \\mathbf { u } } & { { } = \\left| \\mathbf { C x } \\right| / \\mathbf { C j n d } } \\\\ { \\mathbf { \\Psi } } & { { } = \\left| \\mathbf { C x } \\right| / \\mathrm { F } \\left( \\mathbf { S x } \\right) } \\\\ { \\mathbf { \\Psi } } & { { } = \\left| \\mathbf { C x } \\right| / (\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 6.3  Semu Definition (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 6.3  Semu Definition\n\nContent: 1 . 9 7 / \\mathrm { S x } ^ { 0 . 3 3 } + 0 . 7 2 ) } \\end{array} $$ Cx: Average contrast of Mura being measured (Unit: $\\%$ relative to background $= 1 0 0 \\%$ ) Sx: The surface area of Mura being measured $( \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 } )$ )\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7  Measurement Method\n\n7.1  Environment Conditions:  \nTemperature: $2 5 \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$\nHumidity: $6 5 \\pm 2 0 \\%$ RH\nIllumination of surrounding: in a dark room below 10 lux\nAir flow: no wind\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.1  Warm-Up Time\n\n7.2.1.1  Warm-up time is the period from power-on to saturation of the light intensity. The optical measurement needs 15 to 30 minutes for more accurate measurement. In case of Mura, it has a little luminance difference between the luminance of Mura and the luminance of background the area. Therefore it must be measured in a saturate state.\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.2  Light Measurement Device (LMD) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.2  Light Measurement Device (LMD)\n\nContent: 7.2.2.1 When human eyes measure the FPD, it is detected in the total active area. So the measuring equipments must have similar characteristics to the human eye detecting method. In this standard, we recommend the CCD equipments to detect the Mura phenomena. 1) Dynamic Range — The dynamic range of the CCD equipment should be over 12 bits because the Semu value must be controlled by 0.1 Semu. 2) Luminance Accuracy — The Accuracy of Luminance is very important to measure Mura, because the Mura value is determined by low luminance difference. Therefore the accuracy of luminance should be $\\pm 0 . 0 1 ~ \\mathrm { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ at the $1 0 0 \\mathrm { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . 3) Measuring Points — The measuring points should be over 200(H) X 200(V) points. It is the same as the number of the CCD sensors. 7.2.3 Test Pattern for Semu Measurement 7.2.3.1 The test pattern should be set by $5 0 \\mathrm { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ in the white pattern. The permissible error is $1\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.2  Light Measurement Device (LMD) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.2  Light Measurement Device (LMD)\n\nContent: 0 \\mathrm { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . 7.2.4 Viewing Direction 7.2.4.1 The viewing direction angle should be set $9 0 ^ { \\circ } \\pm 1 ^ { \\circ }$ .\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.5  Measuring Distance for Semu Measurement\n\n7.2.5.1  Because we use a CCD Camera, the measuring distance is set by the same angle in all DUT. We standardize the $1 5 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ display size and testing distance is $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . But the testing distance should be different from each display size.  \n7.2.5.2  In case of the $1 5 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ display, the angle from the center to the edge position can be calculated below.  \n$$\n\\tan \\theta = { \\frac { d i a g o n a l \\_ d i s t a n c e \\times 0 . 5 } { M e a s u r i n g \\_ d i s t a n c e } } . . . . . . . . . . . ( 4 )\n$$  \nTherefore the reference angle is about $2 0 . 8 5 6 ^ { \\circ }$ and then it can be calculated the measuring distance of all DUT.  \n$$\nM e a s u r i n g \\_ d i s t a n c e = \\frac { d i a g o n a l \\_ d i s t a n c e \\times 0 . 5 } { \\tan \\theta } . \\nonumber\n$$  \nTable 1  Examples of Measuring Distance  \n$\\# 1$ This measuring distance can have the same measuring angle in each different size sample.\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.6  Determination of the Threshold for the Mura Area\n\n7.2.6.1  It is very important to calculate the Semu value. If some threshold values are different from each test equipment, the Semu test results are different. Therefore we use the $\\operatorname { C x }$ value to determine the threshold value. In this standard, when the $\\operatorname { C x }$ value is over 1.01, we can consider the Mura area.\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.7  Area Calculation Method\n\n7.2.7.1  There are two main parameters for calculating the Semu value. The first one is the $\\operatorname { C x }$ value and the other is the Sx value. The $\\operatorname { S x }$ value means that the surface area of Mura being measured. We can calculate the size of Mura area with counting the number of pixels under the CCD equipment test.\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.8  Test Sample Pattern for the Sample Test\n\n7.2.8.1  Originally, the test pattern should be set by $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ in the white pattern. And the permissible error is 10 $\\operatorname { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . But we use some artificial Mura test patterns for checking the sensitivity of the Semu parameter. The test pattern has 10 Muras in Figure 3. Each Mura has a different gray level. In Figure 3, the left one shows darker Mura patterns, and the right one shows brighter Mura patterns.\n\nSEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.9  Test Results for the Sample Patterns (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D41-0305 MEASUREMENT METHOD OF SEMI MURA IN FPD IMAGE QUALITY INSPECTION - # 7.2.9  Test Results for the Sample Patterns\n\nContent: 7.2.9.1 Table 2 shows that the actual results for the darker Mura test pattern and Table 3 is for the brighter Mura pattern.

The vaporized sample is withdrawn as a gas for analytical purposes. 4.2.4 Theory — The sampler is used to isolate a small but representative quantity of cryogenic liquid and vaporize the major component and all volatile impurities to form a homogeneous gas sample suitable for analysis. The cryogenic liquid is used to cool a shielding space and sampling cup prior to admitting the liquid to the sampling cup. The purpose of pre-cooling the sampling cup is to prevent concentrating impurities which could result when the warm cup causes the liquid to vaporize, leaving behind impurities with higher boiling points. 4.2.4.1 When the cup is adequately co oled, the sampling valve is opened, allowing liquid to\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PROCEDURE FOR THE SAMPLING OF LIQUID HYDROGEN.

This section will provide a guide for the format and representation of such a procedure. Figure 1 is designed to represent the format for submission of such methodology. 6.2 Sample Introduction — By its nature, gas chromatography implies the use of carrier gases into which the gaseous sample is injected and carried into the separation medium, either solid or liquid in nature. The introduction of a gaseous sample into a carrier gas stream is accomplished by means of a sample injection valve. Valves for this purpose can be any of several types, although the most commonly used are either rotary or diaphragm valves using loops of stainless steel tubing of a known volume. It is not necessary to diagram such sample introduction systems for a procedure unless the introduction system is unique to the application by way\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography\n\nContent: of special conditions for safety or other reasons critical to the accuracy of the sampling technique. 6.3 Separations — It is an acceptable and common practice to quantitate several gaseous impurities with a single gas chromatographic separation. Occasionally a single injected sample volume will undergo \"multidimensional\" separation to achieve the necessary analysis. Rotary valves, diaphragm valves or Dean's pressure switching again are used to move impurities from one separation medium to another, or from one column to another. Where multidimensional techniques are used, they should be accompanied by flowpath diagrams which clearly indicate valving and their appropriate positions. The valving sequences used should have adequate explanation to clarify the separations. 6.4 Columns — Columns used are generally of 3.2 mm (1/8 in.) o.d. and $2 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.085 in.) i.d. stainless steel of varying lengths and packed with one of many solid supports. Columns may be specified by length and packing material if these standard dimensions apply. If\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography\n\nContent: another dimension or material is used for the column itself, it should be specified by material type, and by o.d. and i.d. in mm. Packing materials should be specified by material, $\\%$ coating and coating type if applicable, and mesh size. Capillary columns are assumed to be fused silica unless otherwise specified and should be specified by i.d. in mm, film thickness in $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and length in meters. Column temperatures and applicable program rates should be given for each independently heated zone in degrees Celsius. 6.5 Carrier and Support Gases — Carrier and support gas flow rates for all separations should be specified. Carrier and support gases used should fall into the general purity requirements in Table 2 and purity need not be specified unless the analysis has specific purity requirements for safety, accuracy, or component lifetime. Flows should be specified in mL/min or $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { L } / \\operatorname* { m i n }$ , or as linear velocity for open tubular capillary columns. 6.6 Detectors — Detector technolo gy should be\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography\n\nContent: specified, and alternative detection may be assumed equivalent for detectors of like selectivity and sensitivity. Table 2 gives a reference of relative detector sensitivity and is provided as a guideline only. Detector parameters are less likely to be easily formatted since detector technologies vary widely in their specific parameters. All elements critical to achieving like sensitivity must be included, such as temperature, make-up gases and their flows, flame, combustion or reaction gas ratios or flows, voltages, currents, or any additional settings as outlined by the detector manufacturer. 6.6.1 Detection limits must be speci fied for each impurity for the actual methodology used. Because the lower detection limit can be greatly influenced by retention time for any impurity, it is important that the detection limit be derived for the impurity within the context of the method, and not solely on the detectability of the detector. Detection limits are assumed to be calculated on a mole/mole basis. 6.7 Operating Procedures — The standard procedure\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography\n\nContent: assumed for the gas chromatographic analysis of most gases is as follows: 1. Inject the calibration standard onto the column using a gas sampling valve. Record the retention time(s) and peak area(s) for all impurities detected. 2. Analyze the sample to be tested in the same manner as the calibration standard. 3. Repeat 1. 4. Compare the average peak area of the calibration standard with that of the sample being tested. (See Calculation of Concentration, in Section 6.9.) 6.7.1 The method should specify an y additional valve switching or special parameters which are necessary for the successful analysis of the impurities specified for the procedure. It must also specify the order of elution if multiple impurities are detected. 6.8 Calibration — Calibration for these analytical procedures is generally by external, single point calibration. Calibration gas mixtures should be specified and are assumed to be within the range specified in Section 2.26. Calibration standards are assumed to be made in a balance of gas representative of the sample unless\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography\n\nContent: otherwise specified. If calibration techniques other than external, point calibrations are used, they must be described. 6.9 Calculation of Concentration — The calculation of the concentration of impurity within the sample is based on a comparison of the average peak area of the impurity in the calibration standard, to the average peak area of the impurity within the sample, based on the formula: Sample Peak Area Concentration Concentration Standard Peak Area of Standard of Sample It is assumed that the results of such a calculation must not exceed the specification for the product being analyzed. 6.10 Notes — Any special requirem ents for any section within gas method may be included here. Notes should reflect the minimum requirements to successfully achieve the desired detection limits with the equipment specified. 1.1 Impurity analyzed - description of method (e.g., gas chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector). 1.1.1 Detection Limit - (mole/mole) 1.1.2 Instrument Parameters 1.1.2.1 Column(s): Adsorbent, mesh size, length in meters,\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 6  Gas Chromatography\n\nContent: (dimensions if other than 1/8 in. by 0.085 in.) 1.1.2.2 Carrier Flow: mL/min, gas type 1.1.2.3 Support Gases: 1.1.2.4 Sample Volume: mL 1.1.2.5 Temperatures: Detector: °C Columns: $^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ Other Equipment: $^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ 1.1.3 Calibration Standard - amount ppm (or ppb) impurity, balance if other than helium. 1.1.4 Operating Procedure (Parameters) 1.1.4.1 Order of elution 1.1.4.2 Special instructions 1.1.5 Notes 1.1.6 Figures\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7  Special Analyses\n\n7.1  Resistivity Measurement — Th e American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) is developing a method to measure resistivity in substrates.

Some of these materials are gaseous silicon-containing compounds, such as silane and the chlorosilanes. For elemental analysis by FTIR or PLS, a compound must first be converted to a solid form such as a single crystalline rod or disc. For the quantitative determination of metals and some non-metallic elements, the gases can be passed through a series of bubblers containing high-purity DI water or dilute acids. The aqueous media can be concentrated and analyzed by suitable techniques such as ICP or AA spectroscopy. In both cases, the recovery is assumed to be $100 \\%$ efficient or, in other words, there is no loss of any impurity from the silicon source. 7.2.2 FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra red) Spectroscopy, PLS (Photoluminescence Spectroscopy) and NAA (Neutron Activation\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: Analysis) are probably the most useful tools for the detection and analysis of trace quantities of elemental impurities in solid silicon materials. NAA requires special silicon material specimens to be submitted to neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor and the analysis facility to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other government agencies. In contrast, FTIR and PLS do not require special governmental regulations, and the instrumentation is available on the open market. 7.2.3 An FTIR spectrometer is an in frared spectrometer in which a Michelson Interferometer is used in place of a grating or prism. The simplicity of the Michelson Interferometer, with only one moving part, an oscillating mirror, along with a He-Ne laser as a reference, provides nearly absolute frequency accuracy. This translates into a high spectral resolution. FTIR has greater detection efficiency since the energy-wasting slits required for dispersive spectrometers are not used. With a microcomputer to control the functions and to\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: perform data processing, signal averaging is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. All these features lead to good reproducibility and rapid measurement results compared with conventional IR techniques. 7.2.3.1 As FTIR is a transmission met hod, it requires a single crystalline silicon specimen with flat, parallel, mirror-polished surfaces. For oxygen in silicon, the absorption peak at 9 microns is used for quantitative analyses. For carbon in silicon, the absorption band at 16 microns is used. Both measurements may be performed at room temperature. (The carbon determination has strong interference from the silicon phonon band, but can be resolved with high purity, carbon-free standards.) For the determination of shallow donors and acceptors, FTIR measurements must be made at liquid helium temperatures, but the through-put is low. Although the operation of today's FTIR instrument is relatively simple, the interpretation of the results through software and associated problems/solutions is not. Quantitative analysis is\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: based upon the measured percent transmission at the characteristic wavelength and compared to standards. Detection limits at about $1 0 \\mathrm { - } 1 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { K }$ are in the $1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 1 3 }$ atoms/cc for shallow donors and acceptors, $3 . 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 4 }$ atoms/cc for oxygen, and $2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 5 }$ atoms/cc for carbon.

The decay of these “exciton or multi-exciton” states yields the lines characteristic of the impurity atoms.

The luminescence process itself appears too complex to attain precision or accuracy from basic calculations. The PLS emissions are analyzed as a function of wavelength, suggested to be 1077 to 1139 nm, for the elemental determination of shallow donors and acceptors in silicon. Quantitative measurements of impurities are based on the extrinsic-to-intrinsic intensity ratio and compared to standards. The PLS emissions are analyzed using a monochromator and detected by a photomultiplier. Sensitivity in the range of $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 }$ to $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ atoms/cc has been claimed for B, Al, P, and As. 7.2.4.1 In order to obtain reliable mea surements, the silicon specimens must be in single crystalline form with a mirrored surface. Epitaxial wafers with layers of thickness greater than 10 microns are suitable, since the sample's depth appears to be less than 5 microns. However, it is still in the development stage,\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: and very few laboratories have such capability. A number of questions remain unanswered, including the following: 1. What is the effect of compensating impurities? 2. What is the effect of deep levels and intracenter transitions on the intensity ratios? 3. What is the effect of crystallographic defects? Of point defects? And of surface defects? 4. Interference from other shallow impurities may mask the detection of very low-level impurities. For instance, PLS signal of Al at $1 0 7 8 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ may be affected by strong signals from As at $1 0 7 9 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ or at $1 0 7 8 . 2 \\mathrm { n m }$ . 7.2.4.2 CVD-deposited films in single crystalline form can be used for elemental detection of donors and acceptors for gaseous silicon compounds. However, PLS does not detect carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen. It is also not useful for metallic impurities. That is, in general, PLS is useful only for a very limited number of impurities. 7.2.5 Based on this analysis, it was r ecommended that the SEMI Gases Analytical\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: Procedures Subcommittee should wait for further development of innovative and improved analytical techniques for the quantitative determination of low-level elemental impurities based on FTIR and PLS. Meanwhile, techniques such as ICP, AA, and Ion Chromatography may be applicable to a very large number of impurities of interest to the silicon semiconductor industry. Development and adaptation of these technologies should be encouraged. 7.2.6 AA (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry), ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry), and IC (Ion Chromatography) are probably the most valuable instrumental techniques for the detection and analysis of trace elemental impurities in aqueous media. These techniques usually require that the elements be dissolved in an aqueous medium. Due to this fact, and the fact that the elemental impurities are typically present in silane and the chlorosilanes at the ppb and sub-ppb levels (which is beyond the detection limits for these techniques for most elements) it is usually necessary to\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: concentrate the impurities prior to analysis, such as by passing the gas through a series of impingers (i.e., gas bubblers) containing either DI water or, more commonly, acidic solutions. From analyses of the impinger solutions together with knowledge concerning impinger solution volume(s) and both the flow rate and period of flow of the gas, the concentration of the respective elements in the original gas should be readily calculated to a fairly high degree of accuracy. 7.2.6.1 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry can be used for elemental analyses for a multitude of elements in the periodic table at detection limits ranging from ppm to ppb, depending both on the exact configuration or setup and the element being analyzed. The principle of the technique involves conversion of an incoming aerosol into an atomic vapor which can absorb light from a primary light source, usually a hollow cathode lamp or an electrodeless discharge lamp (EDL), the latter providing improved sensitivity and lower detection limits for certain\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: elements. In addition, a flameless (i.e., graphite furnace) technique can be used to increase sensitivities and detection limits 50 to 100 times better. 7.2.6.2 Complementary to Atomic Ab sorption Spectrophotometry is Flame Emission Spectrophotometry, which differs in the absence of a primary light source. Again, a flame is utilized to convert an incoming aerosol into an atomic vapor. However, the flame also thermally elevates the atoms to an excited electronic state, and, when the atoms return to the ground state, they emit light detectable by a photomultiplier. This technique is ideal for the analysis of Li, Ha, and K at ppm and sub-ppm levels. 7.2.6.3 Inductively Coupled Plasma E mission Spectrometry (ICP) is rapidly replacing Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for elemental analyses of liquids, since approximately $70 \\%$ of the elements in the periodic table can be determined with better precision and equal or better sensitivity with minimal sample preparation. Detection limits, in fact, for this technique range from\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: ppm to sub-ppb levels, depending both on instrumental and/or experimental conditions and the element being analyzed. ICP involves nebulizing liquid samples either directly or in diluted form into a spray chamber where a stream of argon gas carries the smaller sample droplets into the axial channel of an argon plasma which reaches temperatures of $4 0 0 0 { - } 8 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { K }$ . The common technique employs an optical system for detection. Newer techniques are being investigated using a mass spectrometer as a detection system coupled to an ICP excitation source. This is referred to as ICP/MS. 7.2.6.4 Ion Chromatography (IC) uses the principle of ion exchange to separate anionic and cationic species at detection limits ranging from ppm to ppb, depending again both on the instrumental and experimental conditions and on the element being analyzed. 7.2.6.5 Detection of ionic species in IC is most commonly accomplished by an electrical conductivity detector capable of measuring most non-transition metal cations\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: and anions to sub-ppm levels. An electrochemical detector (for amperometric detection) is available for measuring any electroactive species having an oxidation/reduction potential near the applied electrochemical cell potential. This latter detector is capable of measuring many ionic species at ppb levels (e.g., $\\mathrm { B r } ^ { - }$ , $\\mathrm { C N } ^ { - }$ , $\\mathrm { s } ^ { - }$ , etc.). 7.2.6.6 Of the three aforementioned te chniques, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry, Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry, and Ion Chromatography, the most sensitive method of analyzing for a multitude of elements is, without doubt, graphite furnace (i.e., flameless) Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. However, this instrumental technique suffers the disadvantage of being slow and tedious. Consequently, Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry is rapidly replacing Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for elemental analyses of liquids since it is a reasonably fast technique requiring minimal sample preparation\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: with practical detection limits being superior to those of standard (i.e., flame) Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for most elements and approaching those of graphite furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry for many of the elements. An added attractive feature of Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry is that eventually it may be used to analyze for elements directly in gases. Preliminary work, in fact, is currently being conducted in this area by several research groups. Although Ion Chromatography can be used to analyze for a multitude of non-transition metal cations (e.g., $\\mathrm { \\dot { L } i } ^ { + }$ , $\\mathrm { { N a } ^ { + } }$ , $\\mathbf { K } ^ { + }$ , ${ \\mathrm { R b } } ^ { + }$ , $\\mathrm { C s } ^ { + } \\ \\mathrm { B a } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { S r } ^ { + 2 }$ , etc.) it is limited by the fact that currently only a few transition metals (e.g., $\\mathrm { N i } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { C o } ^ { + 2\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 13)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: }$ , $\\dot { Z } \\mathrm { n } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { + 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { + 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { C d } ^ { + 2 }$ , etc.) can be analyzed by this instrumental technique. IC, however, has the advantage in that it can be used for analyzing for complex cationic and especially anionic species directly (e.g., $\\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } } ^ { + }$ , ${ \\mathrm { N O } } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ , $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { \\overline { { \\Omega } } }$ , ${ \\mathrm { S O } } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ , $\\mathrm { S O _ { 4 } } ^ { - 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { \\Delta P O _ { 4 } } ^ { - 3 }$ , OC1-, SCN-, CN-, $\\mathrm { C O _ { 3 } } ^ { - 2 }$ , etc.) and for different oxidation states for certain elements (e.g., $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { + 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { F e } ^ { + 3 } )$ , unlike the other techniques, which are strictly limited to elemental analyses only. Furthermore, IC is extremely valuable for analyzing ionic species, particularly anions (e.g., F , Cl , etc.) of many common elements which otherwise cannot be analyzed directly\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds (Part 14)\n\nTitle: SEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 7.2  Metal Analysis of Gaseous Sili con Compounds\n\nContent: by either Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry or Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry.\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 8  Standards\n\n8.1  Certified Standards shall be m ade by weight traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 9  Determination of Precisio n\n\n9.1  To Be Determined.\n\nSEMI C3-0699 SPECIFICATIONS FOR GASES - # 10  Safety\n\n10.1  Because of the continuing evo lution of safety precautions, it is impossible for this publication to provide definite statements related to the safe handling of individual chemicals.
