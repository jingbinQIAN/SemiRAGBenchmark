The applicability of this method and the validity of its assumptions in the application for which it is considered must be determined by an appropriate professional.\n\nSEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1 (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1\n\nContent: This method is designed to be protective of the health and safety of untrained and unprotected individuals. In this method, “non-hazardous” level is determined by assessment of the risk posed by potential exposure to the contaminant(s). (This method is based on the assumptions that 1) the exposed portions of a worker’s body collect a single layer of the contaminant, with a density half that of the layer on the contaminated surface, in the course of a day and that 2) this contaminant is then incorporated, at the end of the day, into the body by either absorption or ingestion.) This method is, therefore, probably inappropriate for contaminants which are absorbed rapidly throughout the day. R2-1.1 Toxicity criteria are determined for each of the chemicals identified as potentially leaving a residue. As an example, toxicity criteria used are reference doses (RfDs) for human uptake of chemicals (US EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System, 1996), and no significant risk levels (NSRLs) defined under California’s Safe Drinking\n\nSEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1 (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1\n\nContent: Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Daily exposures to the RfD (expressed in mg/kg-day) over a lifetime are not expected to cause adverse health effects (non-cancer effects). Daily exposure to the NSRL $\\mathrm { ( \\mu \\ g / d a y ) }$ over a lifetime are considered to pose an insignificant (less than 1 in 100,000) increased cancer or reproductive risk. R2-1.2 Oral and dermal exposures are considered. Dermal exposure is assumed to occur through direct contact with contaminated work surfaces (i.e., hands, arms, and face). Oral exposure is assumed to occur though direct contact with contaminated work surfaces and hands, and subsequent contact between hand and mouth. R2-1.3 The equations used in this method to calculate the oral and dermal “Health-Based Cleanup Levels (HBCL’s)” are: $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { H B C L } _ { \\mathrm { o r a l } } = \\underline { { \\mathrm { R f D } \\times \\mathrm { B W } } } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { S A } _ { \\mathrm { o } } \\times \\mathrm { M F } \\times \\mathrm { C\n\nSEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1 (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1\n\nContent: E } \\times \\mathrm { A F } _ { \\mathrm { o } } \\times \\mathrm { E F } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { H B C L } _ { \\mathrm { d e r m a l } } = \\underline { { \\mathrm { R f D } \\times \\mathrm { B W } \\times \\mathrm { E D } } } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { S A } _ { \\mathrm { d } } \\times \\mathrm { C E } \\times \\mathrm { A F } _ { \\mathrm { d } } \\times \\mathrm { E F } } \\end{array}$ Where : RfD = EPA RfD [mg/kg − day] BW $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ Body weight [70 kg] $\\mathrm { E D = }$ Exposure duration [0.5 days] $\\mathbf { S } \\mathbf { A } _ { 0 } = \\mathbf { \\Phi }$ Surface area of exposed hands $\\left[ 0 . 0 8 4 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\right]$ ] $\\mathbf { S A } _ { \\mathrm { d } } = \\pmb { \\Omega }$ Surface area of exposed hands, forearms, and head $[ 0 . 3 1 6 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 \\cdot } ]$ ] $\\mathbf { M F } =$ Fraction of exposed dermal are contacted by mouth [0.5/day] ${ \\mathrm { C E } } = { \\mathrm { S k i n } }$ contact efficiency [0.5] $\\mathrm { A F _ { o } = }$ Gastro - intestinal absorption factor [1.0]\n\nSEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1 (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1\n\nContent: (conservative) $\\mathrm { A F _ { d } = }$ Dermal absorption factor [0.01] EF $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ Exposure factor [12 hours/24 hours; 250 days/365 days; 40 years/70 years $= 0 . 2 0 ]$ Body weight and surface area factors are as suggested by EPA’s Exposure Factors Handbook (1989). The fraction of skin contaminant that will be ingested orally (MF) is conservatively assumed to be $50 \\%$ . This is approximately equivalent to a person ingesting all of the chemical that contacts the palms of the hands, but not the backs. Contact efficiency (CE) refers to the fraction of chemical that is removed from the contaminated surface through contact with the skin. It is assumed that no more than $50 \\%$ of the chemical contamination from equipment will rub off the surface and adhere to the skin. Oral and dermal absorption factors are chosen as the most conservative numbers due to limited available data. The exposure factor (EF) represents the fraction of time that a person could be expected to be in contact with\n\nSEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1 (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI S10-1103 SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK EVALUATION PROCESS - # R2-1  Method 1\n\nContent: chemical contamination from exposed surfaces. Exposure to surfaces is assumed to follow an occupational exposure scenario. This scenario includes the following conservative assumptions: • A person works at the facility for 40 years of a 70-year lifetime; • Exposure occurs 250 days per year (365 days); • The skin is in contact with the chemicals for 12 hours per day. This assumes that the chemicals are not removed from the skin until washed, and the skin is washed only once per day. R2-1.4 The final HBCL for each chemical is then the lower of the levels for oral or dermal exposure routes. NOTE: These HBCLs represent levels that are considered to be health-protective for a person who contacts equipment with residual contamination on a daily basis. These values are based on extremely conservative assumptions and are likely to provide an overestimate of a health-protective clean-up level.

The evaluator should also review any assessment of the material, component, or equipment as a whole by an accredited testing laboratory. 6.1.3 The risk assessment should include both normal operation and the consequence of reasonably foreseeable, single-point failures within the equipment. It should not include exposure to fire or external ignition sources not within the intended use environment. 6.1.4 Certifications by an accredited testing laboratory of materials, components, or the equipment as a whole may be used in the fire risk assessment. However, such certifications are valid only to the extent that the conditions of use for the certification correlate to the conditions of use for the equipment whose fire risk is\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  Fire Risk Assessment (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  Fire Risk Assessment\n\nContent: being assessed. NOTE 9: For example, a personal computer certified to IEC 60950 might be incorporated into equipment for use as a controller. The material flammability requirements of IEC 60950 may or may not be sufficient for this use of the personal computer, depending upon its exposure to oxidizers and external sources of ignition when incorporated into the equipment. Also, the levels of smoke tolerable in the environment for which a general industry standard was written may exceed those tolerable in semiconductor manufacturing cleanrooms. Furthermore, if the equipment is intended to be used in a potentially explosive atmosphere, the certification to IEC 60950 would not sufficiently control its risk of being a source of ignition. 6.1.5 The consequences and the probability of fire from each identified hazard should be assessed and rated, as described in SEMI S10. See Appendix 1 for the criteria used for the assignments of Severity, Likelihood and Risk in this document.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  Fire Risk Assessment (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  Fire Risk Assessment\n\nContent: 6.1.5.1 The assigned Severity and Likelihood and resulting Risk category should be recorded as part of the analysis. 6.1.5.2 For those hazards for which the Risk depends on the conditions of use or use environment, the equipment supplier should make and state appropriate assumptions. If the equipment supplier is unable to make appropriate assumptions as to the Likelihood because it depends predominantly on factors in the users' sole control (e.g., adherence to specified procedures), the supplier should state that and provide an estimate of the Severity. NOTE 10: The facilities requirements on which the risk assessment depends are to be specified by the equipment supplier. 6.1.6 For fire to occur, there must be a fuel, an oxidizer and a source of ignition. Elimination of any of these factors eliminates the risk of fire. Similarly, the Severity, Likelihood and Risk of a fire can be reduced by reducing one or more of these elements appropriately. 6.1.7 It is important to remember\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  Fire Risk Assessment (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  Fire Risk Assessment\n\nContent: that there are often implicit oxidizers (e.g., room air) and sources of ignition (e.g., room temperature for a pyrophoric material). 6.1.8 The fire risk assessment should include the judgement of a qualified (as described in SEMI S7) party to determine the level of detail of the assessment. That party may group similar hazards for assessment and reporting. NOTE 11: Such grouping could include, for example, all of the knobs and buttons of similar materials into one group, the heated surfaces into a second, and the several flammable liquids with similar properties into a third.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2  Fuels\n\n6.2.1  Fuels include all those materials capable of reacting with an oxidizer in a fire.  The risks of both the materials of which the equipment is constructed and the process chemicals used in it should be assessed.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.2  Materials of Construction (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.2  Materials of Construction\n\nContent: 6.2.2.1 The risk assessment should include all of the materials of construction, regardless of quantity or application. NOTE 12: This includes small parts, such as knobs, buttons, electrical contactors, terminal strips, circuit boards, signal wire and power wiring as well as large components, modules (such as mini-environments) and subassemblies. NOTE 13: Some of the smallest components can create a high risk, as in the potential for ignition by adiabatic compression of fluoropolymer seats in high pressure oxygen valves. NOTE 14: The assessment can be simplified by grouping similar items together. Example 1: wiring that has the same type of insulation. Example 2: knobs, switches, handles and latches made from similar polymers. Identified groups should include their approximate total mass. 6.2.2.2 In assessing the risk, the evaluator should consider: the size of each component, the total quantity and distribution of similar components, the inherent properties of the\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.2  Materials of Construction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.2  Materials of Construction\n\nContent: material, such as ignitability, flame spread, heat of combustion, and byproducts (See Appendix 2 for guidance on evaluation of these properties.), the exposure to oxidizers, and the exposure to ignition sources. NOTE 15: The specification control of materials used in approved electrical components should also be considered. Approvals may allow for substitution of many materials with equivalent flammability ratings. NOTE 16: The inherent properties of materials affect two types of risk within the equipment: flame spread risk and contamination risk (i.e., smoke damage from combustion byproducts). In the case of electrical and electronic components used in assemblies and equipment that are constructed and used in accordance with applicable standards (e.g., IEC 61010-1, IEC 60204-1), flame spread risk may be adequately controlled by the standard, and detailed assessment of the material properties of such components that affect flame spread may not be warranted. However, a\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.2  Materials of Construction (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.2  Materials of Construction\n\nContent: significant contamination risk could still remain (e.g., a standard may allow a component mounted on a printed circuit board to fail and burn, as long as the burning remains local to the printed circuit board) and warrant a detailed assessment of related material properties of the components. The level of detail of the assessment may also be affected by the mitigation method chosen (see Section 7).\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.3  Process Chemicals (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.3  Process Chemicals\n\nContent: 6.2.3.1 This portion of the risk assessment should include all of the process chemicals expected (based on the equipment supplier' s recommended or baseline processes) to be used in the equipment. It should also include flammable and combustible wastes generated or collected within the equipment and fluids in the equipment which are required for its operation but which do not participate chemically in the process (e.g., vacuum pump oil). 6.2.3.2 In assessing the risk, the evaluator should consider: the quantity, concentration, state, temperature, and pressure of each chemical in each container, for those chemicals supplied automatically by the facility, the available flow, pressure, and total quantity, the aggregate supplies and distribution of similar chemicals, the inherent properties of the chemicals, such as flammable limits, flash point, autoignition temperature, heat of combustion, and the products of combustion and decomposition (see the Material Safety Data Sheets for\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.3  Process Chemicals (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.2.3  Process Chemicals\n\nContent: guidance on evaluation of these properties), the exposure to oxidizers, and the exposure to ignition sources. NOTE 17: Chemicals with similar fire properties may be considered together for the purpose of this assessment.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.3  Sources of Ignition\n\n6.3.1  Sources of ignition can be broadly divided into those within the equipment and those external to it.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.3.2  Internal Sources\n\n6.3.2.1  Potential electrical ignition sources:  \ndevices or conditions that in normal operation can generate ignition energy (e.g., heaters, static electricity, lasers);\ndevices or conditions that in reasonably foreseeable assembly, use and/or wear conditions can generate ignition energy (e.g., power connectors, terminal strips);\ndevices that in reasonably foreseeable single point failure modes can generate ignition energy (e.g., transformers, electronic components); and\nshort circuits.  \n6.3.2.2  Potential chemical ignition sources:  \nexothermic process chemical reactions, exothermic reactions from inadvertent mixing of process chemicals, exothermic reactions between process chemicals and materials of construction, and  \nrelease of pyrophoric or air-reactive chemicals from processing or maintenance.  \n6.3.2.3  Sudden changes in process conditions:  \nrapid (sometimes called “adiabatic”) compression of gas mixtures, and\nrapid increases in temperature.  \n6.3.2.4  Mechanical friction\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.3.3  External Sources\n\n6.3.3.1  External sources include expected and foreseen conditions of the equipment’s use.  As these are factors normally outside the control of the equipment supplier, their risks are difficult to assess.  They are outside the scope of this document.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.4  Oxidizers\n\n6.4.1  The most common oxidizer is air, which is present within and around most semiconductor manufacturing equipment.  Unless specific measures are taken to exclude air (e.g., inert pressurizing of an electrical enclosure), it should be assumed to be available in infinite supply.  \n6.4.2  It is possible that some materials of construction will act as oxidizers or will yield oxidizers when subjected to heat.  \n6.4.3  Several common process chemicals (e.g., oxygen and hydrogen peroxide) are oxidizers.  Their risks should be assessed in a manner similar to that described above for process chemicals that are fuels.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5  Reporting\n\n6.5.1  Although these guidelines are intended for use throughout the design and development process, it is not the intent of these guidelines that the equipment supplier should make all of the information recorded during the development of the equipment available to others.  The equipment supplier should document the fire risk assessment and mitigation in three forms: internal records, a final fire risk assessment report, and a summary report.  \n6.5.2  Relevant analyses, assessments, and design decisions should be documented in the equipment supplier' s internal records. These records need not, however, be made available to other parties.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report\n\nContent: 6.5.3.1 This report should contain an itemized list of the residual risks identified in reviewing the final design, considering the risks described in the preceding subsections or otherwise known or foreseen by the evaluator. Only those risks meeting the criteria in Appendix 1 should be included. For each identified residual risk, the report should: explain the mechanism of loss or damage; identify aggravating or necessary contributing factors; identify the mitigating factors; state the assigned Severity for each type of loss and present the rationale for its assignment. A “type” is a column in Table A1-1, e.g., “Equipment Physical Damage”; state the assigned Likelihood and present the rationale for its assignment; and state the resulting Risk category. NOTE 18: Criteria for risks may be found in Appendix 1, Sections A1-2.5 through A1-2.8. 6.5.3.2 This report should also describe the fire risk mitigation techniques included in the equipment design. 6.5.3.3 The\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report\n\nContent: final fire risk assessment report should be prepared or reviewed by a party qualified, as described in SEMI S7, to do such work. NOTE 19: This party may be an employee of the equipment supplier or may be a third party. 6.5.3.4 When this guideline is being used as part of a SEMI S2 equipment evaluation, the manufacturer should make the final fire risk assessment report available to the party performing the SEMI S2 evaluation. 6.5.3.5 The equipment supplier may make the final fire risk assessment report available to other parties. used for each system. Therefore, the decision to include a particular mitigation technique should be based on the assessed risk. NOTE 21: Fire detection and suppression are also means of mitigating fire risk. The criteria for fire detection and suppression systems are in SEMI S2. 7.1.2 In mitigating risks, the general hierarchy of elimination, engineering controls, administrative controls, warning and work practices should be followed.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.3  Final Fire Risk Assessment Report\n\nContent: Following this hierarchy comprises using techniques which are highest in it if several techniques are equally applicable. Design and use constraints, as well as relative cost, however, may justify using techniques from generally less preferable categories. In any case, the residual risk should be assessed and reported.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7.2.1  Materials of Construction\n\n7.2.1.1  The lowest fire risk is posed by noncombustible materials of construction.  Available noncombustible materials are not, however, suitable or desirable for all applications within semiconductor manufacturing equipment.  \nNOTE 22:  The properties necessary to perform the intended function of system components and the properties necessary to satisfy component-level standards may also restrict the use of noncombustible materials.  \n7.2.1.2  When materials which are combustible are chosen, the fire risk may be mitigated by:\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6.5.4  Summary Report\n\n6.5.4.1  The summary report should be prepared from the final fire risk assessment report and contain:  \na list of the residual fire risks and their ratings, and brief descriptions of the fire risk mitigation techniques included in the equipment.  \n6.5.4.2  The equipment supplier should provide the summary report to users of the equipment and may provide it to other parties.  \nselecting those materials with the least undesirable properties as described above; and minimizing the total mass and distribution of such materials.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7.2.2  Process Chemicals\n\n7.2.2.1  It may be possible to reduce the fire risk by changing the quantities and species of the chemicals used in the intended processes.  \n7.2.3  The fire risks of combustible materials of construction and flammable and combustible process chemicals may also be reduced by limiting those factors described in Section 6.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7.1  Overview\n\n7.1.1  This section describes several means of mitigating the risks of fire.  It describes ways in which the equipment and its use can be designed to minimize the risks.  \nNOTE 20:  The description of a mitigation technique in this section is not intended to imply that such technique should be\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7.3  Sources of Ignition\n\n7.3.1  Potential sources of ignition should be considered in conjunction with the fuels and oxidizers they might ignite.  \n7.3.2  Risks due to sources of ignition can be mitigated by:  \nlimiting their number,  \nlimiting their energy, and\nseparating them from combustible materials of construction and from flammable and combustible process chemicals.  Separation may be by distance or by barriers.  \n7.3.3  Equipment in which flammable liquids or gases are used should be assessed to determine if additional precautions (e.g., purging) in the electrical design are necessary.  \nNOTE 23:  NFPA 497 and EN 1127-1 are among the documents that provide methods for making this assessment.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7.4  Oxidizers\n\n7.4.1  Reducing the quantities or pressures of oxidizing process chemicals may reduce the fire risk.  \n7.4.2  The fire risks of oxidizing process chemicals may also be reduced by limiting those factors described in Section 6.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7.5  Exhaust, Enclosures and Barriers\n\n7.5.1  Mechanical exhaust may reduce the risk of damage to the facility, other equipment, or other portions of the same equipment by limiting the spread of combustion and decomposition products. The mechanical exhaust could be provided by the equipment or by the facility.  \n7.5.2  Enclosures and barriers within the equipment may reduce the fire risk by separating the fuels and oxidizers from each other and from potential sources of ignition.  \n7.5.3  These design features may also limit the spread of fire, reducing both the loss of equipment and the emission of combustion and decomposition products.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8.1  SEMI Standard\n\nSEMI S11 — Environmental, Safety, and Health Guidelines for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Minienvironments  \nFlammable Liquids, Gases, or Vapors and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas  \n8.3  CEN/CENELEC Standards4  \nEN 1127-1 — Explosive Atmosphere – Explosion prevention and protection – Part 1 Basic concepts and methodology\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8.4  Other Documents\n\nBuilding Officials and Code Administrators $\\left( \\mathrm { B O C A } \\right) ^ { 5 }$ , NBC: National Building Code  \nFactory Mutual System Data Sheet ${ 7 } { - } { 7 } ^ { 6 }$ , Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities  \nInternational Conference of Building Officials (ICBO)7, UBC: Uniform Building Code  \nInternational Fire Code Institute8, UFC: Uniform Fire Code  \nInternational SEMATECH9, Process Compatibility Parameters for Wet Bench Plastic Materials (Technology Transfer # 98123623A)  \nSouthern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI)10, SBC: Standard Building: Code\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8.2  NFPA Documents\n\nNational Fire Protection Association: NFPA 70 —\nNational Electric Code (NEC)\nNational Fire Protection Association: NFPA 318 —\nStandard for Protection of Cleanrooms\nNational Fire Protection Association: NFPA 496 —\nStandard for Purged and Pressurized Enclosures for\nElectrical Equipment\nNational Fire Protection Association: NFPA 497 —\nRecommended Practice for the Classification of\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # APPENDIX 1 RISK ASSESSMENT CRITERIA\n\nNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI S14 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on September 3, 1999 by the North American Regional Standards Committee.  \nA1-1  The risk assessment should be performed for each identified fire hazard using the method provided in SEMI S10 and the following definitions of Likelihood and Severity Groupings and Risk Categories.  \nNOTE A1-1:  Unlike SEMI S10, in which the tables are provided only as examples, this document defines the Severity, Likelihood, and Risk to be used herein.  \nA1-2  Severity  \nA1-2.1  The Severity Groupings are given in Table A1-1.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # Table A1-1 Severity Groupings (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # Table A1-1 Severity Groupings\n\nContent: A1-2.2 The Severity should be assigned for each of the columns for which information is available. A1-2.3 The most severe Group assigned should be used in determining the risk. A1-2.4 Each of the Severities should be reported. A1-2.5 Contamination is by release of materials that were used in the equipment or by combustion or thermal degradation byproducts. A1-2.6 To be included in the assessment, a foreseen occurrence must be unplanned and include a loss. A1-2.7 Losses exclude the performance of the design function of protective devices, such as fuses. A1-2.8 The scope of the assessment in this document is limited to the consequences of fire. A1-2.9 The Equipment Loss of Use time is the downtime, as defined in SEMI E10, resulting from the fire incident. A1-3 Likelihood A1-3.1 The Likelihood Groupings are given in Table A1-2.

Three industry standard test methods were used to determine the outgassing, leaching, and extraction parameters, defined in combination as the process compatibility parameters. To supplement them, the presence of critical elements at the surface of the materials and the condition of the surface were examined before and after exposure to water and chemicals. Changes in the mass of plastic materials as a result of outgassing, leaching, and extraction were also used to supplement the parameters. The report includes details of the test procedures, data analysis, surface topography of the plastic materials, before and after exposure to water and chemicals, and discussion of the results.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # ? semi\" RELATED INFORMATION 2 SMOKE MANAGEMENT IN CLEANROOMS\n\nNOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI S14 and was derived from the work of a member of the Fire Protection Task Force of the North American Environmental, Health, and Safety Committee.  This related information was approved for publication by 2/3 committee vote on July 17, 2003.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-1  Introduction\n\nR2-1.1  Semiconductor cleanrooms are operationally sensitive to products of a fire.  A fire will result in smoke and corrosive particle contamination to the cleanroom, process equipment, and work in process.  A properly designed, installed, and maintained smoke detection and control system will not prevent contamination, but will limit the spread and concentration of the contaminant.  The basis of the smoke control system design should be aligned with the organization’s risk management objectives.  \nR2-1.2  This Related Information deals with smoke management systems for cleanrooms themselves, not for equipment.  Smoke removal from a cleanroom may be performed by ventilation systems that are in place for other purposes (e.g., process exhaust systems of equipment) or by equipment designed and installed specifically to remove smoke from the room.  These may both be parts of the protection for a cleanroom and may differ in how they are activated.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-2  Actuation\n\nR2-2.1  Automatic actuation of dedicated smoke control systems is preferable; however, many facilities prefer manual activation.  If the system is manually activated, the following should be done.  \nR2-2.1.1  The smoke detection system should be monitored by qualified personnel 24 hours per day.  \nR2-2.1.2  Emergency response teams (ERT) or other personnel authorized to actuate the manual smoke control system should be capable of prompt notification.  \nR2-2.1.3  Detailed smoke control emergency procedures should be documented and practiced.  These procedures can include hazardous gas shutdowns and shutdowns of appropriate air recirculation fans as well as activating the smoke control exhaust fans.  \nR2-2.2  A secondary means of manual actuation of the smoke/contaminant control system should be provided in a clearly marked and accessible area outside the cleanroom.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-3  Capacity\n\nR2-3.1  The smoke control system capacity needed is directly related to the design fire size which depends upon the type, amount and arrangement of combustible materials in the cleanroom.  In order to achieve a system that is economically feasible, the maximum design fire size should be limited to the fire size at sprinkler operation. For a typical cleanroom configuration, the fire size at sprinkler operation is in the range of 600 to 800 kilowatts.  \nR2-3.2  Smoke removal system capacity can be designed based on an integrated system approach.  The total capacity can include the fume exhaust system capacity and dedicated smoke removal system capacity.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-4  Design Considerations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-4  Design Considerations\n\nContent: R2-4.1 When the fume exhaust system is used for smoke removal, the following design parameters should be followed. R2-4.1.1 The fume exhaust system ductwork should be of non-combustible construction or should be listed/approved for smoke removal and not incorporate the use of fire dampers or interrupters. R2-4.1.2 It should be confirmed that sufficient fume exhaust system intake points exist throughout the clean room. If not, additional intake points should be provided and incorporate the use of normally closed dampers. These dampers should be opened either automatically by activation of the smoke detection system or by manual means. R2-4.1.3 When the fume exhaust system is used for smoke removal, it can incorporate the use of variable speed fan(s). During the smoke removal mode, fire dampers on supplemental intake points will open and the fan speed will be increased. The design capture velocity at the tool(s) could be affected, and this should be reviewed. Necessary\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-4  Design Considerations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-4  Design Considerations\n\nContent: balancing changes should be made to ensure the design capture velocity is maintained. R2-4.2 The ventilation system make-up air fans should be sized such that under full smoke and process exhaust, the fabrication area maintains a positive pressure relative the adjacent areas. R2-4.3 Smoke removal system intake locations are dependent on the fabrication area design. Design alternatives should be addressed with a competent fire protection engineering design firm. For example, for open manufacturing areas, smoke removal system intake sequencing should be designed such that individual zones can be activated to prevent contaminant migration to adjacent clean areas of the fab. From a smoke removal perspective, ducted returns are a better option than open attic plenum configurations.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R2-5  Testing\n\nR2-5.1  The smoke/contaminant control system should have a functional test done annually of all detection and control systems including system dampers and fans. The system should be designed so that operational and functional testing can be done without interruption to the normal clean room air handling.  \nR2-5.2  The smoke/contaminant control system for new semiconductor facilities should be fully tested during mechanical system tests done near the end of the construction process.  Testing should consist of a complete functional test of detection and control systems, plus activation of smoke/contaminant removal fan and damper systems.  The performance of the smoke/contaminant removal system should be verified using either sulfur hexafluoride $\\left( \\mathrm { S F } _ { 6 } \\right)$ or another tracer gas method.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # T seml RELATED INFORMATION 3 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS\n\nNOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI S14 and was derived from the work of a member of the Fire Protection Task Force of the North American Environmental, Health, and Safety Committee.

R3-1.2 The following information is intended to assist stakeholders involved in the process of designing, installing, and maintaining fire protection of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Further information can be found in the appropriate fire protection codes and standards applicable to the type of fire protection system and in related documents. NOTE R3-1: The term “fire suppression” is limited to extinguishing fire, once it has begun. The term “fire protection” incorporates fire suppression and other means of mitigating the risk of fires, including fire detection and materials selection. R3-1.3 The use of contractors with previous experience in the design and installation of fire protection of\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-1  Introduction\n\nContent: cleanrooms and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is desirable. R3-1.4 Independent third party review of fire protection designs and installations by a fire protection engineer with relevant experience can also help to ensure that systems are correctly designed and installed. NOTE R3-2: The material in this Related Information is presented as additional guidance in designing, installing, and maintaining fire protection systems in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Although this information is believed to be useful in optimizing such systems, the material in this Related Information does not comprise additional criteria for determining conformance to the provisions of SEMI S2 or SEMI S14.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-2  Design Review (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-2  Design Review\n\nContent: R3-2.1 Ensure that system proposed uses approved or listed components and that they are used within their listing or approval, e.g., FM Approved wet bench fire suppression systems should be used for open faced wet bench whereas an enclosed tool can use a system comprising of FM approved & compatible components. R3-2.2 Detection needs to be selected to suit the working environment and the type of fire/smoke that is anticipated. For example, optical detectors need to have been tested and approved/listed for use with specific flammable liquids or gases. Flames and smoke from burning materials have varying physical characteristics which mean that some detection devices will not always react promptly. R3-2.3 The location of detection devices in relation to hazards needs to be carefully considered. A detector that is located too close to a heat source may activate when it sees normal process conditions rather than fire conditions. R3-2.4 Some optical detectors may also be susceptible to\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-2  Design Review (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-2  Design Review\n\nContent: accidental activation if they are exposed to welding flashes. Care in detector selection can avoid this, but implementing strict cutting and welding working practices and permissions can also play an important part.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review\n\nContent: R3-3.1 Once completed by the fire protection installer, the fire protection installation should be inspected and reviewed by a competent and experienced fire protection engineer. This review will: R3-3.1.1 Verify installation against previously working drawings. R3-3.1.2 Ensure that specified equipment has been installed as indicated on the working drawings and in line with equipment approvals and listings. R3-3.2 Distribution pipework networks should be complete (including all connections), properly supported using listed and approved equipment. Frequent failures of piped systems, including $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ systems, occur due to incorrectly connected pipes or where fittings have not been made or sufficiently tightened. R3-3.3 Supports for pipework should be able to withstand the expected forces that will be experienced during discharge of the suppression system. This is important to protect personnel and property from moving pipes in high-pressure systems using\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review\n\nContent: agents such as carbon dioxide. R3-3.4 Detection systems should have components installed as per reviewed drawings, however it is not always possible during desktop drawing review to identify that detectors are correctly sited. As a result the field review should concentrate on ensuring that components are located so that they can see the hazard without obstruction, including clear vision panels, which may prevent detector from “seeing” the flame. R3-3.5 Similarly detectors need to be sited so that they will not experience normal process temperatures, radiation or be exposed to chemical, liquid or particles that could result in an accidental activation. R3-3.6 Where linear heat detection cable is used it should be located where it will not be exposed to levels of ambient or process related heat that could trigger an alarm signal. In addition the cable should be securely attached to prevent it dislodging and coming into contact with hot surfaces. R3-3.7 Nozzle locations in\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review\n\nContent: many suppression systems can be critical to ensuring functionality, reliability and safety. For example, $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ nozzles incorrectly positioned can result in chemical splashing or dislodging product or quartzware. If nozzles are exposed to chemical action including corrosive chemicals, it is important that the materials are resistant to the chemical R3-3.8 Where automatic sprinkler heads are used, the fusible link should be adequately protected from chemical and mechanical attack. function. The types of problems that can be picked up by discharge testing are: R3-4.3.1 Lack of extinguishing agent R3-4.3.2 Inability to transfer agent from supply to nozzles due to: Blockages arising from incorrect equipment, Incomplete piping, loose fittings & supports, and Installation, design problems (e.g,. icing up of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ pipes or nozzles). R3-4.4 In many cases discharge testing within the cleanroom environment is not considered acceptable or\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-3  Installation Review\n\nContent: practical. Accordingly, alternatives such as type testing can prove that the design will provide the necessary protection, but may need to be supplemented by a more rigorous commissioning test of the final systems. Type testing would involve the installation and discharge testing of a system on a tool during manufacture or on a mock up of the tool. The aim would be to prove that distribution pipework and nozzles have been correctly designed and that the concentration of agents and distribution patterns from nozzles is acceptable. This would be supplemented by additional tests on each installation, including pressure tests of pipework and “puff” tests to verify pipework integrity.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-4  Commissioning Tests\n\nR3-4.1  All installations should undergo a thorough commissioning and acceptance test conducted by the installer and witnessed by the owner or owner’s representative.  \nR3-4.2  Functional Tests are essential, but not sufficient to ensure that system will operate as in tended.  The types of problems that can be picked up by functional testing are:  \nR3-4.2.1  Inability of detection system to detect as intended,  \nR3-4.2.2  Inability of control system to receive signal from individual detectors, and  \nR3-4.2.3  Inability of alarm panel to initiate system discharge or send alarm signals to connected devices and safety systems, e.g.,  \nlocal or remote alarm panels,\nsounders & warning devices, and\ninterlocks to equipment shutdown and safety systems, EMO.  \nR3-4.3  Discharge Testing is the only way that we can ensure that that a system will fulfill its intended\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-5  Burn In\n\nR3-5.1  In order to avoid unnecessary discharges, a period of burn-in for the detection system is advisable. This involves the detection system operating, enabling detection of fires and initiation of alarms, but the detection is not interlocked to shut down the process equipment or initiate a discharge.  \nR3-5.2  A period of days or weeks may be appropriate depending on the effect of an accidental activation of the system in terms of interruption to processing, damage to product or contamination of the environment.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R3-6  Maintenance & Servicing\n\nR3-6.1  Once systems are installed and commissioned it is important that the routine inspection and maintenance procedures recommended by manufacturers and those required by codes and standards, are adequately implemented.  \nR3-6.2  The inspection frequencies may need to be modified if the ambient conditions can adversely affect the protection systems.  For example sprinkler heads protecting corrosive fume exhaust ducts may need to be inspected weekly or monthly until the appropriate frequency for that particular system can be determined.  \nR3-6.3  Annual and semi-annual maintenance should be carried out by competent personnel with adequate training for the tasks in hand.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # RELATED INFORMATION 4 DOCUMENTING EXPLOSION SAFETY FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT\n\nNOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI S14 and was derived from the work of a member of the Fire Protection Task Force of the North American Environmental, Health, and Safety Committee.

R4-1.2 This document is intended to assist equipment designers and third party evaluators in documenting the presence of explosion hazards and detailing how they have integrated explosion safety into the design. R4-1.3 There are specific requirements with regard to the prevention and mitigation of explosion risks within many jurisdictions. However the theory of explosion prevention and mitigation transcends jurisdictional boundaries. While this document arises out of the need for some equipment to satisfy the European Union ATEX Directive (94/9/EC), it has been developed in such as way that it will not only meet the requirement to document the principles of\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R4-1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R4-1  Introduction\n\nContent: integrated explosion safety (Essential Health and Safety Requirement 1.0), but will provide information to authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs) in many other parts of the world.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R4-2  Documentation\n\nR4-2.1  For all equipment using flammable liquids or gases an Explosion Risk Document (ERD) should be developed and issued as an appendix to the SEMI S14 Fire Risk Assessment Internal Report. (The main explosion hazards, risks and mitigation features should already be documented in the S14 Final and Summary Reports.)  \nR4-2.2  The ERD should demonstrate that the equipment designer and manufacturer have adopted an integrated approach to explosion safety adequately mitigating the risk of an explosion.  \nR4-2.3  The structure of the document is flexible, however a logical structure should be adopted such as that suggested by the headings and sections of this document, e.g.,  \nDesign Philosophy and Equipment Operation Overview,  \nHazard Identification,\nMitigation Measures Implemented & Protection Systems Integrated, and\nResidual Explosion Risk.\n\nSEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R4-3  Design Philosophy and Equipment Operation Overview (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S14-0704 SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R4-3  Design Philosophy and Equipment Operation Overview\n\nContent: R4-3.1 The intended purpose of the equipment should be stated, along with its operating environment. R4-3.2 A functional and technical overview of the process should be provided, where it relates to the flammable and explosive chemicals and gases. This should include significant process parameters including temperature, pressure, and quantities of relevant chemicals and gases. The operating conditions and control system faults that influence explosion safety should be described. R4-3.3 The explosion protection design philosophy should be thoroughly documented listing the design standards applied, and any significant deviations. R4-3.4 The classification of hazardous areas or zoning outside and inside equipment should be described indicating the classification system used (e.g., EN1127- 1, NFPA 497).
