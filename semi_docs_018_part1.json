The equipment manufacturer must provide unique names (CPNAMEs) for any supported command parameters. Command parameters are not specified in this document but are left to equipment manufacturers to define. Equipment models of specific classes of semiconductor equipment also may address this issue. Note that if there are no associated parameters a zero-length list is sent. The data item CEPVAL, which can be defined as a list, allows grouping of related parameters within a main parameter. If the CEPVAL is defined as a single (nonlist) item, then it is the equivalent of a CPVAL. The uses of OBJSPEC in the header structure of the S2,F49 Enhanced Remote Command allows the equipment supplier to define a set of unique identifiers for different objects within the equipment such as: equipment sub-systems, sub-system components, processing stations, ports, and exchange stations. 4.4.3\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: Description — The equipment responds to host commands that provide the following functions relative to individual equipment implementations: — Start processing — Select a process program or recipe — Stop processing — Temporarily suspend processing — Resume processing — Abort processing Additional commands may be implemented by the equipment manufacturer (e.g., vent chamber, clear material, open door). Remote commands shall be interpreted as “request action be initiated” rather than “do action.” The equipment may then respond via S2,F42/S2,F50 with $\\mathrm { H C A C K } ~ = ~ 4$ if the command “is going to be performed.” This alleviates any transaction timeouts for commands that may take a long time to perform. The completion of the action initiated by the remote command (i.e., $\\mathrm { H C A C K } = 0$ or 4) must result in either a state transition or other action that generates a collection event upon normal/abnormal completion. The format for all remote commands is ASCII, with a maximum length of\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: 20 characters. The character set is restricted to the printable characters (hexadecimal 21 through 7E). Note that spaces are not allowed. The following remote commands (RCMDs), if implemented on the equipment, shall be supported as described below (see Section 3.4 for a description of Equipment Processing States). NOTE 12: The terms “current cycle” and “safe break point” used below are to be defined by the supplier or within the models of classes of semiconductor equipment. START — This command is available to the host when a process program or recipe has been selected and the equipment is in the “ready” processing state. The START command instructs the equipment to initiate processing. Variable parameter settings may be included as name/value command parameters CPNAME/CPVAL/CEPVAL. PP-SELECT — This command instructs the equipment to make the requested process program(s) available in the execution area. The process programs (PPIDs) are specified via the command parameter list. A status variable\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: (PPExecName) contains the PPID of the process program(s) currently selected. RCP-SELECT — This command uses the Enhanced Remote Command S2,F49 to instruct the equipment to prepare the requested recipes for execution in the execution area. The recipes and variable parameters are specified via command parameter lists. Each recipe specification may be accompanied by new variable parameter settings, if any, in the command parameter list. A status variable RcpExecName contains the recipe specifiers or identifiers of the recipes currently selected. STOP — Command to complete the current cycle, stop in a safe condition and return to the “idle” processing state. Stop has the intent of stopping the process. The equipment is not required to support the continuation of processing. Stop leaves material either fully processed or partially processed so that the processing can be later completed. For example, for a single wafer process tool, five wafers have been processed while the remaining wafers remain\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: unprocessed. PAUSE Command to suspend processing temporarily at the next safe break point. Pause has the intent of resuming the process at the same point where it was paused. The process may be RESUMED, STOPPED, or ABORTED while in a PAUSED condition. RESUME shall be able to continue the process from the same point where it was paused. RESUME — Command to resume processing from the point where the process was paused. ABORT — Command to terminate the current cycle prior to its completion. Abort has the intent of immediately stopping the process and is used because of abnormal conditions. Abort makes no guarantee about the subsequent condition of material. In the above example, the wafers being processed at the time of the abort may not be completely processed. Other AbortLevels $> 1$ may be defined by the manufacturer or addressed by models of specific classes of semiconductor equipment. CPNAME $\\mathbf { \\sigma } = \\mathbf { \\sigma }$ AbortLevel, $\\mathbf { C P V A L } = 1$ means terminate current cycle\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: at the next “safe break point,” retrieve all material, stop in a safe condition and return to the idle state in the processing state machine.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.4  Requirements\n\nThe following Remote Commands, as defined under Descriptions, must be implemented on equipment to satisfy minimum requirements for this capability:  \n— START — STOP  \n— The RCMD value for all commands supported on the equipment must be recognized if sent with all upper-case characters (e.g., “STOP”, “START”, “PP-SELECT”, “PAUSE”, etc.). In addition to accepting strings with all upper-case characters, the equipment can optionally accept strings with all lower-case characters or mixed-case strings. The equipment documentation should describe whether or not the optional lower-case or mixed-case strings are supported.  \n— Stream 2 currently provides for Host Command Send and Enhanced Remote Command. The equipment shall support one or both methods, based on appropriateness.  \n— The Enhanced Remote Command is used to address size, complexity, or the need to target a specific subsystem within the equipment, (i.e., processing station, port, exchange station, material handler, chamber).\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.4.5.2  Enhanced Remote Command Scenario COMMENTS\n\nHOST EQUIPMENT  \nCOMMENT  \nEnhanced Remote Command  \n49--> <--S2,F50 EnhancedRemote Command Acknowledge [IF] Command Accepted (HCACK $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\mathit { \\Theta } 0$ or 4) <--S6,F11 [THEN] Event Report-state change or other collection event occurrence.  \nEvent Report Acknowledge S6,F12-->\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.5  Equipment Constants\n\n4.5.1  Purpose — This capability provides a method for the host to read and to change the value of selected equipment constants on the equipment.  \n4.5.2  Definitions — None.  \n4.5.3  Description — This capability allows the host to reconfigure equipment constants to support a variety of situations. The following functions are included:  \nHost Sends Equipment Constants — Allows the host to change the value of one or more equipment constants.  \nHost Equipment Constant Request — Allows the host to determine the current value of equipment constants.  \nHost Equipment Constant Namelist Request — Allows the host to retrieve basic information about the equipment constants available at the equipment.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.5.4  Requirements\n\n— Equipment constants must be stored in non-volatile memory.  \n— The equipment must be in a “safe” condition to accept new constant(s) settings as defined by the equipment manufacturer.  \n— The equipment must provide a collection event to alert the host whenever an equipment constant is changed by the operator.

Process Program Identifier — A text string (PPID) used to identify a process program. Formatted Process Program — A process program that is presented as an ordered sequence of command codes with their associated parameters as dictated by S7,F23, and S7,F26. Where formatted process programs are supported, equipment must also provide information sufficient to allow a user at the host to create, display, modify, and partially verify their contents (for example, that information provided in S7,F22). Unformatted Process Program — An unformatted process program is transferred without structure as the single data item PPBODY (refer to SEMI E5 for a complete description of PPBODY). Process\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.1 Definitions for Process Programs (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.1 Definitions for Process Programs\n\nContent: Program Change Event — The collection event associated with the occurrence of the creation, modification, or deletion of a process program by the operator. PPChangeName — A data value (DVVAL) containing the PPID of the process program affected by the event Process Program Change Event. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable data item.

Verification\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.1 Definitions for Process Programs (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.1 Definitions for Process Programs\n\nContent: ensures only that a process program is structured correctly. It does not ensure that the program has the correct parameters to run a particular process or product (see Process Program Validation). Equipment supporting unformatted process programs should provide a variable DVVAL PPError that provides information to the user concerning the error or errors when an attempt to verify a process program fails. NOTE 14: It may not be possible for the equipment to verify unformatted process programs other than to check the size of the program and internal program checksums. Equipment has no standard means of indicating the type of error encountered in an unformatted process program. Process Program Validation — Validation is type-andrange checking of parameters in a process program, and is performed after verification.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes\n\nContent: Execution recipe — A type of recipe stored by the equipment for purposes of editing, verification, and execution. For complete definitions of execution recipes and their standard attributes, see SEMI E42, Section 6. Execution Recipe Change Event — The collection event associated with the occurrence of the modification or deletion of an execution recipe stored by the equipment. Note 15: A recipe is modified whenever its body is changed New Execution Recipe Event — The collection event associated with the creation of a new execution recipe at the equipment. Object form recipe — A recipe with body in a proprietary format that may be presented without structure. RcpChangeName — A data value (DVVAL) containing the identifier of the recipe affected by the event Execution Recipe Change Event or New Execution Recipe Event. See the SEMI E5 Standard for a full definition of this variable data item. RcpChangeStatus — The action taken on the recipe named by RcpChangeName. This variable is valid for\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes\n\nContent: the collection event Execution Recipe Change Event or New Execution Recipe Event. See the SEMI E5 Standard for a full definition of this variable data item. RcpExecName — The status variable containing the specifiers of the currently selected recipe(s). See the SEMI E5 Standard for a full definition of this variable data item. RCP-SELECT — The remote command used to select one or more recipes for execution. See Section 4.4.3. Recipe Attribute — Information about the recipe that is transferred with the recipe as a name/value pair. The value may be a single item or a list. Recipe — A recipe contains both a set of instructions, settings, and parameters that the equipment uses to determine the processing environment (its body or process program) and a set of attributes that provide information about the recipe, such as the date and time the body was last changed. SEMI E42 defines two types of recipes: managed recipes and execution recipes. For purposes of GEM, the term recipe refers to an\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes\n\nContent: execution recipe only. Recipe identifier — A recipe identifier is a formatted text string (RCPID) used to identify the recipe. Recipe specifier — A formatted text string (RCPSPEC) used in messages to indicate a specific recipe. A recipe specifier includes the recipe identifier. It may also include additional information, such as the name of the specific component of the equipment where the recipe is to be executed (e.g. a process chamber) and the name of a recipe repository on the host. Recipe Verification — Verification is syntax checking of a recipe’s body. Verification ensures that a recipe body is structured correctly and has the correct syntax. It may also provide a check of semantics. It does not ensure that the body has the correct parameters to run a particular process or product (see Recipe Validation). NOTE 16: Unverified recipes shall be verified upon download. Recipe Validation — Validation is type-and-range checking of parameters in a recipe, and is performed when the recipe\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes\n\nContent: is selected for execution. The recipe may be correct in its syntax and semantics but should fail validation if it can not be executed with the current equipment configuration. Source form recipe — A recipe with a body that is presented as an ordered sequence of text. A source form recipe may be created and edited off-line to the equipment. Definition of syntax requirements shall be documented, in order to allow proper off-line editing. Variable Parameters — Variable parameters are recipe parameters that are defined in the body of the recipe and whose run-time values may be set outside of the recipe when the recipe is selected for execution and/or when processing is started. Both the host and the operator may specify new settings as a parameter name/value pair. Variable Parameter Definition — A variable parameter definition has three parts: the name of the variable parameter, its default setting, and restrictions on the run-time value selected. Variable parameter definitions are stored in\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.2.2  Definitions for Recipes\n\nContent: the recipe attribute “Parameters”.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.1 Process Program Description (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.1 Process Program Description\n\nContent: Process programs allow the equipment’s process, and/or the parameters used by that process, to be set and modified by the engineer to achieve different results. Different process programs maybe required for different products, while often the same process program will be used for all lots of a given product. The engineer must be able to create such programs, to modify current programs, and to delete programs from equipment storage. For the host to ensure that the proper process programs are in place at the equipment, there must be a means of transferring them from equipment to host and from host to equipment. The host also may need to delete process programs from the equipment’s storage to make room for a process program to be downloaded. In addition, the host must be kept informed whenever a local change occurs in the contents or status of a process program. Both formatted and unformatted process programs may be uploaded and downloaded. This capability provides for both host- and\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.1 Process Program Description (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.1 Process Program Description\n\nContent: equipment-initiated transfers. The equipment-initiated transfer may be used at the request of the process engineer or operator at the equipment. If a process program exists with the same PPID as the one given in the SECS-II message, the old process program must be replaced. The PPID in the e process program in non-volatile storage.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.2 Recipe Description (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.2 Recipe Description\n\nContent: Specifications in Section 4.6.3.1 apply to recipes as well as process programs, with the following differences: A recipe contains a body corresponding to a process program. In addition, it contains attributes defined for execution recipes in SEMI E42, Section 6. Recipe attributes are transferred whenever the recipe is downloaded or uploaded. The same SECS-II messages are used for all execution recipes, regardless of the internal structure of the recipe body. If an execution recipe already exists with the same identifier as the one given in the SECS-II message, the downloaded recipe shall be rejected (not stored) unless the host has specified a “forced overwrite” in the data item RCPOWCODE. A recipe currently being edited shall be protected from inadvertent change or overwriting by a recipe with the same identifier that is downloaded during this time. If the downloaded recipe is accepted (stored), the equipment shall require the operator either to save the edited recipe to a new (unused)\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.2 Recipe Description (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.2 Recipe Description\n\nContent: identifier or to discard it. For the equipment to initiate either an upload or download of a recipe, it shall request the host to initiate an upload or download procedure. In addition, it may be necessary to also specify the name of the repository (recipe namespace) at the host.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.3 Large Process Programs and Recipes (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.3 Large Process Programs and Recipes\n\nContent: 4.6.3.3.1 Process programs and recipes for certain types of equipment, such as metrology or inspection equipment, contain images and are, therefore, very large. Such process programs and recipes cannot fit into a single multi-block SECS-II message that has a maximum theoretical size of 7,995,148 text bytes. Furthermore, process programs and recipes may also require some preparation prior to transfer. 4.6.3.3.2 The commonly used Stream 7 and Stream 15 transfer functions require that the entire process program be sent in a single message. Thus, it is not possible to send a large process program or recipe with such messages. However, there is an alternative set of Stream 7 and Stream 15 functions that supports large transfers. These messages invoke Stream 13 Data Set Transfer Protocol messages to transfer large process programs (or recipes) by using a sequence of read messages. The completion of such a read transaction is indicated by “ERROR: End of Data”. The Data Set Transfer\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.3 Large Process Programs and Recipes (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.3.3 Large Process Programs and Recipes\n\nContent: Protocol does not set any limit on the size of the data set.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.4  Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.4  Requirements\n\nContent: The equipment manufacturer shall provide a method to create, modify, and delete process programs or recipes. This method shall exist on either the equipment or on a separate computing system. A CEID shall be defined for a collection event for the creation, the deletion, or the modification (completion of an editing session) of a process program (Process Program Change Event). For recipes, there are two separate CEIDs and collection events, one for the creation of a new recipe (New Execution Recipe Event) and one when a recipe is changed or deleted (Execution Recipe Change Event). A New Execution Recipe Event shall occur whenever a new recipe identifier is created through download, edit, copy, or rename operations. A Execution Recipe Change Event shall occur whenever the body of an existing recipe is modified. The name (identifier) that the engineer or operator uses to refer to the process program or recipe is the same as the identifier used by the host. Upon request from the host or operator, the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.4  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.4  Requirements\n\nContent: equipment shall perform the following actions with regard to process programs and recipes stored in non-volatile storage: upload, download, delete, and list current equipment process program or recipe directory. The equipment shall be able to store in non-volatile memory the number of process programs or recipes sufficient to execute three unique process cycles. For example, if a wire-bonder requires both an “ALIGN” process program and a “BOND” process program for a full process cycle, then it must provide non-volatile storage for at least three pairs of process programs. These stored process programs or recipes may not be modified in any way by the execution process, nor may the execution process be affected by the modification of any process program or recipes in storage, either by downloading or by local editing, while that process program or recipes is being executed. The equipment must provide verification and validation of all downloaded process programs and recipes. • Stream 7 provides for\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.4  Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.6.4  Requirements\n\nContent: formatted and unformatted process programs, while Stream 15 provides for recipes. The equipment must support at least one of these three methods. The equipment supplier shall document any restrictions on the length or test format of PPID. The maximum length allowed by equipment may be less than that allowed by SECS-II. Where recipes are supported, the following requirements also apply: The variable PPFormat shall be provided to indicate to the user the messages supported by the equipment.

Time stamping is\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS\n\nContent: useful for resolving relative order of event/alarm occurrences and scheduling of equipment activities by the host. The ability for the host to instruct the equipment to set an internal clock to a specified time value, and for the equipment to request the current date and time, is needed for effective time management and synchronization between host and equipment.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.2  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.2  Definitions\n\nContent: Clock — Clock is a status variable containing the current value of time at the equipment. Clock may be included in report definitions and/or queried separately by the host. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable data item and its required formatting. TIME — TIME is a data item contained in messages used by the host to set time at the equipment and by the equipment or host to request the current time from the other. (See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this data item.) 4.10.3 Detailed Description — The clock capability assumes the existence of a relative time reference on the equipment. This time reference is used as a basis for updating the time value of an equipment status variable called “Clock.” The time reference must reflect the current time to within a resolution range of seconds to centiseconds (refer to the format for Clock in the SEMI E5 Standard). The purpose of time stamping with centiseconds is to resolve the order in which nearly simultaneous events occur rather than to\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.2  Definitions\n\nContent: provide a more precise record of the time of day at which they occurred. Where more than one event occurs within a given period of clock resolution, the centiseconds reported in the time stamps for these events must reflect the actual order in which the events were detected. Equipment with a clock resolution of less than a second should report centiseconds. Otherwise, centiseconds should be assigned to reflect the relative order in which events were detected. Equipment unable to resolve time to less than a second and unable to reflect the relative order in which events were detected may report centiseconds as $^ { 6 6 } 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The host employs the “Date and Time Set Request” message (S2,F31) to initialize the value of Clock to the value contained in the TIME data item. Similarly, the equipment may employ the “Date and Time Request“ message (S2,F17) to obtain a new initialization time for Clock. As before, the value of TIME returned by the host is used to set Clock. Note, in the event that\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.2  Definitions\n\nContent: the precision of TIME is seconds and that for Clock is centiseconds, in both cases the initial value of Clock shall contain $^ { 6 4 } 0 0 ^ { 3 }$ for its Centisecond digits upon initialization. Additionally, for any field in TIME that is not supported by the equipment, the local value of this field is equipment dependent. For example, Equipment that cannot resolve time to less than a second might round or ignore centiseconds and always set the Centisecond field to $^ { \\mathrm { * } } \\mathrm { 0 0 ^ { \\mathrm { * } } }$ .\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.4  Requirements\n\nThe resolution and update rate of the internal time reference must be sufficient to distinguish between two nearly simultaneous collection events and/or alarms.  \nThe equipment supplier shall provide documentation describing the resolution of the internal time reference.  \n— The equipment supplier shall provide documentation describing how centisecond values are assigned, including the case of unresolvable simultaneous events.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.10.5  Scenarios\n\nEquipment Requests TIME (Optional Scenario):  \nCOMMENTS  \nHOST EQUIPMENT  \nHost responds with a TIME value S2,F18-->  \n<--S2,F17  \nEquipment requests a time value from the host.  \nEquipment sets its internal time reference to the value of TIME received from the host.  \nHost Instructs Equipment to Set Time:\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS\n\nContent: HOST EQUIPMENT COMMENTS Host instructs equipment to set its time.

S2,F17--> <--S2,F18 Equipment returns its internal time reference value to the host. 4.11 Spooling — Spooling is a capability whereby the equipment can queue messages intended for the host during times of communication failure and subsequently deliver these messages when communication is restored. Spooling is limited to primary messages of user-selected streams. 4.11.1 Purpose — The purpose of spooling is to provide a method for retaining equipment message data that might otherwise be lost due to communication failure. The motive for producing this functionality is to retain valuable data used to track material and to improve product quality. The spooling capability fills a gap in the SEMI E5 standard. In the past,\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS\n\nContent: without a spooling capability, the equipment has typically discarded messages that could not be delivered, or turned messaging off altogether. It is intended that the host initiate the spool unload process immediately following the reestablishment of communications.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.11.2  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.11.2  Definitions\n\nContent: MaxSpoolTransmit — An equipment constant containing the maximum number of messages that the equipment shall transmit from the spool in response to an S6,F23 “Transmit Spooled Messages” request. If MaxSpoolTransmit is set to zero, no limit is placed on the messages sent from the spool. Multi-block inquire/grant messages are not counted in this total. OverWriteSpool — A boolean equipment constant used to indicate to the equipment whether to overwrite data in the spool area or to discard further messages whenever the spool area limits are exceeded. Send Queue — Refers to the queue into which equipment generated SECS messages are placed in preparation for transmission to the host. Spool — The spool is an area of non-volatile storage in which the equipment stores certain messages that cannot be delivered to the host (when the equipment is in the NOT COMMUNICATING substate of COMMUNICATIONS ENABLED). The spool area can be thought of as a sequential “ring” buffer. The term spool is also used to denote the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.11.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.11.2  Definitions\n\nContent: action of placing messages into the spool area. SpoolCountActual — A status variable used to keep a count of the messages actually stored in the equipment’s spool area. Multi-block inquire/grant messages are not spooled and not included in this count. SpoolCountTotal — A status variable used to keep a count of the total number of primary messages directed to the spool, regardless of whether placed or currently retained in the spool. Multi-block inquire/grant messages are not spooled and not included in this count. SpoolFullTime — A status variable containing the timestamp when the spool last became full. If the spool was not filled during the last spooling period, this will contain a time value prior to the current SpoolStartTime. SpoolStartTime — A status variable containing the timestamp from when spooling was last activated.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.11.3  Description\n\n4.11.3.1  Spooling State Model — There are two major states of spooling: SPOOL INACTIVE and SPOOL ACTIVE. SPOOL ACTIVE has two components: SPOOL UNLOAD and SPOOL LOAD. These are each broken into substates. A description of all spooling states, substates, and applicable state transitions follows. The POWER OFF and POWER ON parent states are common to all equipment subsystems. They are shown here to illustrate the retention of spooling context during a power down situation.  \nNOTE 20: Disabling SECS communications does not affect the current spooling state since no messages are generated until communications are subsequently enabled. Spooling is effectively frozen in this case.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # POWER OFF\n\nThe equipment has lost power for any reason (e.g., power failure, power switch set to off).  \nPOWER ON  \nThe equipment is powered up.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL INACTIVE\n\nThis is the normal operating mode. No spooling occurs. The spool area is empty. Primary SECS-II messages are transmitted normally.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL ACTIVE\n\nAll primary SECS-II messages ready for sending and for which spooling is enabled (see S2,F43) are directed to the spool area. All other primary messages, except Stream 1, are discarded. The equipment shall attempt to send any secondary messages that are generated and discard these messages should the attempt to send fail.  \nSpool state transitions from SPOOL INACTIVE to SPOOL ACTIVE if the communications state changes from COMMUNICATING to NOT COMMUNICATING (Communication State Transition Table, #14) or from WAIT CRA to WAIT DELAY (Communication STATE Transition Table, #6).  \nOnce communications are established, the host must initiate the spool unload sequence to restore full functionality (see below). Since the equipment will deliver secondary messages, the host may inquire for information or send commands as needed.  \nThe SPOOL ACTIVE state has two AND states: SPOOL LOAD and SPOOL UNLOAD. This means that they operate independently, though sharing data and some state change stimuli. See Section 3.1 for explanation of state model terms and notation.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL LOAD\n\nThe SPOOL LOAD component enters messages into the spool area. It is divided into two substates: SPOOL NOT FULL and SPOOL FULL. SPOOL NOT FULL is the default entry substate of the parent state SPOOL LOAD.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL NOT FULL\n\nAs primary SECS-II messages are directed to the spool area, the equipment shall “write” the SECS-II message to the end of the spool. Status variables SpoolCountTotal and SpoolCountActual shall be incremented each time a message is placed in the spool area.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL FULL (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL FULL\n\nContent: In this state, all of the allocated spooling area is filled. Choice of the following options shall be controlled by the setting of a Boolean equipment constant called “OverWriteSpool.” The first message to be dealt with is that which could not be fit into the spool prior to transition from SPOOL NOT FULL (see transition table below). OverWriteSpool is True: The equipment deletes as many of the “oldest” records (e.g., SECS-II messages) contained in the spool area necessary to make space for the new message and then adds the message. Status variable SpoolCountTotal shall be incremented whenever a message is submitted to the spool area. Status variable SpoolCountActual shall be manipulated to keep an accurate count of the number of messages contained in the spool area. For example, if it is necessary to delete three messages in the spool area to spool one message, SpoolCountActual would have three subtracted and then one added to the total. OverWriteSpool is False: Any subsequent primary messages shall be\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL FULL (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL FULL\n\nContent: discarded. When such a message is discarded, SpoolCountTotal is incremented.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # SPOOL UNLOAD\n\nThe SPOOL UNLOAD component of SPOOLACTIVE deals with movement of messages out of the spool. It has an active substate (SPOOL OUTPUT) and a passive substate (NO SPOOL OUTPUT). NO SPOOL OUTPUT is the default entry substate, since the equipment is NOT COMMUNICATING at the time spooling is initiated. When communications between equipment and host are restored, there is an opportunity for the host to recover spooled messages. No action is taken until the host initiates the spool output process via the S6,F23 (Request Spooled Data). The host has the option to either receive the spooled messages (see substate TRANSMIT SPOOL) or discard all messages in the spool (see substate PURGE SPOOL).\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NO SPOOL OUTPUT\n\nIn this state, no messages are removed from the spool.  \nSPOOL OUTPUT  \nThe SPOOL OUTPUT state encompasses the removal of messages from the spool. Its substates are TRANSMIT SPOOL and PURGE SPOOL.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL\n\nContent: The host elects to receive all messages contained in the spool area. The equipment is expected to keep track of the oldest record (i.e., message) within the spool area. When communications are re-established with the host and transmission of the spool area is started, the oldest record must be the first record transmitted, then the next oldest record, etc. There is no prioritization of messages to be sent from the spool. As each spooled message is successfully transmitted to the host, it is removed from the spool area upon successful completion of the transaction. SpoolCountActual is decremented as each message is removed from the spool. The equipment shall transmit messages only from the spool area until all spooled messages have been completely transmitted to the host. Flow control of the spool transmit process is achieved in two ways. First, only one open transaction on the equipment is allowed during spool unload. Thus, if a message requires a reply, the equipment shall wait for that reply before\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL\n\nContent: transmitting the next spooled message. Messages which require no reply may be transmitted sequentially as rapidly as the message transfer mechanism will allow. The second flow control method is to allow the host to limit the maximum number of messages sent from the spool in response to the S6,F23 request. An equipment constant named MaxSpoolTransmit may be set by the host to achieve this behavior. If MaxSpoolTransmit is set to five, for example, the equipment will send the first five messages from the spool and then transition to the NO SPOOL OUTPUT state, awaiting the next S6,F23 request. There is no event report generated when MaxSpoolTransmit is reached. The host is responsible for determining this situation by a) counting the messages received, b) timing out waiting for the next message, c) inquiring to the equipment for the curent value of the SpoolCountActual status variable, or d) some combination of the above. If MaxSpool-Transmit is set to zero, the spool shall be transmitted completely in response\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL\n\nContent: to S6,F23. Normal spooling continues during the spool transmit process. If the SPOOL LOAD component should transi-tion to SPOOL FULL, it shall not have any effect on the SPOOL UNLOAD component. Once full, the spool cannot make the transition back to SPOOL NOT FULL except via the SPOOL INACTIVE state. Space made available due to the spool unload process shall not be used in this case. When a multi-block message is to be transmitted from the spool, any required inquire/grant transaction shall be initiated. If the host’s response denies permission to send the multi-block message, the equipment shall discard that message and continue with the transmit process. This sequence shall count as one message in the MaxSpoolTransmit count. There is one area where SPOOL LOAD and SPOOL UNLOAD may interact: When the spool is full and OverWriteSpool is True. During the spool transmit process, spooled messages are being removed and new primary messages are being written to the spool. These new messages are overwriting the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # TRANSMIT SPOOL\n\nContent: oldest messages available, unless the unload process has freed sufficient spool space. There is a possibility that the unload and overwrite processes may compete for control of the same message area. For example, if the spool holds messages ABCDE, with A oldest and E newest, A might be sent to the host, B (and the space from A) overwritten by the new message F, C sent to the host, D and E (and the space from message C) overwritten by G, etc. The loss of continuity may be “disorienting” to the host program receiving the messages. It is expected that the unload process will be fast relative to the generation of new messages, so that this occurrence will be rare. Should a communication failure occur during the spool transmit process, spooling shall continue as before the transmit process began. However, the spool unload sequence shall terminate (i.e., transition to NO SPOOL OUTPUT will occur — see transition table below).\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # PURGE SPOOL (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # PURGE SPOOL\n\nContent: The equipment shall discard all messages in the spool and, when the spool is empty, zero SpoolCountActual. Spooling State Transitions A table follows detailing all spooling state transitions as presented in the state transition diagram. Table 4.11 Spooling State Transition 4.11.3.2 Enabling Spooling — The equipment shall provide the host with the ability to enable and disable Spooling for any message (except Stream 1 messages (i.e., S1,F1, S1,F13)) via the S2,F43/F44 transaction. Spooling may be enabled for an entire Stream, for individual messages within a stream, or for any combination of the two. Streams and Functions not referenced in this message are not spooled. Spooling can be totally disabled by sending an S2,F43 with a zero length list for the first item (see S2,F43 definition). In addition, the equipment shall provide an equipment constant, EnableSpooling, to allow setting the enable or disable of spooling. NOTE: When EnableSpooling is false, the SPOOL state cannot transition from SPOOLINACTIVE to\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # PURGE SPOOL (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # PURGE SPOOL\n\nContent: SPOOLACTIVE. Changing EnableSpooling does not change the spool state, purge the spool or change streams and functions enabled for spooling. Once the equipment is “SPOOL ACTIVE”, the host must initiate the spool unload sequence to restore full functionality even though “Enable Spooling” has changed to false. 4.11.4 Requirements — The following items are required to support the spooling capability: — At a minimum, the equipment shall reserve for spooling non-volatile storage with sufficient capacity to store all of the primary SECS-II messages that would occur during a normal processing cycle. — While spooling is enabled, the equipment shall reply to primary messages sent by the host with the appropriate secondary message. Secondary messages which cannot be delivered shall be discarded, never spooled. — All spooling-related status variables and setup information (as per S2,F43) must be stored in nonvolatile memory along with any other information required for the potential unloading of the spool area after a\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # PURGE SPOOL (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # PURGE SPOOL\n\nContent: power loss. — Upon powerup, the equipment shall retain all spooling context from the time the equipment was last shutdown or reset. This means that spooling, if previously active, continues upon system powerup. The Equipment must reject any message that attempts to set “Spooling” for Stream 1. — If a multi-block primary message need for the inquire/grant is to be sent during SPOOL ACTIVE, the message should be placed in the spool and the grant resolved during spool transmit.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.11.5  Scenarios\n\nDefine the Set of Messages to be Spooled:  \nThis Scenario is used to set up the list of messages that the equipment should spool (or by defining none, to disable spooling).\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # COMMENTS\n\nContent: HOST EQUIPMENT COMMENTS Host defines messages to be S2,F43--> spooled in case of communications failure. <--S2,F44 Equipment acknowledges setup.

No messages are added to the Spool during the transmit process. 4.12 Control — The control-related capabilities allow for configuration and manipulation of the control state model. In this way the host and/or user may modify the equipment’s control-related behavior. 4.12.1 Purpose — This section complements the CONTROL state model description found in Section 3.3. It defines the requirements for implementation of this model.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.12.3  Description (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.12.3  Description\n\nContent: 4.12.3.1 Control Configuration — The control state model has two areas of configuration. The first area is related to default entry states of the state model. Upon system initialization, the system must activate either the ON-LINE or OFF-LINE state. Upon entry to OFFLINE, the system must in turn activate one of the substates of OFF-LINE (EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE, ATTEMPT ON-LINE, or HOST OFF-LINE). In both these cases, the user shall configure the equipment to make the choices appropriate to that factory. Entry to the ON-LINE state also involves a choice of substates. In this case, the equipment reads the front panel REMOTE/LOCAL switch to determine the appropriate state. The second area of configuration involves the transition to be made if the ON-LINE attempt should fail. The model may be set to transition to either HOST OFFLINE or to EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE should the S1,F1 transaction be terminated unsuccessfully. Choosing HOST OFF-LINE allows the host to cause the equipment to transition to ON-LINE when the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.12.3  Description (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.12.3  Description\n\nContent: host becomes ready. This is accomplished via the message S1,F17 (see below). 4.12.3.2 Changing Control State — In the control state model, both the operator and the host can affect the control state. The operator retains ultimate authority to set the equipment OFF-LINE by means of an OFFLINE switch mechanism. The operator also can cause the equipment to attempt to go ON-LINE. Under some circumstances, the host can initiate the transition to ON-LINE. If the operator requests ON-LINE, the equipment will send an S1,F1 to the host. The host may confirm ON LINE with an S1,F2 or deny ON-LINE by sending an S1,F0.23 When the equipment is ON-LINE, the host may request that it transition to OFF-LINE. It will transition into the HOST OFF-LINE substate. When the equipment HOST OFF-LINE state is active, the host may request that it transition to ON-LINE. The combination of these two allow the host to cycle the equipment between ONLINE and OFF-LINE. Only the operator may change the ON-LINE substate (REMOTE or\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.12.3  Description (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.12.3  Description\n\nContent: LOCAL). via the operator console display.

# 8  GEM Compliance (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance\n\nContent: This section defines compliance to the GEM standard. It describes the fundamental GEM requirements and additional GEM capabilities. It provides references to other sections of the standard where detailed requirements are located. This section also defines standard terminology and documentation that can be used by equipment suppliers and device manufacturers to describe compliance with this standard. The GEM standard contains two types of specifications: — fundamental GEM requirements and — requirements pertaining to additional GEM capabilities. The fundamental GEM requirements form the foundation of the GEM standard. The additional GEM capabilities provide functionality required for some types of factory automation or functionality applicable to specific types of equipment. Figure 8.1 illustrates the relationship of the fundamental GEM requirements and the additional GEM capabilities. 8.1 Fundamental GEM Requirements All equipment shall comply with the fundamental GEM requirements listed in Table 8.1.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance\n\nContent: Compliance to these requirements involves precise and complete adherence to all sections of the GEM standard referenced in Table 8.1. Table 8.1 Fundamental GEM Requirements In addition, compliance requires adherence to the portions of the following sections that are applicable to the fundamental GEM requirements: — Variable data items (GEM, Section 5) — SECS-II data item restrictions (GEM, Section 5) — Collection events (GEM, Section 6) Vertical text represents capabilities. Some capabilitiesare also fundamental requirements. 8.2 GEM Capabilities — The following table lists all GEM capabilities and the sections of the GEM standard where they are specified. These sections contain the detailed requirements for implementing a GEM capability. Requirements for an individual capability include any referenced portions of the document. As an example, the Alarm Management capability requires implementation of the status variables “AlarmsEnabled” and “AlarmsSet” as defined in Section 5. Table 8.2 Section\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance\n\nContent: References for GEM Capabilities 8.3 Definition of GEM Compliance — The term “GEM Compliance” is defined with respect to individual GEM capabilities to indicate adherence to the GEM standard for a specific capability. Equipment is GEM-compliant for a specific GEM capability if, and only if, the following three criteria are met: — The fundamental GEM requirements are satisfied. — The capability is implemented to conform with all applicable definitions, descriptions, and requirements defined for the capability in this standard. The equipment does not exhibit behavior related to this capability that conflicts with the GEM behavior defined for the capability. For example, equipment that provides SECS-II messages for management of process programs must precisely implement the GEM Process Program Management capability to be “GEM-Compliant for Process Program Management.” Equipment may supply additional functionality not specified in the GEM standard by using any messages defined in the SECS-II standard as long\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance\n\nContent: as the additional functionality does not conflict with compliance to GEM capabilities. Figure 8.2 illustrates the host view of equipment communications in relationship to the components of the GEM standard. The GEM capabilities are built upon the fundamental GEM requirements and present GEMcompliant behavior to the host when they are not obstructed by conflicting functionality. Additional nonGEM capabilities and non-obstructing extensions to GEM capabilities provide additional functionality while maintaining GEM behavior from the host view. One additional term is defined to facilitate discussion of GEM capability. Equipment is “Fully GEM Capable” if and only if it meets the following two criteria: The equipment supplies all the GEM capabilities listed in Section 8.2. — Every implemented GEM capability is GEMCompliant. 8.4 Documentation This section describes documentation requirements in addition to those specified in Sections 3 and 4 of this standard. All documentation of the SECS-II interface shall be\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance\n\nContent: supplied as a single volume, including Message Documentation, a Compliance Statement and the documentation required by Sections 3 and 4. 8.4.1 Message Documentation — The equipment supplier shall provide message documentation in conformance with Chapter 8 (Message Documentation) of SEMI E5. 8.4.2 GEM Compliance Statement — The SECS-II interface documentation provided by an equipment supplier shall address GEM compliance. This documentation shall include a GEM Compliance Statement that accurately indicates for each capability whether it has been implemented and whether it has been implemented in a GEM-compliant manner. The format for this statement is supplied as Table 8.3. The table consists of three columns. The first column lists the requirements and capabilities. The other two columns pose questions to the supplier: Implemented: Does the equipment provide functionality that is similar to that defined for the GEM requirement or capability? GEM-Compliant: Has that requirement or capability been\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 8  GEM Compliance\n\nContent: implemented in a GEM-compliant manner? 8.4.3 The equipment supplier may provide documentation on the format of required data items (see Section 5) using SECS Message Language Notation $\\mathrm { \\langle S M L ^ { \\mathcal { P } } } ,$ ). The SML formats are provided in Table 8.4. Table 8.3 GEM Compliance Statement NOTE 1: Do not mark YES unless all fundamental GEM requirements are implemented and GEM-compliant.

The intent of having an Operational Script is to help put the SECS-II message Scenarios into a context. Although this context will vary, it represents a typical operational sequence found in most semiconductor device manufacturers’ applications. — System Initialization — Synchronization Machine Setup Production Setup Processing Post-Processing Shutdown The following script is not intended to be complete, but to serve as an example to be further developed on an implementation basis. A1.1 Anytime Capabilities All capabilities can generally occur at anytime during the operational script sequence. A1.2 System Initialization and Synchronization Upon system initialization, the default setting for communication (enabled or disabled) becomes effective, as well as any equipment constants or other information retained in non-volatile storage. The initial communication status is displayed at the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.1  Factory Operational Script (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.1  Factory Operational Script\n\nContent: equipment. Assuming the communication state is enabled, the equipment will attempt to establish communication with a host computer. See Section 4.1 for a description of the scenario for establishing communications. Upon receiving an indication that the equipment was previously not communicating, the host would typically perform synchronization activities including setting the equipment’s clock and requesting selected status information. Note that synchronization activity is host application-dependent and may be implemented using various scenarios. A1.3 Production Set-Up The host typically has the following information: what material what process step what process program to use (PPID) current equipment status, VID’s, SVID’s data collection requirements (trace data & event data) VID’s needed Equipment constants (ECID’s) Based upon the above information, the host will perform setup activities as required. It must be verified that the correct process program is available and selected at the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.1  Factory Operational Script (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.1  Factory Operational Script\n\nContent: equipment. A1.3.1 Auxiliary Material and Manual Set-Up Auxiliary material can be checked and verified at this point. If status variables exist for auxiliary material, they may be requested by the host. Any other manual, non-process, and/or non-product specific set-up also may take place at this point. The operator may interact with the equipment and the host. If the operator interacts with the equipment, the equipment communications link with the host should stay operational. The operator and the host may exchange information via equipment terminal services. A1.3.2 Product/Process Set-Up Specific product and/or process information is communicated to the equipment prior to processing material. A1.3.3 Material Load The host may instruct an operator or a material handling system to deliver material to the equipment. Once the material has arrived at the equipment, the equipment or the operator will notify the host. A1.3.4 Production Data Collection Set-Up The host instructs the equipment to\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.1  Factory Operational Script (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.1  Factory Operational Script\n\nContent: collect event-based data. Reports are defined and linked to events. Event reports can be enabled or disabled. The host instructs the equipment to collect data from the equipment based on time intervals. The host configures the equipment to monitor specific variables and to send event reports when variables transition between monitoring zones.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A1.4  Processing\n\nA1.4.1  Start Process Executing  The host or operator issues a command to start.  \nA1.4.2  Equipment Signals End of Run  When process execution is completed, the equipment generates events. If any of the events are enabled, they will be sent as event reports.  \nA1.5  Post-Processing The equipment has completed processing material. It now makes the material available to the operator or material handling system for removal. The equipment signals the host that it is available for more work.  \nA1.5.1  Material Unload  Material is unloaded from the equipment by an operator or material handling system.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.2  Equipment Front Panel (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.2  Equipment Front Panel\n\nContent: In the GEM standard, several requirements are stated that involve the display or input of information at the equipment front panel. The “equipment front panel” refers to an area on the equipment that is available to the operator under normal use (i.e., without removing maintenance access panels). This may include a CRT display, keyboard, switches, and lights. This application note provides some guidance for implementation of the GEM front panel capabilities. All of these requirements map directly to state models and capabilities defined in Sections 3 and 4. All capabilities may be implemented in either hardware (buttons, switches, lights) or in a software/CRT equivalent. A2.1 Displays and Indicators The intent of various displays is to inform the operator of either the current state of the equipment or of a recent change of state (or both). Therefore, it is most useful if these displays are continuously visible and easily recognized at a distance. Required displays/indicators include:\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.2  Equipment Front Panel (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.2  Equipment Front Panel\n\nContent: Communications State: This means that three distinct states must be represented: DISABLED, ENABLED/NOT COMMUNICATING, and ENABLED/COMMUNICATING. Terminal Services: An “New Host Message” indicator must be supplied. A2.2 Switches/Buttons Note that discrete switches also contain information for the user. However, these tend to represent the desired states of the operator/user. The equipment’s response to a change of a switch may not be instantaneous. Still, the current position of switches should be available to the operator. It may be appropriate to limit the access to some switches and buttons. This might be done via any of the standard methods, keys, passwords, combinations, etc. This is especially true for system default switches that would not often be changed. Required switches/buttons include: Communications State System Default: In what communications state should the equipment be when system initialization is complete? The choices are DISABLED and ENABLED.

Nor is there the expectation that the host can necessarily prevent or directly address such alarms.

Statecharts depict the behavior of a system by showing states it may take, events that prompt a change of state, and the composition of states. What follows is a very brief description of the symbols defined for use and how these are useful to describe a system. See Figure A.5.1 for the basic notational symbols. Figure A.5.1 Harel Statechart Symbols States are represented by rounded boxes. A state transition is shown graphically with a line from the old state terminating with the arrow symbol at the new state. Transitions are unidirectional-while the reverse transition may be possible, it is considered a different transition with different conditions for initiation and different resultant actions. States may be subdivided into substates to facilitate more concise definition of behavior. Thus, a hierarchy is defined whereby any state may be a substate\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation\n\nContent: of some parent state and in turn be the parent of its own substates. Substates must be one of two types, termed AND substates and OR substates. A parent maybe divided into two or more OR substates of which one and only one is the active substate at any time. The accepted term for this exclusivity is XOR. Figure A.5.2 gives an example of a simple case of OR substates. In this example, some system (perhaps a motor) has a state named FUNCTIONAL. When the motor is FUNCTIONAL, it may be either ON or OFF, but never both. Figure A.5.2 Example of OR Substates Another way of dividing a parent state corresponds roughly to subsystems. These AND substates represent parallelism, such that every AND substate of an active parent state is considered active. Harel also uses the term “Orthogonal Component” to refer to AND substates. However, these parallel substates tend to be highly interactive and interdependent. For this reason, the word orthogonal is considered confusing and has been excluded from use in this\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation\n\nContent: document. Figure A.5.3 shows an example of AND substates representing (in part) an automobile. Note the convention of attaching the name of the parent state AUTOMOBILE to the outside of the state in a small box. The substates shown are independent components and may have their own substates (of either the AND or OR type): LIGHTS may be ON or OFF; DOOR may be OPEN or CLOSED; ENGINE is constructed of components such as pumps, pistons, carburetor, etc. Exiting one of a set of AND substates requires the exit of all others. In some cases, a transition arrow will be shown from only one of the substates with the others implied. Figure A.5.3 Example of AND Substates A simplification that also helps to prevent in determinacy is implemented with the symbol for default entry point. This symbol will indicate which OR substate is initially active when there is not an explicit choice. This lack of specification is indicated by a transition arrow from one state to another that does not cross the boundary of the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation\n\nContent: parent to point specifically to a substate. An entrance to a state terminating in a history symbol (see Figure A.5.1) indicates that the OR substate to be entered should be that which was active the last time the parent state was active (i.e., last time the car was running, the radio was on). The history symbol H refers to the choice of substates of the parent. The symbol $\\mathrm { H ^ { * } }$ extends further to the lowest level substates defined. In the absence of memory of a “last time”, the default entry is used. The selector and conditional selector symbols serve to abbreviate complex entrances to states. Their meaning is similar and indicate that the choice of OR substate upon entry of a parent state depends on some condition that is not shown. The selector is usually used to combine several similar transition events, while the conditional selector will typically require some computation or test of conditions external to the stimulus for state transition. Please examine the referenced article\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.5  Harel Notation\n\nContent: for more detail. NOTE: Within the body of this document, the term statechart is not used in favor of the more traditional term state diagram. A5.1 State Definitions –– The state diagram provides a concise description of the function of a system. However, a full definition requires detail that cannot be included on the diagram. A description of each state is required that covers the boundaries of the state and any responses that occur within that state to the environment. The convention in this document is to provide state names in ALL CAPS to help the reader identify where these are used. A sample state description of the ON state depicted in the Figure A.5.2 might be:\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON\n\nContent: The switch is in the on position. Power is available to the motor. Speed of the motor will change in proportion to the speed knob adjustment. A5.2 Transition Table –– The last piece of the state model is the transition table. It consists of several columns that list the transition number from the diagram, the starting and ending state for the transition, and three columns titled trigger, action, and comment. The trigger column describes the combination of events and conditions that initiates the transition (e.g., message Sx,Fy received). The trigger should be related to a single clearly defined event at the equipment. The action column identifies the activities associated directly with the transition. These activities may be of three types: a) actions taken upon exit of the old state, b) actions taken upon entry to the new state, and c) actions not associated with either state. These are not differentiated in this document. The final column allows for additional comments that help to clarify the transition.

A host system must have a view of the control model to understand and predict equipment behavior. However, the implementor may simplify the host’s view by assuming that some configuration settings are fixed and that the host-initiated features are not implemented. Applying these assumptions simplifies the behavior the host expects to see. Figure A.6.1 shows the effective control model24 based on the following host assumptions: The fundamental requirements are met, but the additional host-intiated control capability is not implemented. The configuration for the default entry to CONTROL is set to an OFF-LINE substate (either ATTEMPT ON-LINE or EQUIPMENT OFFLINE). The destination state for transition 4 (failure of S1,F1 transaction) is configured to EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE. Figure A.6.1 Example of the Simplified “Effective” Control Model This view of the model has two further settings that the host\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.6  Example Control Model Application (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.6  Example Control Model Application\n\nContent: recognizes as changeable at the equipment. The first is the configuration of which substate of OFF LINE to be activated upon system initialization. The second is the front panel switch that determines whether the active system substate is LOCAL or REMOTE when ON-LINE. This application has the following implications: This application requires that the equipment begin with the OFF-LINE state active. Thus, an equipment initiated S1,F1/F2 transaction must be completed before the equipment will begin sending all messages to the host. If a failed attempt to go ON-LINE is made by the equipment, it will not allow the host to complete the transition at a later time. An operator will be required to re-initiate the transition to ON-LINE when the host becomes ready. Once ON-LINE, the equipment will remain ONLINE until an operator sets the equipment OFFLINE at the equipment front panel. Since all transitions into the HOST OFF-LINE state are eliminated, this state is effectively eliminated from\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.6  Example Control Model Application (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A.6  Example Control Model Application\n\nContent: the host view of the control model. This application retains the following features: The ON-LINE state is achieved only after the host acknowledges the equipment by replying to the S1,F1 with and S1,F2. This confirms to the operator attempting to put the equipment ON-LINE that the host application is ready for work to begin. It provides the operator the means to set the equipment OFF-LINE for non-host-related activities25 (e.g., maintenance, test lots). The operator has the ability to operate the equipment with either the REMOTE or LOCAL state active. As the equipment transitions to ONLINE, the preferred substate is automatically chosen (based on a front panel switch). The user may configure which substate of OFFLINE the equipment will initially activate at system initialization. If ATTEMPT ON-LINE is chosen, the equipment will automatically attempt the transition to the ON-LINE state as system initialization.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.1  Introduction\n\nA7.1.1  Four limits monitoring examples are included below to help clarify the use of limits and to illustrate typical applications.  The first example shows how to apply limits to boolean values. The second illustrates application of several limits to a floating point variable in a classical control zone style. The third example shows an integer counter variable used to prompt for equipment maintenance.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.1  Example 1 –– Valve Monitoring (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.1  Example 1 –– Valve Monitoring\n\nContent: A7.2.1.1 The ACME Shine-Um-Rite Model 13 includes a sump which contains the chemical agent used to clean bare wafers. A chemical feeder system serves to refill the sump when the level drops below a certain level. The fill is accomplished via an on-off value driven by sensors in the sump. Facilities must be informed of the proportion of the time the valve is open (approximates usage) and any time the value remains open for more than 5 minutes (valve likely broken). A7.2.1.2 To implement this requirement, a limit was defined for the Boolean status variable which contains the current state of the valve (i.e., $0 = { \\mathrm { C l o s e d } }$ , $1 =$ Open). See Figure A7.1 for illustration. LIMITID1 was defined with $\\mathrm { U P P E R D B } = \\mathrm { L I M I T M A X } = 1$ (Open) and LO $\\mathrm { \\Delta W E R D B } = \\mathrm { L I M I T M I N } = 0$ (Closed). As a result, any time the valve opens, a collection event is generated with TransitionType $= 0$ and when the valve closes, a\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.1  Example 1 –– Valve Monitoring (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.1  Example 1 –– Valve Monitoring\n\nContent: collection event is generated with TransitionType $\\mathbf { \\Psi } = \\mathbf { \\Psi } 1$ . An event report containing the DVVAL LimitVariable was attached to each collection event and reporting for the event was enabled. NOTE: Boolean values are defined as $\\begin{array} { r l } { 0 } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ False/Closed/Off and any value $> 0 = \\mathrm { T r u e / O p e n / O n } -$ never depend on a value of 1.

The environmental control system of this equipment is designed to hold the internal temperature relatively constant, but is sensitive to large changes in the external environment, opening of access doors, etc. To ensure that processing conditions are appropriate, the internal stepper temperature is monitored to ensure it remains in a safe operating zone (within “Shutdown” limits). In addition, a second set of limits are used within the Shutdown limits to bound the “Normal” operating range. Frequent excursions from the normal range into the “warning” range will prompt service on the environmental control system. The target temperature range is specified as $9 8 { \\scriptstyle - 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } }$ , the shutdown limits as $9 5 \\substack { - 1 0 3 ^ { \\circ } }$ A7.2.2.2 Event reports are desired when the internal temperature moves outside of the normal operating zone into a warning zone (above or below), when the temperature moves back\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.2  Example 2 –– Environment Monitoring (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.2  Example 2 –– Environment Monitoring\n\nContent: into the normal operating zone from the warning zones, and when the temperature moves out of the warning zones into the shutdown zones. Furthermore, temperature fluctuations of $0 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ should not trigger multiple event reports. A7.2.2.3 Probably the most intuitive use of the limits monitoring capability is in establishing normal, warning, and shutdown zones for a particular equipment variable. Limits may be combined to provide such a scenario. The method is described below and illustrated in Figure A7.2. Please note that in the figure, limits are denoted as solid lines for simplicity, with deadbands indicated using the $\\pm$ notation.

This machine includes redundant chambers to increase throughput. One particular chamber on this equipment requires periodic calibration. The need for calibration is a non-linear function of the number of wafers processed in that chamber. A status variable exists which contains the number of wafers processed since the last calibration was performed. Maintenance is definitely required after every 8 cycles, but the machine must be checked after 5 and 7 cycles to determine whether early calibration is necessary. This checking may be done by examining certain other equipment status variables. A7.2.3.2 To meet this need, three limits are defined for the counter variable. Three limits were set, at 5, 7, and 8. Deadbands are set to zero, since chattering is not a problem. All the pertinent information is placed in an event report which is attached to the CEID for the limits of the counter to negate the need for further\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.3  Example 3 –– Calibration Counter (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.3  Example 3 –– Calibration Counter\n\nContent: message exchange. Event reports are generated as each limit is reached (one zone transition each), and when the counter is reset following calibration (one, two, or three zone transitions referenced in one report). Figure A7.3 illustrates this example. Note that disabling the report upon counter reset (downward transitions) is not possible.

This is a vertical furnace which exposes wafers to a variety of temperatures during processing. The temperature profile during the run is critical to the process and is typically contains a number of plateau’s at different levels during the run. The owner wishes to monitor the temperature and be alerted whenever the actual temperature profile differs from the ideal by $> 0 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ . The derived variable was created to provide a steady target range during the run, no matter what the desired temperature range happened to be. Deviation from “ideal temperature profile” was chosen as the new variable to be monitored. The equipment already had access to the profile for the run, which described the desired temperature at a given time into the process. The manufacturer added a calculation each time the actual temperature was sampled, subtracting the ideal temperature from the actual. They provided as status variables\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.4  Example 4 –– Derived Variables (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.4  Example 4 –– Derived Variables\n\nContent: the actual temperature, the ideal temperature, and the new “deviation from profile” variable. One limit was activated and set to 0.5 degrees and a second set to $- 0 . 5$ degrees (each with a deadband width of 0.05). Thus, when the temperature deviation from setpoint exceeds $\\pm \\ : \\ : \\ : 0 . 5$ , an event is generated containing the current desired temperature and the actual temperature. For good measure, additional data was added, providing time since start of run to document the precise point in the process that the problem occurred. A7.2.4.2 In order to achieve the desired behavior, the host defines four monitoring limits. Two of the limits establish the target zone. These are responsible for reporting transitions from normal to warning zones in either direction. The other two limits establish the transitions between the warning zones and the error zones. The difference between UPPERDB and LOWERDB for each limit is 0.5. This may also be expressed as limit $\\pm \\ : \\ : 0 . 2 5\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.4  Example 4 –– Derived Variables (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A7.2.4  Example 4 –– Derived Variables\n\nContent: \\$ . Combining limits does not change the way the equipment treats limits monitoring, but rather builds a method of interpreting limits from the host’s point of view.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.1  Introduction (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.1  Introduction\n\nContent: A8.1.1 In many equipment control applications there is a need for a GEM host to modify one or a small set of process parameters associated with a recipe. The number of parameters modified, frequency of modification (e.g., wafer-to-wafer, batch-to-batch, etc.), range of modification, etc., is largely a function of the equipment control application. Utilizing GEM, at least two methods are envisioned for modifying process parameters on a tool. With the first method, “Equipment Constants” can be used to relate process parameters of the updated recipe. Equipment Constants can also be used in a mode where they relate suggested modifications to process parameters from the stored recipe, i.e., the constants contain only the $+ / -$ differential from a nominal value. The former mode is preferred because it better ensures data integrity between the controller and tool. With the second method the entire recipe could be downloaded, but this results in an enormous amount of communication overhead. Note that, in all\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.1  Introduction\n\nContent: cases, the Equipment Constants do not replace the process parameters inside a recipe, but are associated with (e.g., linked to) these parameters to relate modifications. The remainder of this application note provides a description of how process parameter modification can be implemented using existing GEM capabilities. The method may be used in a GEM compliant system provided that the specific GEM capabilities described are supported.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants\n\nContent: A8.2.1 Incremental process parameter modification for process and equipment control can be supported over a GEM interface by using the Equipment Constants GEM capability (see Section 4.5). With this capability, each process parameter (or process parameter at a step) that can be modified, e.g., for purposes of process control, is associated with an equipment constant. Using the Equipment Constant GEM scenarios (see Section 4.5.5) the host can (1), send process parameters or parameter modifications, (2), request current values of modifiable recipe parameters, (3), retrieve name lists of equipment constants associated with modifiable parameters, and (4), be informed by the equipment when an operator changes one of the modifiable process parameters. A8.2.2 The equipment constants should represent the actual values of the process parameters with which they are associated. Depending on the equipment operation and control application, the equipment constant could represent the actual value of a process\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants\n\nContent: parameter at a recipe step, or over the entire recipe. The equipment constants could also be utilized to represent the differentials of process parameters from nominal values. However it is important to note that, when using differential values to relate process parameter modifications, any loss of synchronization between equipment and host could result in an incorrect assessment of the value of a process setpoint by the host. Note also that, upon system startup, and whenever the appropriate process parameters are modified, the equipment constants should also be modified as necessary to always reflect the (absolute or relative) values of the associated process parameters. A8.2.3 In order to maintain synchronization between equipment and host, it is recommended that equipment constants associated with recipe parameters be applied to only override the currently selected and active recipe. A selected recipe is considered to be active whenever the equipment is in the “PROCESSING” state and the recipe\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants\n\nContent: is the currently selected recipe (process program). If multiple recipes are utilized during one process event, e.g., cluster tool scenario, it is recommended that separate equipment constants be utilized for each recipe/process parameter pair. A8.2.4 Note that timing and traceability issues associated with utilizing the equipment constants capability (for process control) are application specific and beyond the scope of this application note. Equipment that provides for recipe parameter overrides though setting of Equipment Contstants should also provide additional Equipment Constants for the set that includes the name of the associated process program and a Boolean variable to enable and disable the override feature. In addition, the supplier should document for each parameter: (1), the associated Equipment Constant, and (2), any restrictions on the state (active or not) or the recipe in which the parameter may be modified. Also, since override of the process setpoints may be provided by a Host\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.2  Equipment Constants\n\nContent: controller application element, it is recommended that the equipment provide an event report whenever the associated recipe has been modified.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.3  Example (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # A8.3  Example\n\nContent: A8.3.1 In the example of Figure A.8.1, a ChemicalMechanical Planarizer (CMP) single wafer “polishing” system includes a GEM compliant planarizer (equipment), a thickness metrology unit and a (host) controller. The tool polishes a wafer to a target thickness. The post-process thickness is measured by the metrology unit and reported to the host controller. The controller utilizes a feedback control algorithm to determine the appropriate polish “time” recipe parameter for the next wafer. This time should be reported to the CMP equipment utilizing the equipment’s GEM interface so that the information can be utilized for the next wafer processing event. A8.3.2 The mechanism described in this application note could be utilized to implement process control as follows.
