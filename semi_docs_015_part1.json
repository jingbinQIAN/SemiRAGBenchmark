Details are to be found in these standards. Devices are qualified at a level corresponding to the highest ESD stress they are able to withstand. R1-2.2 Simulation Test Results — In general all units must be data-logged both pre- and post-stress test. Any leakage current equal to or greater than a specific amount (company dependent—typically $1 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { A }$ or less) is “flagged” as a failure, and any current shift greater than about $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n A } }$ is marked on the record. R1-2.3 HBM Stress Testing A resistancecapacitance (R-C) network is used to simulate the ESD event. In an HBM ESD Simulator, a high voltage is used to charge the capacitor $( 1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p F } )$ which discharges through the resistor $( 1 5 0 0 \\Omega )$ into the device under\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-2  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-2  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing\n\nContent: test. The present standard test method requires a minimum of 2 discharges (i.e., 1 positive and 1 negative) per voltage level. R1-2.4 MM Stress Testing — An R-C network is also used in the MM ESD Simulator for ESD testing. High voltage charges the capacitor $( 2 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ \\textrm ~ { ~ p F ) ~ } }$ which discharges through the short wire $( \\sim 0 \\Omega )$ into the device under test. The present standard requires a minimum of 6 discharges (i.e., 3 positive and 3 negative). R1-2.5 CDM Stress Testing — The package and lead frame of the device are charged by direct charging or field induction. R1-2.5.1 For the Direct Charging Method, direct contact is made to one of the device leads connected to the substrate or bulk material of the device. The device is then discharged via a 1-ohm resistor to ground. R1-2.5.2 For the Field Induced Method, the device is placed on a metallic charging plate with the device packaging material touching the plate. Applying a voltage to\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-2  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-2  ESD Laboratory Simulation Testing\n\nContent: the charging plate raises the potential of the device. The induced voltage on the device is discharged to ground through a 1-ohm resistor that contacts each device lead. The present standard requires a minimum of 6 discharges (i.e., 3 positive and 3 negative) from each device lead.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-3  References\n\nR1-3.1  ESD Association Standards and Advisories\nANSI ESD STM5.2 Electrostatic Discharge\nSensitivity Testing – Machine Model\nANSI ESD STM5.3.1 — Charged Device Model\n(CDM) – Component Level\nESD ADV11.2 — Triboelectric Charge Accumulation\nTesting\nESD S6.1 — Grounding - Recommended Practices\nESD STM5.1 — Electrostatic Discharge Sensitivity\nTesting – Human Body Model\nESD TR11-01 Electrostatic Guidelines and\nConsiderations for Cleanrooms and Clean\nManufacturing\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-3.2  JEDEC Documents\n\nJESD22-A114 Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Sensitivity Testing Human Body Model (HBM) JESD22-C101 Field-Induced Charged-Device Model Test Methods for Electrostatic Discharge Withstand Thresholds of Microelectronic Components JESD625 — Requirements for Handling ElectrostaticDischarge-Sensitive (ESDS) Devices\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-3.3  Other Documents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R1-3.3  Other Documents\n\nContent: ANSI IEEE STD 142 — IEEE Recommended Practice for Grounding of Industrial and Commercial Power Systems ANSI/NFPA 70 — National Electrical Code MIL-STD 883 — Test Method Standard Microcircuits (Method 3015.7 – Electrostatic Discharge Sensitivity Classification), Defense Supply Center Columbus, P.O.

Many approaches to controlling static charge have been tried over the years and it is clear that there exists no single method for controlling all static charge problems. However, it has been shown that a consistently applied process for static charge control greatly reduces problems associated with static electricity. R2-1.2 One overriding issue should not be forgotten in the choice of static control materials and procedures. This is the need for compatibility with the cleanliness requirements of the area in which they are installed. A variety of static control materials are available, but some may not be cleanroom compatible due to issues of particle shedding, outgassing, or their chemical makeup. Each manufacturing area in the semiconductor factory should contain only those static control materials\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-1  Static Charge Control (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-1  Static Charge Control\n\nContent: that are appropriate to the cleanliness requirements of the area. Consult ESD TR11 for additional information.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.1  Triboelectric Charging (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.1  Triboelectric Charging\n\nContent: R2-2.1.1 A fundamental law of nature states that an electrostatic charge is generated whenever two dissimilar materials contact and then separate. The materials themselves, intimacy of contact, speed of separation and a variety of other factors determine the amount or level of electrostatic charge that is generated during any given contact and separation event. Predicting the level of charge ahead of time is nearly impossible. Due to this unpredictability, the best that can be done in a factory setting is to understand that electrostatic charge generation will always occur. However, electrostatic charge generation can be measured and charge mitigation is normally a possibility. Reducing charge generation requires modification of surfaces to increase lubricity (i.e., reduce friction), increase conductivity (i.e., allows charges to relax and flow back), and make the surfaces chemically similar. Normally, more than one of the above actions is required to provide a low\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.1  Triboelectric Charging (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.1  Triboelectric Charging\n\nContent: chargegenerating system. R2-2.1.2 While no intrinsic test method exists for the determination of triboelectric charge-generation properties, several practical evaluation techniques that apply to many factory situations may be found in ESD ADV 11.2.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.2  Effect of Humidity on Charge Generation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.2  Effect of Humidity on Charge Generation\n\nContent: R2-2.2.1 It is generally understood that at constant temperature and at increased relative humidity the normally observed manifestations of static charge generation, such as static cling and static shocks, are greatly reduced. This does not mean that static charge is not present in the environment. Even at $90 \\%$ RH, static charge may accumulate at a sufficient level to cause problems with some processes or cause damage to sensitive parts. Most factory processes, including cleanrooms, are run at a humidity level of $30 \\text{‰}$ . Within this range, most of the humidity-dependant lowcharging materials will function within their intended specifications. At lower humidity, surfaces dry out and may become a source of charge generation. R2-2.2.2 Specifying a humidity level for a factory is a reasonably good idea if kept realistic. However, maintaining a minimal level of humidity may be very expensive in some areas of the world during normally dry winter months. It\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.2  Effect of Humidity on Charge Generation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-2.2  Effect of Humidity on Charge Generation\n\nContent: could be more important and cost effective to choose materials that provide the required function for charge generation or dissipation at the lowest expected humidity. Many parts of the world experience humidity levels of $10 \\%$ or less during the winter months when outside air is brought inside and then heated to warm interior spaces. In these locations, which include the northern tier of US states and Canada, much of northern Asia, as well as northern Europe, careful attention to material selection is of major importance to assure adequate dissipative and low charge-generation performance.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials\n\nContent: R2-3.1 The primary method of controlling static charge is grounding. If there is a path for the charge to flow to earth ground, the static charge on facility surfaces, furniture, equipment, materials handled by the equipment, and any ESD-protective materials can be rapidly, and harmlessly, neutralized. Providing a path to ground brings everything to the same “zero” voltage electrical potential. All conductors in the environment, including personnel, should be electrically connected and attached to a known ground. It is important to note that insulators cannot lose their electrostatic charge by attachment to ground. Other charge-mitigating techniques (discussed in later sections) are required to neutralize excessive charge (i.e., electric field reduction) on the necessary insulators used in the electrostatic protective area (EPA), if their charge is considered a risk to sensitive parts handled in that location. R2-3.2 Grounding methods and their\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials\n\nContent: measurement are described in detail in ESD S6.1. Information on electrical power grounding, which is a separate issue not addressed in this document, may be found in ANSI/NFPA 70, ANSI/IEEE STD 142, or appropriate country guidelines. R2-3.3 Grounded conductors cannot maintain a static charge for very long. This is primarily dependent on the overall electrical resistance of the system. System resistance includes the resistance of the item being grounded, the contact resistance at the interface between items and the resistance in the actual grounding path. Since resistance of the system ground path determines the rate of discharge, it determines the amount of protection provided to ESD-sensitive devices. A permanent connection to ground will certainly prevent any charge from building up on an object and its subsequent transfer to an ESD-sensitive device. However, if an ungrounded, charged object contacts a material with too low a resistance to ground,\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials\n\nContent: a damaging discharge may occur. Even if no direct damage occurs, the ESD event creates EMI that may affect the operation of nearby production equipment. R2-3.4 It should be noted that attaching a large metallic object (e.g., a stainless steel work surface) to ground through a high resistance will not prevent a discharge from occurring to the large metallic object. The high capacitance of the metallic object, with respect to the ESD-sensitive device, can still result in ESD damage or EMI. R2-3.5 To prevent these conditions from occurring, the proper resistance for the ground path should be chosen. A class of materials has been developed, called static dissipative materials, which help to control discharge rates when materials are placed in contact. Static dissipative materials are created by lowering the resistivity of insulating materials through the addition of conductive particles, carbon particles, or chemical additives. When connected to ground,\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials\n\nContent: these materials slow the discharge rate from nanoseconds (typical for metal-to-metal contact) to as long as hundreds of milliseconds (depending on the size of the materials involved). While a discharge occurs to allow charge equalization with ground, a rapid, spark-producing discharge may not occur. R2-3.6 In modern production equipment, the frame and other machine elements are normally metallic and thus conductive. These machine elements are often covered with static dissipative materials. In these design situations, the conductive frame should be attached to ground without any added resistance to provide a ground plane. The dissipative surface over the conductive frame provides charge-draining characteristics suitable for reducing risk of damage from rapid discharges. R2-3.7 Static dissipative materials will need to retain their dissipative properties over the range of temperature and humidity conditions they will encounter, and not change\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials\n\nContent: significantly over time. In cleanrooms they should also meet requirements for avoiding micro-particle production and outgassing. R2-3.8 Measurements of the resistance and resistivity of static dissipative materials are used to characterize their effectiveness in a static control program. Measurements should be made of the materials themselves, as well as their performance in their installation location. There are several measurement methods available depending on the application. Acceptable resistance ranges may depend on the ESD sensitivity of the products or photomasks that are handled in the area. These will need to be determined by the end user and the material suppliers. R2-3.9 See the following test methods for resistance measurements of various items: ESD STM11.11: Surface Resistance Measurement of Static Dissipative Planar Materials ANSI ESD STM11.12: Volume Resistance Measurement of Static Dissipative Planar Materials Both test methods\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-3  Grounding Conductors and Static Dissipative Materials\n\nContent: characterize the resistivity or resistance of either static dissipative or conductive materials. These test methods can be used for construction materials, work surfaces, furniture components and most planar surfaces. They may also be used for packaging and transport materials. ANSI ESD S4.1 can be used to measure the resistance to a groundable point of these materials once they are in place. This can be done for work surfaces, construction materials (other than flooring), and other planar surfaces on furniture or equipment. ESD STM7.1 can be used to measure the resistance to a groundable point and resistance point-to-point for flooring, ANSI ESD STM12.1 can be used to measure the resistance to a groundable point for components of chairs. Resistance characteristics of the wrist straps used to ground personnel are covered in ANSI ESD S1.1. Cleanroom garments may be tested with the methods of ANSI ESD STM2.1.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-4  Static Charge Decay Time\n\nR2-4.1  In some cases, it will be important to know the actual time it takes to remove a known amount of charge from an object.  \nFED-STD-101 Method 4046 is often used for homogeneous materials.\nANSI ESD STM4.2 is used to measure decay time of worksurface materials.  \nR2-4.2  Please be aware that static decay time may not fully characterize an item or a material.  However, the information gathered in a decay time test may provide valuable insight into the electrostatic performance of an item or material when used in conjunction with other data such as resistance or resistivity.  Decay time is only useful for materials with a high resistance/resistivity.  For materials with resistance less than $1 0 ^ { 1 0 } ~ \\Omega$ , decay time does not apply because the equipment used is unable to measure decay times faster than 0.01 s.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel\n\nContent: R2-5.1 Since personnel are mobile electrical conductors, they pose a significant hazard in any ESDsusceptible workplace. Thus, grounding of personnel is among the most important of all static control technical requirements. All of the industry program management standards accepted around the world require grounding of personnel as a foremost requirement. The most important consideration for personnel in a properly designed electrostatic protective area (EPA) is to maintain the resistance to ground at $< 3 5 ~ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega$ for operations handling parts sensitive to above 100-V Human Body Model sensitivity. For areas handling parts susceptible to less than 100-V HBM, the resistance-to-ground specification should be reduced to less than $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega$ to ground. Testing by the ESD Association has shown that at $3 5 ~ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega$ to ground, a person can generate up to $1 0 0 { \\mathrm { V } }$ by vigorous movement such as sliding\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel\n\nContent: feet on the floor. At $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega$ to ground, the maximum voltage potential drops to about $6 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ , a level that is highly unlikely to contribute to damaging even the most sensitive parts (consider the resistance discussion above). Standard wrist strap test methods are described and defined in ANSI ESD S1.1. R2-5.2 For high-risk applications, advanced testing of personnel grounding systems may be required. A modern concept for continuous verification of personnel grounding includes wrist strap constant monitor systems. Choosing an appropriate system of constant monitoring requires an understanding of the actual performance measurement. To verify personnel grounding, it is important to measure the condition of the total system including the interaction of all the contact resistances, together with wrist strap bands and skin as well as ground cord, and shoes or shoe straps with skin or stocking moisture. Make sure all measurements\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel\n\nContent: include all the resistive interconnections of the grounding systems. Do not do system measurements without including all the components and personnel. R2-5.3 A common grounding appliance for personnel is a wrist strap and connecting ground cord attached to a common point grounding terminal at a workstation. Since this methodology is most suitable for seated personnel, it is a stated requirement in all of the recognized static control programs (i.e., ANSI ESD S20.20, JEDEC JESD625, IEC 61340-5-1, and EN 61340-5-1 (formerly CENNELEC 100015-1). R2-5.4 Another common methodology for grounding mobile personnel is a static control floor with static control footwear. If this concept is used as the primary grounding system, the resistance to ground has to be the same as for a wrist strap. A useful test method for resistance to ground of personnel through a floorfootwear system is ANSI ESD STM97.1. An alternative methodology in ANSI ESD S20.20 where the resistance to\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-5  Measuring Static Charge Levels on Personnel\n\nContent: ground of the floor-footwear system is above $3 5 ~ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega$ is to measure the voltage of a person relative to ground using ESD STM97.2. This method measures the charge generation characteristics of a person moving about on a floor. R2-5.5 Clothing coverings using approved static control materials are often a requirement, especially in cleanrooms. When ESD issues are involved, garments need to be tested using approved test methods. A useful method is ANSI ESD STM2.1. R2-5.6 Additional static control information, useful where personnel are concerned, may come from ESD TR03 for gloves and finger cots, ESD TR05 for garments, and ESD TR06 for triboelectrically charged garments.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-6  Neutralizing Charge on Insulators (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-6  Neutralizing Charge on Insulators\n\nContent: R2-6.1 Static charge on a conductive or staticdissipative object can be controlled if the object is provided with a path for the charge to flow to earth ground. Unfortunately, grounding methods do not provide complete protection from static-related problems. Even when earth grounding is an option, it is subject to human error. In applications where contamination is an issue, additives and carbon particles used in static-dissipative materials may become sources of contamination themselves. R2-6.2 While charge is mobile in a conductor (or in a static-dissipative material), in insulators charge is not mobile, and earth grounding is not an effective means of eliminating the static charge. More often than not, the product itself uses insulating materials, making earth grounding unavailable as an option. While silicon is a semiconductor, its oxide coating transforms it into an insulator. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is used in many chemical processes, and quartz in\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-6  Neutralizing Charge on Insulators (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-6  Neutralizing Charge on Insulators\n\nContent: hightemperature processes. Epoxy and ceramic packages are used for integrated circuits. Insulators are easily charged, retain their charge for long periods of time, and are often close to the product. R2-6.3 Dealing with static charge on insulators and isolated conductors will often require the use of some type of ionization or surface-resistance modification. Ionizers are the most effective means of dealing with static charges on insulators and isolated conductors if the surface cannot be modified by coating or treatment with some form of surface-dissipative or low-charging “antistatic” agent.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization\n\nContent: R2-7.1 For purposes of static charge control, ions are molecules of the gases in air (i.e., nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide) that have lost or gained an electron. Ions are present in normal outside air but are removed when air is subjected to filtration and air conditioning. Ionization systems work by increasing the conductivity of the air by supplying ionized gas molecules. Another way of looking at the application of ionization is to interpret the function as supplying opposite polarity charge from the air to surfaces charged to the opposite polarity. When ionized air comes in contact with a charged surface, the charged surface attracts ions of the opposite polarity. As a result, the static charge that has built up on products, equipment and surfaces is neutralized. R2-7.2 The most common methods of producing air ions are radioisotopes and “corona discharge” resulting from the electric field created when high voltage is applied to a sharp point. R2-7.3 The radioisotope most\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization\n\nContent: commonly used to produce ionization is polonium-210, an alpha particle emitter. The alpha particle collides with the surrounding gas molecules, dislodging electrons. Gas molecules that lose an electron become positive ions. The free electron is quickly captured by another neutral gas molecule, creating a negative air ion. Note that the process always creates pairs of positive and negative ions. R2-7.4 The corona discharge method produces a very high electric field that interacts with the electrons in the surrounding gas. The polarity of the ions depends on the polarity of the high voltage on the emitter point. Ionizers using the corona discharge method will often include some type of monitoring and feedback circuitry to assure that equal numbers of positive and negative ions are created. R2-7.5 Ions of opposite polarity to the charged surface are required. Either polarity of static charge may be created on facility and equipment surfaces, or on the product. Ionizers may be installed on the\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization\n\nContent: ceiling of the room or may be hung from the ceiling using appropriate mounting methods. Ionizers are installed in minienvironments, particularly in the product load and unload areas. Ionizers may also be installed in the interior of process equipment. No single ionizer type or installation location is sufficient to solve all the static problems in the semiconductor facility. R2-7.6 Ionizers should deliver ionization over a wide range of humidity and temperature conditions. Backend assembly and test areas often do not have the level of temperature and humidity control found in front-end wafer production. Ionizers installed in the cramped spaces of production equipment will be close to the product, in areas surrounded by grounded metal parts. Ionizers should isolate the emitter points from both the product and adjacent grounded surfaces. Ionizers should produce sufficient ions to discharge static on surfaces and on products moving at high speeds despite losses to ground. Most ionizers require\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-7  Ionization\n\nContent: maintenance and periodic verification of their performance. The appropriate ionizer installation will need to be engineered for each specific application.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.1  Types of Packaging (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.1  Types of Packaging\n\nContent: R2-8.1.1 Many forms of flexible and rigid packaging are used to protect ESD-susceptible items. Bags, boxes, wraps, tape and reel, pouches, cushioning foams, totes, tubes and numerous other forms of containers are available for any imaginable application. Each of these container forms is available in an ESD-protective version. Application in cleanroom environments adds additional requirements to the ESD-protective packaging properties. Some of these considerations may actually preclude the ability to provide ESD protection. Therefore, there may often be a tradeoff between ESD protection, cleanliness, and other required material properties. R2-8.1.2 The dissipative property for ESD protection requires some type of chemical, metallic or elemental additive to the bulk of the material or the surface of an ESD-protective item. Adding a highly conductive layer within the structure of the material or item provides the electrostatic-shielding property. Any additive or treatment may\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.1  Types of Packaging (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.1  Types of Packaging\n\nContent: contribute to contamination concerns for application in cleanrooms. R2-8.1.3 Making a material low charging (“antistatic”) requires modification of the surface to decrease surface resistance and reduce friction. Often, low charging materials allow a transfer of materials to contacting surfaces to make the actual surfaces similar in chemistry. Materials with chemically similar surfaces usually do not show high levels of charge generation when placed into contact and then separated from each other. A downside to this process is the potential contamination issue that may be involved if the materials are used in clean areas. Take care in selecting low-charging materials if cleanliness is a major issue. This concern includes ionic contamination, nonvolatile-residue and outgassing.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.2  Material Guidelines (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.2  Material Guidelines\n\nContent: R2-8.2.1 Physical Guidelines — The required material physical properties depend on the application involved. The selection process for a packaging material or system should consider all of the physical attributes generally associated with protecting an item during transit or storage. The physical requirements normally evaluated for any packaging system and associated test methods are shown in Table R2-1. Table R2-1 Packaging System Physical Properties R2-8.2.2 ESD-Protective Packaging Guidelines — The type of packaging required for ESD-susceptible items depends on where the item is going. Packaging materials used inside of an ESD-protected work area are static dissipative or low charging. When sensitive items are moved outside of the protected area, the level of protection should increase to include electrostatic discharge shielding. Some extremely sensitive items may require additional EMI or RFI protection provided by heavier layers of shielding. Materials that provide increased\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.2  Material Guidelines (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-8.2  Material Guidelines\n\nContent: shielding may also provide moisture barrier protection for enclosed items. The necessary electrical properties for packaging materials that are normally evaluated are shown with their associated test methods in Table R2-2. Table R2-2 ESD-Protective Packaging Properties R2-8.2.3 Contamination Control Guidelines Contamination issues are not limited to particles. Plastic processing additives to plastic packaging and handling materials, chemical and molecular compatibility should also be of concern. Users can evaluate plastic packaging and handling materials using published standard test methods. There are multiple test methods and procedures to identify contamination properties, as shown in Table R2-3. The user is advised to select the method best suited to their products that require protection. Table R2-3 Contamination Control Properties\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-9  Problem of Controlling Static Charge in Manufacturing Equipment\n\nR2-9.1  The interior of high-speed production equipment is a challenge to static control methods.  The high cost of production space requires equipment occupying the space to be compact and operate at as high a speed as practical.  Product moves through small spaces at high speed by a variety of robotic and other mechanisms. Triboelectric charging (i.e., charge generation due to friction or contact and separation of dissimilar materials) and contact with ground are almost unavoidable.  \nR2-9.2  Grounding of equipment parts that contact the product presents added difficulties when the equipment parts are moving at high speeds.  Dissipating charge from insulating surfaces and integrated circuit (IC) packages may be difficult if the charged surfaces are not accessible.  Using ionizers in these confined spaces presents challenges.  \nR2-9.3  Measuring the effectiveness of static control methods in equipment will take some ingenuity. Test methods are contained in SEMI E78 as well as ESD SP10.1.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects\n\nContent: R2-10.1 The fundamental problem in measuring accumulated charge on moving items in-situ is that only the static voltage or electrostatic field can be measured and not the actual charge. Direct measurements of static charge can be made with a coulombmeter or Faraday Cup (Pail), but only on stationary objects. Therefore, any measurements or alarm limits for moving objects can be set only in terms of accumulated static voltage or electric field. R2-10.2 Another difficulty in measuring the static voltage or electric field from accumulated charge on moving items in a manufacturing process is the response time of the instrumentation. Non-contact instruments measure the electric field emanating from the surface of a charged object and this takes a finite amount of time. While some instrument technologies are faster than others, the measurement tools selected for any application should consider the speed of the process. A similar situation occurs in\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects\n\nContent: selection of mitigation techniques, in particular ionizers, as speed of neutralization depends solely on the number of ions present in the immediate environment. R2-10.3 Electrostatic charge on an object (has to be a conductor to be accurate) is related to the electrical potential between the object and ground and the capacitance of the object relative to ground and the surroundings. There is a measurable relationship between an electric field measurement and the potential of the conductive object. For insulators, electrostatic charge cannot be determined by measuring electric fields. The electric field measurement on an insulator does not directly relate to electrostatic charge so therefore it cannot be used to determine the level of electrostatic hazard directly. A charged insulator can only discharge from a very small area upon contact. The electric field from a charged insulator causes damage only when it is of sufficient strength and the\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects\n\nContent: ESD-susceptible item is grounded while in the presence of that electric field. R2-10.4 ESD-instrument manufacturers are developing new instruments that have improved response time over earlier offerings. Much of this effort supports ESD SP10.1, which describes measurement of voltage and charge in Automated Handling Equipment. These instruments will enable static measurements, even in high-speed automated equipment. R2-10.5 Non-contact voltmeters are an important instrument type for measuring the electric field from charged objects. Reducing the response time for this class of instruments has been of major importance to allow meaningful measurement in moving systems. R2-10.6 Although the coulombmeter and Faraday Cup can only be used to measure static charge on stationary objects, they can still be useful in understanding the charge generation characteristics of parts traveling through process paths in component handling equipment. Direct charge\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-10  Measurement of Charge and Potential on Moving Objects\n\nContent: measurements combined with estimates of electrical potential from the electric field from a charged object can be used to determine appropriate ionization levels, surface treatment needs, grounding faults and provide insight into ESD risks associated with component movement.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-11  Standards and Process Control (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-11  Standards and Process Control\n\nContent: R2-11.1 Without any doubt, the most important aspect of electrostatic control today is the advance made in standardization and process control. Several industry standards that cover the development and implementation of an ESD Control Program were released in the years since 1999. The four most important standards are as follows: IEC 61340-5-1 — This document is a result of international cooperation at the International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Committee TC 101 Electrostatics. The companion User Guide IEC 61340-5-2 offers considerable guidance that may assist the new practitioner in ESD control. EN 61340-5-1 (formerly CENNELEC100015) — As a European Normative Standard (EN), this document has considerable influence among the European Common Market (ECM) countries and those that supply products to the ECM. The content of this document is identical to IEC 61340- 5-1. JEDEC JESD625 — A revision of EIA 625, this document provides a great deal of information\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-11  Standards and Process Control (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-11  Standards and Process Control\n\nContent: regarding ESD-program planning, implementation and auditing. The technical requirements are harmonized fairly well with the above referenced documents. ANSI ESD S20.20 — Technical requirements are similar to those stated in the above documents but the administrative requirements are quite different. ANSI ESD S20.20 was written to comply with ISO 9001-2000 type requirements for validation, verification and maintenance. Adopted by the US Department of Defense (DoD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and numerous corporations, ANSI ESD S20.20 is the only ESD-program standard that has an official certification program. ISO 9000 registrars have been trained and others are in training at this time to allow them to provide officially recognized audits leading to certification granted by the ISO registrar and the ESD Association. The ESD Association is the certifying body that recognizes trained registrar companies. At this\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-11  Standards and Process Control (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R2-11  Standards and Process Control\n\nContent: time, four registrar companies have trained personnel on staff that can support certification audits throughout most of Asia, North America and much of Europe. Numerous other registrars are being asked by their ISO/QS clients about ANSI ESD S20.20 certification so the list of certified registrars is expected to grow over time.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY -

There are many other sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the semiconductor-manufacturing environment that also cause similar effects. EMI is propagated via different means such as air, cables and even imperfectly installed grounding networks. R3-1.2 There are several regional and international standards regulating EMI susceptibility and parasitic emission of electronics products. Compliance of equipment with those standards is not a guarantee of complete immunity to EMI for several reasons, among which are: EMI conditions in semiconductor manufacturing environments often exceed the limits set forth by those standards. EMI performance of equipment can be substantially affected by installation, although EMC compliance testing does not take this into account.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-1  Background (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-1  Background\n\nContent: Interconnection of tools in the actual production environment creates a network of tools, which has its own EMI properties that are never tested during product design and approval cycle. There are neither guidelines nor regulations at the moment to guide EMI-conscious design of facilities or to properly maintain them in that regard. It would be beneficial to provide (at minimum) guidelines to cleanroom designers and maintenance personnel to assist them in implementing good EMI practices in their facilities.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-2  EMI GENERATION (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-2  EMI GENERATION\n\nContent: R3-2.1 Controlling EMI generation is a key component in EMI management. There are several types of generators of electromagnetic emission that can eventually cause EMI. Parasitic emission from equipment Intentional emission from equipment that uses electromagnetic fields as a part of the process R3-2.2 An ESD event is characterized by a very rapid transfer of electric charges. As a result, a very fast transient electromagnetic field is generated. The effect on the equipment is determined not only by the voltage that was discharged by the ESD event, but also by the charge that was dissipated during the event and the properties of contact. Another important parameter in assessing EMI impact of ESD events is the propagating properties of the discharging parts. More effective antennas lead to a higher magnitude of electromagnetic field. R3-2.3 Parasitic emissions from equipment are a side product of normal operation of equipment. Though FCC, CE or similar regulations tightly control\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-2  EMI GENERATION (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-2  EMI GENERATION\n\nContent: parasitic emission, in actual installations these emissions are often higher than expected. This is often attributed to high tool densities, extra long cabling, partially engaged connectors, and often-open covers that are supposed to attenuate electromagnetic emission from these cables. R3-2.4 Intentional radiation generated by some types of tools causes substantial EMI as a part of normal operation. Examples include CVD tools and ion implanters.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-2.5  EMI Propagation\n\nR3-2.5.1  Controlling the propagation path is another key component in EMI management.  Electromagnetic field propagation paths include:  \nRadiated – via air Conducted – via cables and wires Combined – an example of such is EMI picked up from the air by a cable or a wire and carried into equipment as a conducted emission.  \nR3-2.5.2  Poor grounding and power distribution networks provide paths for EMI to propagate from one tool to another.  It is not uncommon to witness EMI from one corner of a cleanroom to manifest itself in another, distant corner.  \nESD events (discharges)  \nR3-2.6  The following categories of EMI are recommended for consideration in setting limits:  \nContinuous radiated emission\nContinuous conducted emission\nTransient radiated emission\nTransient conducted emission\nEMI levels on the ground and on the power lines  \nIt is anticipated that FCC and CE regulations would be considered as one of the factors in setting the limits, but surveys of the actual environment in the factory will also need to be considered.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-3  EMI Effect on Equipment\n\nR3-3.1  There are three main ways EMI can affect equipment:  \nR3-3.1.1  Destruction — The signals created by EMI in the circuit exceed the breakdown threshold of components, which leads to their destruction.  This is especially relevant to conducted EMI.  \nR3-3.1.2  Malfunction — EMI injects pseudo-legitimate signals into the circuit, which leads to that circuit’s malfunction.  Such malfunction may range from complete lockup to unwanted operation of the tool. This is frequently misdiagnosed as software errors. Often, this type of malfunction involves several tools connected together.  \nVery short duration – from a few nanoseconds to several hundred nanoseconds,\nVery broad frequency range (up to several GHz), and\nOften high magnitude.  \nThere are several types of equipment available to detect and measure electromagnetic fields from ESD events.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4.5  AM Radio\n\nR3-4.5.1  Since electromagnetic fields from ESD events are manifested as short bursts of energy, they may be detected by a conventional AM radio tuned to a frequency free of radio stations.  The radio produces “clicks” when it detects ESD events.  The AM radio has difficulties picking up weak and very rapid discharges, and in industrial environments it is likely to pick up noise from normal equipment operation.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4.6  EMI Locators\n\nR3-4.6.1  Several types of EMI Locators are available, including portable handheld types and larger instruments.  The simplest type provides both a visual and audible indication of the transient EMI from an ESD event.  Although it can discriminate between two sensitivity levels for EMI, it gives no information regarding the magnitude of the ESD event that produced the EMI.  Their frequency response is also limited to approximately $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { M H z }$ and they may miss the faster EMI signals.  \nR3-3.1.3  False Sensor Readings — Signals induced by EMI add to the signals coming from sensors and leads equipment to misread sensor data.\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4  EMI Measurements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4  EMI Measurements\n\nContent: R3-4.1 Measuring EMI can be a very effective tool in ESD management in the cleanroom, as EMI is a signature that ESD events are occurring. The following are some of the parameters and test methods that are recommended to be checked during such audits. R3-4.6.2 A second type of EMI Locator is a generalpurpose electromagnetic field strength meter with a bandwidth (up to $2 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ ) to measure EMI from ESD events. It has a directional antenna to help identify sources of emission, and provides outputs for emission levels and the counting of ESD events, including time stamping. This can be very useful in correlating ESD events with equipment malfunctions. Some units will also provide discrimination of multiple ESD events and provide output signals directly to a computer or factory management system. R3-4.2 Radiated EMI Levels Near Equipment — Both continuous and transient (peak) should be measured and identified. R3-4.3 Conducted EMI on Cables — Both continuous and transient\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4  EMI Measurements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4  EMI Measurements\n\nContent: (peak). Due to practical considerations, an acceptable method will have to be devised to measure conducted EMI on hard-to-reach cables. R3-4.4 Electromagnetic emissions generated by ESD events have unique properties. These include: Very short rise time – as short as hundreds of picoseconds,\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4.7  High-Speed Storage Oscilloscopes (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4.7  High-Speed Storage Oscilloscopes\n\nContent: R3-4.7.1 An oscilloscope equipped with proper antennae provides the most comprehensive information about waveform and magnitude of EMI caused by ESD events. The minimum requirements for an oscilloscope used for this purpose are a 500-MHz bandwidth and a 5-gigasamples/s sampling rate. Instruments with lesser performance specifications would either miss or misinterpret EMI parameters. R3-4.7.2 The use of a high-speed oscilloscope should be accompanied by the use of a proper antenna for receiving the electromagnetic fields. For time domain measurements it is important to use an antenna with a flat frequency response since frequency correction that is common in the frequency domain is not possible for time domain measurements. Another important note is that a typical oscilloscope captures only one event (i.e., first or last one, depending on trigger setting), missing multiple events that are common. R3-4.7.3 Spectrum analyzers common in EMC test and wireless communication\n\nSEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4.7  High-Speed Storage Oscilloscopes (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E129-1103 GUIDE TO ASSESS AND CONTROL ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY - # R3-4.7  High-Speed Storage Oscilloscopes\n\nContent: are not practical for detecting EMI from ESD events due to their unacceptably low acquisition speed.

High impedance to ground at high frequencies prevents EMI from being dissipated.  Long ground wires act as receiving antennae that inject high-frequency signals into tools.

(As defined in SEMI E57.) 5.2.2 BOLTS plane — a plane parallel to the facial datum plane near the front of the tool where the box/opener loader is attached. (As defined in SEMI E63.) 5.2.3 facial datum plane — a vertical plane that bisects the wafers and that is parallel to the front side of the carrier (where wafers are removed or inserted). On tool load ports, it is also parallel to the load face plane specified in SEMI E15 on the side of the tool where the carrier is loaded and unloaded. (As defined in SEMI E57.) 5.2.4 horizontal datum plane — a horizontal plane from which projects the kinematic-coupling pins on which the carrier sits.

(As defined in SEMI E127.) 5.2.6 measurement module — an equipment module whose intended function is to measure or inspect the product and to report the results. Measurement of the product is the factory’s means of gaining feedback on the manufacturing process.

This includes meeting the requirements for the hole opening, bolt hole pattern, and other relevant requirements. Note that certain requirements in SEMI E63, such as y76 (facial datum plane when carrier is undocked), do not have relevance for the IMM but will not be in conflict. 6.2 Use of Datum Planes — The location in space where a substrate is delivered to an IMM is the intersection of three orthogonal datum planes defined in other standards: the facial datum plane, the nominal wafer-seating plane and the bilateral datum plane. The BOLTS plane, as in SEMI E63, is defined to be parallel to, and at a distance of $\\mathtt { y 7 0 }$ from the facial datum plane. 6.2.1 Bilateral Datum Plane All bilateral dimensions of the interface are symmetric about the bilateral datum plane as shown in Figure 1. 6.2.2 Facial Datum Plane — This is the vertical plane, parallel to the BOLTS plane, which bisects the\n\nSEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements\n\nContent: substrate at the insertion and removal position of the substrate inside of the IMM. The distance from the BOLTS plane to the facial datum plane in the IMM is determined by y70 of SEMI E63. 6.2.3 Nominal Wafer-Seating Plane — The nominal wafer-seating plane is the horizontal plane within the IMM where a substrate is to be loaded to or unloaded from by the tool. It can be anywhere between the given minimum and maximum values that follow. This range is not defined by a single standard, rather it results from a combination of dimensions of SEMI E1.9, SEMI E15.1 and SEMI E47.1. (See Figure 1.) 6.2.3.1 The minimum value for a nominal waferseating plane is the sum of $\\mathrm { { ( H + \\ z 4 4 + \\ z 8 ) } }$ ), measured from the floor. 6.2.3.2 The maximum value for a nominal waferseating plane is calculated by $\\mathrm { ( H + \\ z 4 4 + \\ z 8 + \\ ( 2 5 - l ) \\ ^ { \\ * } }$ z12), measured from the floor. 6.2.3.3 For both calculations, $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ is from SEMI E15.1,\n\nSEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements\n\nContent: z44 is from SEMI E47.1, and $^ { z 8 }$ and z12 are from SEMI E1.9. 6.3 Internal Clearances — There are requirements relating to clearances inside the IMM. These relate to robot arm requirements for substrate handoff, and can be referenced from SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1 as the same restrictions apply. 6.3.1 This includes clearance in front of the wafer setdown location of radius $r 3$ , and heights bounded by z11 and $z 1 0$ relative to the nominal wafer-seating plane. All clearance requirements above the highest and below the lowest slot from SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1 must be followed depending on the nominal wafer-seating plane selected. 6.4 Maximum Outer Dimensions — If the IMM is intended to be located at the front side of a tool (where load ports are usually located), the outer dimensions of the IMM shall not exceed the volume as it would be used, when a load port is attached to a BOLTS-M interface. 6.4.1 Depth — The depth of the IMM located at the front of the\n\nSEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements\n\nContent: process tool shall not exceed the maximum depth of a load port. The entire depth of the IMM shall not exceed the sum of $y 7 0 + { \\bf y } 7 6 + { \\bf \\delta D }$ (from SEMI E63 and SEMI E15.1 respectively), as measured from the BOLTS plane. 6.4.1.1 The IMM shall not extend toward the tool beyond the BOLTS plane, except for possible temporary use of the reserved space defined in SEMI E63. 6.4.2 Width — If locating the IMM adjacent to another load port, there are width requirements defined by the carrier centroid spacing dimension S from SEMI E15.1. 6.4.2.1 If locating the IMM adjacent to an occupied load port containing a FOUP with handles, then the design of the width should not compromise the C1 clearance dimension from SEMI E15.1. NOTE 3: Most tools today are designed with the dimension S chosen for spacing of boxes with handles. If the IMM width exceeds twice the x50 dimension for a FOUP with handles (from SEMI E47.1) then the IMM may not comply with the C1\n\nSEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 6  Requirements\n\nContent: requirement for integration with most existing tools. 6.4.3 Height — A height H2 (from SEMI E15.1) is the upper maximum boundary for the IMM when located at the front of the tool. 6.4.4 Exclusion Volume — There is an exclusion volume, defined by dimensions $\\mathrm { L _ { d } }$ and $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { h } }$ at the bottom rear of the IMM reserved for requirements from SEMI E64. The width of this exclusion volume is the full width of the tool. 6.4.5 The front of the IMM (towards the tool) between the floor and up to the height of a load port, as given by the sum of H (SEMI E15.1) plus z79 (SEMI E63), is identical with the BOLTS plane. Above this height, the front of the IMM is limited by the equipment boundary as defined in SEMI E15.1. NOTE 4: The BOLTS plane and the equipment boundary are defined by a different set of dimensions and thus are at different positions. The BOLTS plane is located more towards the tool.\n\nSEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # 7.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E6 — Guide for Semiconductor Equipment Installation Documentation\nSEMI E51 — Guide for Typical Facilities Services and Termination Matrix\nSEMI E62 — Specification for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ Front-Opening Interface Mechanical Standard (FIMS)\nSEMI E101 — Provisional Guide for EFEM Functional Structure Model\nSEMI E106 — Provisional Overview Guide to SEMI Standards for Physical Interfaces and Carriers for 300 mm Wafers\n\nSEMI E131-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INTERFACE OF AN INTEGRATED MEASUREMENT MODULE (IMM) INTO 300 mm TOOLS USING BOLTS-M - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 CALCULATION OF NOMINAL WAFER-SEATING PLANE\n\nNOTICE:  This related information is not an official part of SEMI E131 and was derived from work by the originating task force.

SEMI E15.1 defines the horizontal datum plane H to identify a reference plane for positioning kinematic couplings. While there are no kinematic couplings required for the IMM, we use this same dimension as a starting point for defining the nominal wafer-seating plane for wafer insertion and removal. As in SEMI E15.1, the horizontal datum plane is given at a height H relative to the floor. R1-1.2 Next, from SEMI E47.1 there is defined an external horizontal datum plane (equal to the horizontal datum plane from SEMI E15.1) and an internal horizontal datum plane, where the internal horizontal datum plane is located at a height of z44 above the external horizontal datum plane.

While this method provides for more efficient cooling, the proximity of the coolant to the resistive film can potentially result in damage to the resistive film caused by electrolysis generated by the DC energy passing through the fluid in the termination. 7.4.3.1 For this reason, if an RF termination using both internal and external cooling is used, it is important to periodically check the resistor for damage due to electrolysis.

The technique employed for this test is to first calibrate the calorimetric power meter with DC energy, which can be very precisely determined. Then, use two digital multimeters (e.g., Fluke™ 87 or equivalent) to determine the actual DC power applied to the calorimeter. Finally, once the DC calibration has been performed at a particular power level, connect the output of the RF generator under test to the calorimeter and measure the output power of the RF generator. The basic steps involved in the use of this system are outlined below. 9.2 Calibrate the Calorimeter Calibrate the calorimeter with the stable DC power supply, using the two digital multimeters to read the\n\nSEMI E136-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 9  Test Procedure for Determining RF Generator Output Power (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E136-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 9  Test Procedure for Determining RF Generator Output Power\n\nContent: voltage and current applied to the calorimeter’s RF load. 9.3 Connections — Connect the DC power supply, the digital multimeters, and the RF load according to Figures 1 and 2. Make the connections between the multimeters, the DC power supply, and the RF load using high-quality low-loss cable and high-quality corrosion-free cable terminations. 9.3.1 Use a calorimeter equipped with a coolant system. NOTE 5: Most calorimeter systems use either a tap-water coolant system or a recirculating system of some type. Best results may be obtained through the use of a self-contained heat exchanger and coolant recirculating system. 9.3.2 Make all of the electrical and coolant connections to the calorimeter. 9.3.3 Apply main power to the calorimeter system and allow one hour for stabilization. 9.3.4 Load Differential Temperature Most calorimeter systems will yield optimum performance when certain operating parameters\n\nSEMI E136-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 9  Test Procedure for Determining RF Generator Output Power (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E136-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 9  Test Procedure for Determining RF Generator Output Power\n\nContent: relating to the differential temperature across the RF load and the flow rate are maintained. In most cases, a differential temperature of $2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ represents a good beginning point. The coolant flow rate may then be set to provide for this differential temperature. 9.3.4.1 The following formula may be used to arrive at the correct coolant flow rate. $$ P o w e r = 6 9 . 3 2 \\times \\varDelta T \\times F l o w R a t e $$ where: Power is in $\\mathrm { w }$ , $\\varDelta T$ is in $^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , and Flow Rate is in $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { L } / \\operatorname* { m i n }$ . 9.3.4.2 Solving for flow rate yields: $$ F l o w R a t e = ( P o w e r / 6 9 . 3 2 ) / A T $$ 9.3.5 Coolant Types — In most cases, the coolant used in calorimetric power measurement systems is pure distilled water.

Consult the calorimeter operating manual for specific details. 9.3.6 Calorimeter Calibration Following the calorimeter warm-up, the device is ready for calibration. 9.3.6.1 With the calorimeter operating at the appropriate flow rate, apply DC power to the RF load, according to the voltage and current readings obtained with the two digital multimeters. 9.3.6.2 Multiply the voltage reading by the current reading to obtain the power applied to the load. 9.3.6.3 Allow 15 minutes for the calorimeter reading to stabilize. 9.3.6.4 Using the procedure in the calorimeter operating manual, set the calorimeter\n\nSEMI E136-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 9  Test Procedure for Determining RF Generator Output Power (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E136-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OUTPUT POWER OF RF GENERATORS USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 9  Test Procedure for Determining RF Generator Output Power\n\nContent: such that the calorimeter reading is exactly the same as that obtained using the voltage and current meters. 9.3.6.5 At this point, add any offsets that are associated with interconnecting cable losses, as outlined in Sections 6.5.2 and 6.5.3. 9.3.6.6 The calorimeter is now calibrated at this specific power level. NOTE 6: If a new power level is selected, repeat this process in order to compensate for instrumentation linearity effects of the calorimeter. 9.3.7 RF Generator Testing — With the calorimeter calibrated at a particular power level, it is now possible to test the RF generator power output at this level. 9.3.8 Connections — Connect the RF generator output to the RF load according to Figure 3.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 10, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2005; to be published March 2005.\n\nSEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The purpose of this guide is to provide standard cost of ownership (COO) metrics for evaluating unit production cost effectiveness of gas delivery systems in the semiconductor industry.  \n1.2  This guide also illustrates how to apply the COO metrics to gas delivery systems.  Users should be able to calculate the COO for any piece of gas delivery equipment using this guide.  \nNOTE 1:  A spreadsheet (Microsof $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ Excel) has been provided as an illustrative example.  \n1.3  The guide establishes a well-defined procedure to facilitate an understanding of equipment-related costs by providing definitions, classifications, algorithms, methods, and default values necessary to build a full or constrained COO calculator.\n\nSEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This guide defines a COO metric that can be applied to any gas delivery system.  Some terms are specialized to integrated circuit wafer and device production, but may be adapted for other applications.  \nNOTICE: This guide does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this guideline to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  Effective building of a COO model requires identification of constraints and data values.  Example data is provided in this document and may be updated periodically.  Where possible, use direct values for inputs rather than deriving them from secondary models or using example values.  \n3.2  Certain factors are more difficult than others to accurately determine.  Figure 1 depicts the relationship of some of the COO factors to ability to collect and validate information.  The accuracy of a COO calculation may be prone to a variety of errors or omissions.  \n3.3  A COO calculation may have more detail than presented explicitly in this guide.  The structure of the guide, however, allows for these situations.\n\nSEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 4  Referenced Standards\n\n4.1  SEMI Standards  \nSEMI E10 — Specification for Definition and Measurement of Equipment Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM)  \nSEMI E35 — Guide to Calculate Cost Of Ownership (COO) Metrics for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 5  Terminology (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: 5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms 5.1.1 COO — Cost of ownership 5.1.2 CYL — Cost of yield loss 5.1.3 DLY — Defect limited yield 5.1.4 ER — Equipment required (integer number) 5.1.5 EY — Equipment yield 5.1.6 PLY — Parametric limited yield 5.1.7 PRY— Product yield 5.1.8 PU — Production utilization (total) 5.1.9 TP — Throughput 5.2 Definitions 5.2.1 baseline cost of ownership — a constrained version of cost of ownership (COO) that only includes equipment yield [i.e., defect limited yield and parametric limited yield are not included]. 5.2.2 comprehensive cost of ownership — cost of ownership (COO) calculated with no constraints. 5.2.3 constrained cost of ownership — cost of ownership (COO) version with a set of defined restrictions to facilitate comparisons or to remove ambiguity. 5.2.4 consumable — part of the piece of equipment that is worn out by the process operation of the piece of equipment and requires replacement after less than one year of operation. 5.2.5 cost footprint — the area (A) of the smallest\n\nSEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 5  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E140-0305 GUIDE TO CALCULATE COST OF OWNERSHIP (COO) METRICS FOR GAS DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: horizontal rectangle that contains all of the shadow footprint and half of the easement space around the piece of equipment.

This edition was approved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on May 20, 2005.  It was available at www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005.\n\nSEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 The application of integrated metrology is anticipated to become a key factor for advanced process control in future integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. Important parameters, which are typically measured for the characterization and qualification of device manufacturing steps, are the thickness and the optical properties of fabricated layers and the critical dimensions (CD) of submicron structures. For the measurement principle of ellipsometry, which is commonly applied in both applications, different equipment and, hence, procedures and notations for data acquisition and modeling exist. If, therefore, ellipsometry is to be applied for integrated metrology equipment, the physical and the software integration into the equipment should be standardized to avoid efforts for specific installations depending on the equipment and fabrication environment. 1.2 The description of the mechanical integration of an ellipsometer into an equipment module (e.g. a front end module or an equipment chamber) comprises\n\nSEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: the specification of the ellipsometer equipment and the spatial arrangement of the ellipsometer modules and components, • specification of the relative position of the ellipsometer equipment to the equipment module, and • specification of the mechanical interfaces to the equipment module. 1.3 A prerequisite for a standardized software integration of an ellipsometer is the standardized notation of the layer counting method, the measurement parameters, the measurement data, and the measurement results. This document describes the position of the metrology equipment with respect to the sample. The position of the measurement position (i.e. the position of the measurement spot) refers to the description of the wafer surface coordinate system as described in SEMI M20. 1.4 The purpose of this standard is to provide a guide for a unique specification of the most commonly applied ellipsometer equipment, the comprised modules and components, and their spatial arrangement. In this standard, the notation for parameters\n\nSEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY - # 1  Purpose (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E141-0705GUIDE FOR SPECIFICATION OF ELLIPSOMETER EQUIPMENT FORUSE IN INTEGRATED METROLOGY - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: required in data acquisition and modeling is specified, and a unique notation for remote access on measurement parameters, data, and results is provided. Derived from these definitions, the required parameters to identify the calibration status of an ellipsometer are specified. Additionally, recommendations for preferred physical units are given. 1.5 The standard is intended for use in integrated metrology, but may also be applicable for stand-alone metrology.",
