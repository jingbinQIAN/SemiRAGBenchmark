This specification defines the interlock timeouts to be monitored by the active equipment and the passive equipment. Table 7 shows the interlock timeouts for active equipment. Table 8 shows the timeouts for the passive equipment. TAx (x is a number) represents the timer for the active equipment, and $\\mathrm { T P x }$ (x is a number) represents the timer for the passive equipment. The range for all timers (except TD0) shall be from 1 second to 999 seconds. All timer setpoints shall be user programmable. 6.3.2.2 The delay timer specifies the delay time between VALID signals within one continuous sequence of handoffs. Specifically, it signifies the delay following the VALID signal turning OFF on the completion of the first handoff and the VALID signal turning ON at the start of the second handoff. The delay timer is required because the passive equipment may need a certain time margin to detect the\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # 6.3.2  Error Detection (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # 6.3.2  Error Detection\n\nContent: second VALID signal transition to ON. Table 9 shows the delay timer. All timer setpoints shall be user programmable. 6.3.2.3 The recommended and optional delay timer TD0 defines the timing between CS_0 or CS_1 ON and VALID ON for the active equipment as shown in the signal time diagrams. In this way, the passive equipment can predict the timing in which the active equipment will output the signal allowing the transfer interlock to be performed accurately. Table 7 Active Equipment Timer #1 The minimum timer value does not define the response time of the active equipment. #2 These timer values must be implemented for detecting timeouts and are not meant to specify the delay time between signals. The equipment response time must be faster than the timeout of the timer.

Recovery procedures may require operator assistance and/or proprietary procedures specific to the equipment. It is recommended that the recovery procedure (ex, abort interlock sequence and set to restart/complete) be provided on the active equipment and the passive equipment.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # 6.4  Connector Type, Signal, and Pin Assignment (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # 6.4  Connector Type, Signal, and Pin Assignment\n\nContent: 6.4.1 The connector type for the passive equipment side must be type DB-25 socket housing (female) as specified in ISO 2110:1989. The connector will have female 4-40 threaded jack screw locks. Suitable 25 pin connectors known as Type “D” are similar to Amphenol MIN RAC 17 series with jack screw locks. It is recommended that the connector on the passive equipment should be appropriately labeled. As shown in Figure 30, this standard specifies the connector on the passive side optical PI/O for floor based vehicles (RGV, AGV, others) (case 1), as well as the active to passive connector between an overhead delivery system and production equipment (case 2). Figure 31 defines the PI/O point of interface for the interbay AMHS (OHS and stocker). If the OHS is the active device in the interbay AMHS then the stocker is the passive device. Likewise, if the OHS is the passive device, then the stocker is the active device. : Photo Coupled $\\blacktriangle$ 6.4.2 Power and signal specifications are as\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # 6.4  Connector Type, Signal, and Pin Assignment (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # 6.4  Connector Type, Signal, and Pin Assignment\n\nContent: follows: Table 10 Input/Output Specifications 6.4.2.1 Power Supply Voltage: $+ 2 4$ Vdc Nominal (Min. $+ 1 8$ Vdc, Max. $+ 3 0 { \\mathrm { ~ V d c } } )$ ) from no load to full load $\\mathrm { \\Omega _ { 1 0 0 m A } ) }$ . 6.4.2.2 For hardwired applications the power and power common of the passive must be isolated from the power and power common of the active.

The recommendations in this appendix are optional and are not required to conform to this standard. Determination of the suitability of the material is solely the responsibility of the user.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes\n\nContent: A1-1.1 If the connection to the equipment for overhead delivery is made using an electrical connector, Figure A1-1 defines a zone on the process or metrology equipment where the plug can be located. This zone is independent of the exclusion zones for parallel I/O devices defined by SEMI E15.1. The zones defined in SEMI E15.1 are designed to be used primarily for photo-coupled floor based delivery systems such as AGVs or RGVs, while the zone defined here on the top of the passive equipment applies primarily to a plug for overhead communication. The plug should be on the top or top edge of the equipment as shown and could be on either side of the bay/chase wall, depending on the location of the wall. In some implementations, the wall may not exist. A1-1.2 During the first few sequences of the SEMI E84 protocol before the carrier transfer begins if an error occurs the active vehicle should send an error to the host which leads to an automatic recover without human intervention. The active vehicle, on its\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes\n\nContent: own or in response to a host-initiated signal, should automatically recover any SEMI E84 error up to the BUSY ON state. A1-1.3 No application of parallel I/O communication can provide perfect isolation due to Electro-magnetic radiation into and between parallel conductors. Precautions should be taken, by all equipment suppliers, including but not limited to insuring a minimum capacitance of signal lines to reduce susceptibility to noise introduced into the equipment. A1-1.4 There are two types of equipment, internal buffer equipment and fixed buffer equipment. Internal buffer equipment is equipment that uses locations other than load ports within the equipment to store carriers. Fixed buffer equipment is production equipment that has only fixed load ports and no internal buffer for carrier storage. Wafers are loaded and unloaded directly from the carrier at the load port for processing. A1-1.5 This standard specifies two different PI/O configurations, one PI/O per load port and one PI/O per two load\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes\n\nContent: ports (Figure A1-2). Carrier transfer throughput and efficiency is higher if more than one carrier is transferred at the same time. Carrier transfer time is also reduced if the intrabay AMHS equipment can deliver two or more carriers at the same time from one parked position. Typically internal buffer equipment that allows hand-off of two carriers to two load ports either simultaneously or continuously can best take advantage of these throughput improvements. Thus, internal buffer equipment will require either one PI/O per load port (Figure A1-3, Concept A) or one PI/O per two load ports (Figure A1-3, Concept B), depending on the AMHS delivery system. Fixed buffer equipment will require one PI/O device per load port (Figure A1-4). Based on their production equipment and AMHS systems, end users will specify the SEMI E84 concept (one PI/O per load port or one PI/O per two load ports) and location that will be required on the manufacturing equipment. A1-1.6 Figure 17 does not define a particular\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes\n\nContent: orientation of the PI/O interface sensor unit. Figure A1-5 shows how to orient the PI/O device for AGV/RGV of the exclusion volume in the load port. Refer to SEMI E15.1 for descriptions of D7, D8, H7, H8, and W8.

NOTE 2: Continuous hand-off for different load port: use each PI/O sequentially. Figure A1-3 Optional PI/O Configuration for Internal Buffer Equipment Figure A1-4 Typical PI/O Configuration for Fixed Buffer Equipment A1-1.7 This standard specifies a signal “on” state as $1 . 8 { \\mathrm { V d c } }$ or less. Typical TTL circuits typically require a pulldown to $0 . 8 ~ { \\mathrm { V d c } }$ or less. For hard-wired connections, some TTL input circuits might not be able to sense an “on” state between $0 . 8 { \\mathrm { V d c } }$ and $1 . 8 { \\mathrm { V d c } }$ . One possible implementation is to provide an input receiver\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-1  General Applications Notes\n\nContent: circuit. Figure A1-5 Example of the PI/O Interface Sensor Unit Implementation at Load Port for AGV/RGV A1-1.8 Equipment Integration Test Mode — It is recommended that the passive equipment provide a method to disable any physical carrier engagement/movement after the SEMI E84 sequence (example carrier clamping on the load port and docking to the FIMS port) on a load port by load port basis. This functionality will support equipment level testing of automated carrier transfers and SEMI E84 communications at load ports.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-2  Reticle Loadport Connector Locations\n\nA1-2.1  For equipment with reticle carrier loadports, if the connection for automated delivery to the equipment is made using an electrical connector, the connector should be located on the top of the equipment outside of the easement for overhead transport.  The connector should be no more than $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ from the edge of the easement.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3  Additional Interbay AMHS Information\n\nA1-3.1  This section describes error generation and recovery examples (mainly for active equipment) for interbay AMHS (i.e., OHS, stockers).  The following are errors that could conceivably occur during transfer operations (load, unload).  The procedures are designed for a technician with considerable knowledge of AMHS equipment.  Error recovery should always follow the recovery procedures specified in the equipment manuals.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.2.1.1  OHS Side Error Generation\n\nA1-3.2.1.1.1  OHS Side Signals — When an error is generated, the BUSY signal must stay ON.  This is to prevent secondary accidents due to the other device operating on its own.  \nA1-3.2.1.1.2  Stocker Side Signals — When an error is generated, each signal (except for the READY signal) should remain in the status it was in at the time of the error.  The READY signal should go OFF.  \nA1-3.2.1.2  Stocker Side Error Generation  \nA1-3.2.1.2.1  Stocker Side Signals — When an error is generated, each signal should remain in the status it was in at the time of the error.  \nThe READY signal should be OFF.\nThe ES signal should be OFF.\nHO_AVBL should be OFF.  \nA1-3.2.1.3  OHS Side Signals — When an error is generated, only the BUSY signal should go ON.  All remaining signals should go OFF.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.2.2  Recovery Sequences\n\nA1-3.2.2.1  Should an error occur during transfer operations (refer to Tables 1 and 2), the recovery should begin by returning the carrier to the stocker or OHS.  Then, the error should be recovered.  The four recovery scenarios are:  \n1. Load operation, carrier is returned to the stocker.\n2. Load operation, carrier is returned to the OHS.\n3. Unload operation, carrier is returned to the stocker.\n4. Unload operation, carrier is returned to the OHS.  \nA1-3.2.3  Recovery Method  \nA1-3.2.3.1  OHS Side  \n• In the case of sequence 2 (above), the load/unload sequence should be started over from the beginning.\n• In the case of sequence 3 (above), the corresponding transfer operation should be canceled.\n• In the case of sequences 1 and 4 (above) the corresponding transfer operation should be considered completed.  \nA1-3.2.3.2  Stocker Side  \n• In the case of sequences 1 and 4 (above) the corresponding transfer operation should be considered completed.\n• In the case of sequences 2 and 3 (above), the load/unload sequence should be started over from the beginning.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.3  Stocker (Active Type) Error Examples (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.3  Stocker (Active Type) Error Examples\n\nContent: A1-3.3.1 Example of the Signal Status When an Error is Generated During Transfer Operations A1-3.3.1.1 Stocker Side Error Generation A1-3.3.1.1.1 Stocker Side Signals — When an error is generated, the BUSY signal must stay ON. This is to prevent secondary accidents due to the other device operating on its own. A1-3.3.1.1.2 OHS Side Signals — When an error is generated, each signal (except for the READY signal) should remain in the status it was in at the time of the error. The READY signal should go OFF. A1-3.3.1.2 OHS Side Error Generation A1-3.3.1.2.1 OHS Side Signals — When an error is generated, each signal should remain in the status it was in at the time of the error. The READY signal should be OFF. The ES signal should be OFF. HO_AVBL should be OFF. A1-3.3.1.2.2 Stocker Side Signals — When an error is generated, only the BUSY signal should go ON. All remaining signals should go OFF. A1-3.3.2 Recovery Sequences A1-3.3.2.1 Should an error occur during transfer operations (refer to\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.3  Stocker (Active Type) Error Examples (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.3  Stocker (Active Type) Error Examples\n\nContent: Tables 3 and 4), the recovery should begin by returning the carrier to the stocker or OHS. Then, the error should be recovered. The four recovery scenarios are: 1. Load operation, carrier is returned to the OHS. 2. Load operation, carrier is returned to the stocker. 3. Unload operation, carrier is returned to the OHS. 4. Unload operation, carrier is returned to the stocker. A1-3.3.3 Recovery Method A1-3.3.3.1 Stocker Side • In the case of sequences 2 and 3 (above), the load/unload sequence should be started over from the beginning. • In the case of sequences 1 and 4 (above) the corresponding transfer operation should be considered completed.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-3.3.3.2  OHS Side\n\n• In the case of sequences 1 and 4 (above) the corresponding transfer operation should be considered completed.\n• In the case of sequences 2 and 3 (above), the load/unload sequence should be started over from the beginning.  \nA1-3.4  If the stocker is the active side of the interbay AMHS (i.e., OHS and stockers) it is conceivable that the loader will interfere with the OHS passing by the stocker in failure scenarios.  As a result of this possibility, it is necessary for interbay AMHS equipment makers to establish an OHS “PASS OK” signal separate from the SEMI E84 interlock.  However, this note has no direct bearing on the contents of SEMI E84.  Therefore, readers of SEMI E84 should only treat this as a reference item.  \nPass Interlock  \nInterlock Signal\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4  Errors and Automated Recovery (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4  Errors and Automated Recovery\n\nContent: A1-4.1 This section describes recommendations for implementation of errors and the associated recovery procedures for Interbay OHS (Active Vehicle) and Intrabay OHT, definition of practical implementation of the HO_AVBL and ES signals, and examples of various L_REQ and U_REQ sequences. NOTE 6: This application note assumes an SEMI E84 implementation where one parallel I/O device per loadport is used. A1-4.2 During the first few sequences of the SEMI E84 protocol before the carrier transfer begins if an error occurs the active vehicle should send an error to the host but automatically recover without human intervention. The active vehicle should automatically recover any SEMI E84 error up to the BUSY ON state. A1-4.3 Definition of Automated Recovery — If an error occurs the active vehicle should send an Unsuccessful Transfer Complete command to the HOST, then the HOST will send the active vehicle an alternate location. SEMI E82 Intrabay SEM defines this recovery procedure in detail. Table A1-5 shows\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4  Errors and Automated Recovery (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4  Errors and Automated Recovery\n\nContent: some specific scenarios where the active vehicle should automatically recover. Table A1-5 Example Automatic Recover Scenarios\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.4  HO_AVBL Signal\n\nA1-4.4.1  The HO_AVBL signal specifies if the Passive Equipment is available to accept a Load / Unload from the Active Equipment.  The HO_AVBL should also be used to identify situations where harm to the carrier or product may exist.  The HO_AVBL signals are loadport specific and should not apply to all of the loadports on the equipment.  Table A1-6 shows some specific scenarios for the HO_AVBL Signal.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # Table A1-6  Example HO_AVBL Scenarios\n\n#1  During normal load/unload operation the presence and placement sensors may turn on/off for a very short period.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.5  ES Signal\n\nA1-4.5.1  The ES signal allows the Passive Equipment to signify to the Active Equipment any specific instance where the material, product, or operation is in jeopardy.  The ES Signal is not loadport specific but rather tool specific.  That means, for example, if an EMO is pressed on the Passive Equipment the ES signal should be OFF on all SEMI E84 loadports.  Table A1-7 shows some specific scenarios for the ES Signal.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.6  L_REQ and U_REQ Signals (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.6  L_REQ and U_REQ Signals\n\nContent: A1-4.6.1 When the L_REQ and U_REQ signals are turned OFF they verify the completion of the Load/Unload sequence as indicated by the presence/placement sensors on the load port. A1-4.6.1.1 Here are some practical examples of using these signals. 1) During a Load both Presence and Placement sensors are ON once the carrier is detected. This should signal the L_REQ signal to turn OFF. The L_REQ signal should typically not turn OFF unless both the presence and placement sensors are ON. 2) When delivering, the Active Equipment should not release the FOUP until L_REQ is OFF. 3) During an Unload both Presence and Placement sensors are OFF once the carrier is not detected. This should signal the U_REQ signal to turn OFF. The U_REQ signal should typically not turn OFF unless both the presence and placement sensors are OFF. 4) The L_REQ and U_REQ signals should turn off immediately after the presence and placement sensors have turned ON (load) or OFF (unload). There should be no delay timer between the presence\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.6  L_REQ and U_REQ Signals (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.6  L_REQ and U_REQ Signals\n\nContent: and placement sensor ON/OFF and L_REQ / U_REQ OFF. 5) During an Unload, once the active vehicle has fully gripped the FOUP, in most cases the vehicle should ignore the response from the U_REQ signal until completion of its move. For example, the OHT vehicle should not stop $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m } - 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ above the loadport, check the status of U_REQ and then complete its move. The OHT should fully complete its move, check U_REQ and finish the E84 sequence. If the U_REQ signal is still high after the completion of its move and the active vehicle can be certain the carrier is safely and securely contained aboard the vehicle, in some cases the vehicle should abort the E84 sequence and continue normally to its destination.\n\nSEMI E84-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR ENHANCED CARRIER HANDOFF PARALLEL I/O INTERFACE - # A1-4.7  Error Messages\n\nA1-4.7.1  Interlock timeouts are required to detect handoff sequence errors between the active and passive equipment.

Originally published June 1999; previously published November 2001.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 This specification defines the dimensional requirements for the interbay load ports of $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ AMHS equipment. It is intended to promote a list of required features and dimensions that define the physical interfaces between different types of interbay equipment, to facilitate the use of different automated transport systems in order to meet the different material handling requirements found throughout the factory. This is done by defining six options of interfaces that both the stocker and interbay transport system must comply with. Options defined are as follows: • Option A: Active transport loads a carrier to an internal stocker position • Option B: Active transport loads a carrier to an external stocker position • Option C: Passive transport presents a carrier to an internal stocker position • Option D: Passive transport presents a carrier to an external stocker position (kinematic coupling pin pick-up) • Option E: Passive transport presents a carrier to an external stocker\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: position (conveyor flange pick-up) • Option F: Passive transport presents a carrier to an external stocker position for pickup with either (a) all 3 kinematic pins, (b) all 3 secondary kinematic pins or (c) top robotic flange. Carrier is oriented with front of carrier perpendicular to load face plane.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This is a standard covering physical interface of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ AMHS interbay equipment only.  Similar requirements covering $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ AMHS intrabay equipment are covered in SEMI E15.1.  \n2.2  This specification does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this specification to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  This standard does not specify that every type of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ stocker has to interface with every type of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ interbay transport system.  It only specifies six different options of physical interface.  Within any option however, all stockers must be able to physically interface with all interbay transports.  This standard only specifies single carrier handoff and not dual simultaneous handoffs as implied by the dimensions in the rest of this document.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E1.9 — Mechanical Specification for Cassettes Used to Transport and Store $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ Wafers  \nSEMI E15 — Specification for Tool Load Port  \nSEMI E15.1 — Specification for $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ Tool Load Port  \nSEMI E47.1 — Provisional Mechanical Specification for Boxes and Pods Used to Transport and Store $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ Wafers  \nSEMI E57 — Mechanical Specification for Kinematic Couplings Used to Align and Support $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ Wafer Carriers  \nSEMI E84 — Specification for Enhanced Carrier Handoff Parallel I/O Interface  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 5  Terminology (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: NOTE 1: For many of the used terms, see SEMI E15.1. 5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms 5.1.1 AMHS — Automated Material Handling Systems 5.2 Definitions 5.2.1 active interbay transport system — an interbay transport system that transfers the carrier to and from the stocker interbay load port itself using robotics that are located on the transport. 5.2.2 drive through interbay transport (DT) — an interbay transport system where the track runs internal to the stocker boundary for the entire width of the stocker (Option C application defined in $\\ P 7 . 5 . 3 )$ . 5.2.3 external stocker load port — an interbay load port that is external to the stocker equipment boundary similar to a shelf or ledge on the stocker. 5.2.4 horizontal transfer interbay transport $( H T ) \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } \\mathrm { a n }$ interbay transport system where a section of the track transfers or slides into an opening in the side of the stocker to present a passive interbay transport system to the stocker robot (Option C application\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 5  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: defined in $\\ P 7 . 5 . 3 )$ . 5.2.5 interbay load port — the interface location on a stocker where the interbay transport places wafer carriers to allow the stocker to store the carriers. 5.2.6 interbay transport system — is defined as the track and vehicle (if applicable) that transports the carrier to and from the interbay stockers. 5.2.7 internal stocker load port — an interbay load port that is recessed from the stocker equipment boundary (a cavity or cutout in the stocker). 5.2.8 overhead delivery — an interbay transport system that transfers the carrier to and from the stocker interbay load port itself from directly above the load port (raises and lowers the carrier to the load port). 5.2.9 passive interbay transport system — an interbay transport system that requires the stocker to transfer the carrier to and from the stocker interbay load port (stocker has robotics that transfers the carrier). 5.2.10 stocker — an AMHS storage device.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 6  Ordering Information (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 6  Ordering Information\n\nContent: 6.1 Per $\\ S 6$ of SEMI E15, except for $\\ P [ 6 . 1 . 3$ and ${ \\ P } 6 . 1 . 4$ . 6.2 The user and AMHS supplier will jointly own the responsibility of defining the height of the interbay load port defined by dimension H (the distance from the horizontal datum plan to the raised floor). 6.3 The user must specify which of the options (defined in $\\ P 7 . 5$ ) is required for each interbay load port. The user must also specify which carrier will be used: front-opening box or open cassette. 6.3.1 If the user specifies Option C, the user must also specify: a) Which type of interbay transport system will be used. Dimensions A1 and S do not apply if it is a drive through (DT) type.

Figure 11 is only applicable for open cassette type carriers. 7.2.1 Except for option F, the carrier shall be loaded and unloaded with its front parallel to and away from the load face plane as illustrated in Figures 1–11. 7.3 The wafers in the front-opening box are to be oriented horizontally face up with zero nominal tilt at the time they are placed on the load port. The tolerance in the horizontal plane is determined by the registration and alignment feature between the carrier and the load port, as specified in SEMI E57. The wafers in the front-opening open cassette are to be oriented horizontally face up with 2 degree nominal tilt at the time they are placed on the load port. 7.4 Dimension H of the\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: load port is to be specified by the user and the AMHS supplier $( \\ P 6 . 2 )$ . The height of the interbay transport system is to be fully configurable using the track hangers. The precision with which the interbay transport delivery system height must be maintained is dictated by the needs of the interbay load port. 7.5 AMHS interbay equipment load ports must conform to one of the following configuration options (see $\\ P ( 6 . 3 )$ . 7.5.1 In Option A, an active transport loads a carrier to an internal stocker position. The stocker interbay load port must therefore maintain the center exclusion volume below the HDP defined in $\\ P 7 . 6$ and shown in Figures 1 and 10. This exclusion volume in the stocker load port facilitates carrier delivery from an active interbay transport system. The interbay transport may transfer the carrier to the passive stocker using the SEMI standard carrier handling features, which are compatible with the exclusion volumes in the stocker defined in this standard.\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: Examples include the secondary set of kinematic pins and the top robotic flange. The use of the primary kinematic pins is reserved for the stocker load port. The two front kinematic pins and a guide are used to interface with a SEMI defined accurate outer carrier surface defined in SEMI E47.1 (front-opening box) or SEMI E1.9 (open cassette). Refer to Figure 1 and the Related Information for detail. The open volume internal to the stocker above the HDP is defined by dimensions A1, S, and a clearance C3 above the maximum height of the carrier. 7.5.2 In Option B, an active transport loads a carrier to an external stocker position. The stocker interbay load-port must therefore maintain the two fork-lift or con-veyor exclusion volumes as defined in SEMI E15.1 to allow for an active interbay transport system to transfer a carrier to the fork-lift or conveyor rails. The stocker interbay load port must also be open from above to facilitate delivery from an overhead transport system. The open volume required\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: for vertical delivery is de-fined by a projection of the stocker load port area. The stocker interbay load port features, exclusion volumes, and dimensions are defined in SEMI E15.1 with the exception of dimension S and H. This option is illustrated in Figure 2. 7.5.3 In Option C, a passive transport presents a carrier to an internal stocker position. The passive interbay transport must therefore maintain the center exclusion volumes defined in $\\ P 7 . 6$ and shown in Figures 3, 4, and 10 in order to facilitate automatic carrier transfer by the active stocker. The stocker may transfer the carrier to the passive interbay transport system using the SEMI standard carrier handling features, which are compatible with the exclusion volumes in the interbay transport system defined in this standard. Examples include the secondary set of kinematic pins and the top robotic flange. The use of the primary kinematic pins is reserved for the interbay transport system. The two front kinematic pins and a guide are\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: used to interface with a SEMI defined accurate outer carrier surface defined in SEMI E47.1 (front-opening box) or SEMI E1.9 (open cassette). Refer to Figure 3 and the Related Information for detail. The open volume internal to the stocker to allow for the interbay transport to enter is defined by dimensions T3 and C5. This option is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. 7.5.3.1 Option C allows for two different types of interbay transport $( \\ P 6 . 3 . 1 )$ . The first type is a drive though (DT) interbay transport that will drive through the entire length of the stocker as illustrated in Figure 3. Dimensions A1 is therefore not applicable for this type of Option C interbay transport delivery. The other type of interbay transport is a horizontal transfer (HT) were a section of the track slides or advances into a predefined open volume in the side of the stocker as illustrated in Figure 4. Dimensions A1 and S are applicable for this type of Option C interbay transport delivery. 7.5.3.2 Option C prime $(\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: \\mathbf { C } ^ { \\prime } )$ is different from Option C in that the pins used to transfer the carrier are different. In Option $C ^ { \\prime }$ , the transport vehicle uses the two front secondary, and single rear primary kinematic pins. This enables the stocker end-effector to use the two front primary pins and be of a wider configuration (see Figure 3a). All elevation dimensions for C’ are the same as for Option C. $7 . 5 . 4 \\ \\mathrm { I n }$ Option D, a passive transport presents a carrier to an external stocker position. The passive interbay transport must maintain the center exclusion volume shown in Figures 5 and 10 to allow for the stocker to use the secondary kinematic pins or top robotic flange to transfer the carrier. No open volume internal to the stocker is required. 7.5.4.1 Option D prime (D’) is different from Option D in that the pins used to transfer the carrier are different. In Option ${ \\bf D } ^ { \\prime }$ , the transport vehicle uses the two front secondary, and single rear\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: primary kinematic pins. This enables the stocker end-effector to use the two front primary pins and be of a wider configuration (see Figure 4a). All elevation dimensions for Option ${ \\bf D } ^ { \\prime }$ are the same as for Option D. 7.5.5 In Option E, a passive transport presents a carrier to an external stocker position. The passive interbay transport must maintain the side fork-lift/conveyor rail exclusion volumes shown in Figure 6 to allow the stocker to use the fork-lift/conveyor rails to transfer the carrier. No open volume internal to the stocker is required. 7.5.6 In option F and $\\mathrm { F ^ { \\prime } }$ the carrier is oriented with the front of the carrier perpendicular to the load face plane by a passive transport for pickup by an active stocker. In option F the transport uses the kinematic coupling pins (all 3 may be used) and the stocker uses either the secondary kinematic coupling pins (all 3 accessible) or the top robotic flange for pickup. In Option $\\mathbf { F } ^ { \\prime }$\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: (F Prime) the transport uses the kinematic coupling pins, the secondary kinematic coupling pins or the conveyor runners, and the stocker uses the top robotic flange for pickup. 7.6 The center exclusion volume below the horizontal datum plane of the stocker for Option A (¶7.5.1) or interbay transport system for Options C and D $\\ P 7 . 5 . 3$ and $\\ P 7 . 5 . 4 )$ , is defined by dimensions H2, A2, and D (Figure 1 and 10). For Options C (¶7.5.3) and D (¶7.5.4), there are additional requirements that the center exclusion volume, defined by H2 and A2 extend from the facial datum plane a distance D10 (¶6.3.1 and $\\ P ( 6 . 3 . 2 )$ , increase both in depth de-fined by dimension H4 and in width defined by dimension A3 from the plane defined by dimension D10 extending outwards for the rest of the interbay transport system. The conveyor flange exclusion volume below the horizontal datum plane of the interbay transport system $( \\ P 7 . 5 . 4 )$ , is defined by dimensions H2, H4, A6, A8, and D10 (Figure 6).\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: The center exclusion volume below the horizontal datum plane of the stocker for option F is defined by Figure 10, “Exclusion zone detail for option $\\mathbf { F } ^ { \\prime }$ . No exclusion volumes are required for option $\\mathrm { \\nabla { \\ F ^ { \\prime } } }$ since stocker access is with the top robotic flange only. These exclusion volumes need to be open only during the carrier handoff between the stocker and the interbay transport system. For example, the stocker can temporarily occupy these exclusion volumes when transferring the carrier from the interbay load port to an internal shelf location. 7.7 Clearance C3 in Option A is defined with respect to the maximum dimensions of the carrier (defined in SEMI E47.1 for a box or in SEMI E1.9 for an open cassette), not to the rectangular wafer carrier envelope (defined in SEMI E15). 7.8 Dimension S specifies the required range for spacing between carrier centroids. 7.9 For active interbay transports (Option A) and passive interbay transports\n\nSEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI E85-0705SPECIFICATION FOR PHYSICAL AMHS STOCKER TO INTERBAYTRANSPORT SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: (Options C, D, and E and F), the communication method will be defined by SEMI E84 (same as OHT), and the available SEMI E84 connector areas are defined by the following dimensions, and are illustrated in Figure 9. Dimensions of the SEMI E84 connector zone are as follows: Width (measured from $\\mathrm { B D P } ) = 2 2 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ Depth (measured from Stocker facial plane) $= 2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ Height (measured from HDP) $= 3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ NOTE 2: The bottom of the SEMI E85 exclusion volumes defines the top of the SEMI E84 connector zones. For Option A, the top of the connector zone is defined by dimension H2. For Option B, the top of the connector zone is defined by dimension H0.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on July 19, 2001. R1-1 Except for Option F and $\\mathrm { \\nabla { \\ F ^ { \\prime } } }$ , the carrier may only rest on two of the three kinematic pins as defined in SEMI E57 to allow for transfer using the secondary set of kinematic pins. The AMHS supplier must allow the rear of the carrier to rest on a SEMI defined surface defined in SEMI E47.1 (front-opening box) or SEMI E1.9 (open cassette) to ensure the carrier is properly supported. The AMHS supplier should also investigate the stability of the FOUP if it rests on only two pins. One possible solution would be to add a lead-in or retaining feature that interfaces with a SEMI defined outer carrier surface defined in SEMI E47.1 (front-opening box) or SEMI E1.9 (open cassette).

R1-3 It is recommended that the systems that deliver carriers to AMHS interbay load ports have a mechanism to correct for misalignment of storage devices and load ports.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 16, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published September 1999.  \nE This standard was editorially modified in October 2004 to correct an editorial error in the title.  \nNOTICE:  This document was completely rewritten in 2004.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 1 Purpose\n\n1.1 The purpose of this guide is to provide a consistent set of terminology and describe a simplified, but constructive, experimental approach to planning and performing a measurement system analysis (MSA).  \n1.2 The goal of an MSA is to characterize the performance capability of the measurement system (MS) as it is intended to be used in a manufacturing or laboratory setting.  \n1.2.1 Accurately identifying the MS bias and the size and nature of all sources of variability allows one to determine whether the MS is capable of performing its intended function.  Moreover, a well-designed MSA can be used to identify and quantify areas that need the most improvement.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 2 Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This guide covers procedures for determining specific measures of MS capability including: measurement variability (i.e., reproducibility) under a variety of conditions, including effects of repeatability, load-unload, and time, and bias, including bias-related linearity, stability, and matching tolerance. 2.2 This guide also covers secondary metrics such as precision-over-tolerance (P/T) ratio and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 2.3 The primary focus of this guide is on determining measurement capability of automated wafer MSs under normal operating conditions, but the definitions and methodologies are extendible to many other measurement situations involving automated measurements on units such as processed dice, packaged devices, flat panel displays, piece parts, etc. 2.4 While there is no universally accepted correct way to conduct an MSA, the approach described in this document is supported in the technical literature (see Section 11) and congruent with practices advocated in ISO 5725-2. The procedures given in this guide represent an\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 2 Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: approach to the conduct of an MSA and provide basic reference methods that should serve for a variety of applications. Other methods may be appropriate in certain circumstances. 2.5 The procedures in this guide that are intended to separate the various sources of nonsystematic (i.e., random) errors are based on the use of factorial experiments and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Because the primary focus of this guide is on evaluation of automated MSs, the variability introduced by different operators is expected to be minimal.

Methodology for establishing and maintaining MS control is beyond the scope of this guide.  Such methodology should be a part of a quality management system, such as that mandated by ISO 9000 or similar standards.  Additional guidance for laboratories without established procedures may be found in the ASTM Manual on Presentation of Data and Control Chart Analysis.1  \n3.2 This guide does not address those aspects of measurement uncertainty associated with change in the object being measured, either spatially or temporally.  \n3.3 This guide does not address determination of measurement capability in the case of destructive measurements on samples, or when the MS alters the object being measured as a result of making the measurement.  \n3.4 This guide does not apply to inter-laboratory experiments designed to measure inter-laboratory precision of test methods.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 4 Referenced Standards\n\n4.1 ISO Standards2  \nANSI/ISO Z540-2 — Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement  \nANSI/ISO/ASQC A3534-1 — Statistics – Vocabulary and Symbols – Part 1: Probability and General Statistical Terms.  \nISO 3534-3 — Statistics – Vocabulary and Symbols – Part 3: Design of Experiments.  \nISO 5725-2 — Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results – Part 2: Basic method for the determination of repeatability and reproducibility of a standard measurement method.  \nISO 9000 Quality management systems Fundamentals and vocabulary, 2000.  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5 Terminology\n\n5.1 Terminology in this section that is not directly used in this guide, is likely to be encountered while conducting an MSA.  \n5.2 Definitions of many other terms related to metrology and statistics can be found in VIM,3 ANSI/ISO/ASQC A3534-1, and ISO 3534-3.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: 5.3.1 accuracy — closeness of agreement between a test result or the mean of a group of test results made on an object and its true value. 5.3.1.1 Discussion — Accuracy depends on both the precision and bias of the measurement process. Since random components of error (resulting in imprecision) and systematic components of error (resulting in bias) cannot be completely separated in routine use, the reported accuracy must be interpreted as a combination of these two elements. 5.3.2 bias — difference between the population mean of the test results from a measurement process and the true (accepted reference) value of the property being measured. 5.3.2.1 Discussion — Bias is a systematic component of measurement uncertainty. One or more systematic error components may contribute to the bias. The true value and the population mean are both unknown. The true value may be estimated with the use of a consensus value. If sufficient measurements are made to adequately mitigate the effects of measurement variability, the population mean may be\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: estimated from the sample mean $$ { \\overline { { x } } } = { \\frac { 1 } { n } } \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } x _ { i } $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l } { { \\overline { { x } } } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ sample mean, $\\begin{array} { r l } { n } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ number of measurements, and $\\begin{array} { r l r } { x _ { i } } & { { } = } & { i ^ { t h } } \\end{array}$ measurement value. 5.3.3 calibration — set of operations that establish the relationship between values of quantities indicated by a measurement system (MS) and the corresponding values assigned to reference materials. 5.3.3.1 Discussion — The purpose of calibration is to reduce or eliminate bias in the MS. 5.3.4 certified reference material (CRM) — reference material, one or more of whose property values are certified by a technically valid procedure, accompanied by or traceable to a certificate or other documentation issued by a certifying body. 5.3.5 coefficient of variation (CV) — population standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean value. 5.3.5.1\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: Discussion — CV can be estimated from the sample standard deviation, $s$ , and the sample mean, $\\overline { { x } }$ of a distribution as follows: $$ C V = \\frac { s } { \\overline { { x } } } { \\times } 1 0 0 \\ $$ CV is an appropriate measure of variability only when the sample standard deviation is proportional to the mean; otherwise it varies with the value of the measurand. If the sample standard deviation is independent of the value of the measurand, it is more appropriate to use it directly rather than CV. 5.3.6 effect ⎯ change in the expected value of a given response due to the change of a given factor from one level to another. It is a measure of influence that a particular variable level has on the output variable. 5.3.6.1 fixed effect — variable for which estimates of the mean are obtained for each level. 5.3.6.2 random effect — variable for which estimates of the mean are not obtained for each level; rather the variable is treated as a variance component. 5.3.7 factor — predictor variable whose level is changed with the intent\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: of assessing its effect on the response variable (in a designed experiment) [adapted from ISO 3534-3]. 5.3.7.1 crossed factor(s) — two factors are crossed when every level of one factor appears with every level of the second factor. 5.3.7.2 fixed factor — factor that has either all of its levels represented in an experiment or levels selected by a nonrandom process. 5.3.7.3 nested factor(s) — factor that has a different set of levels appearing within each level of a second factor. Factor B is nested in factor A when randomization of the levels of factor B is restricted to specific levels of factor A. 5.3.7.4 random factor — factor that has randomly sampled levels from a population of levels. 5.3.8 gage — alternate spelling of gauge. 5.3.9 gauge — instrument used to assign a value to a quantitative or qualitative characteristic of a physical entity or phenomenon. 5.3.10 interaction — effect for which the apparent influence of one factor on the response variable depends upon one or more other factors [ISO 3534-3]. 5.3.11 level ⎯ value of a\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: factor (in a designed experiment) [adapted from ISO 3534-3]. Also called “setting of a variable.” 5.3.12 linearity — absence of changes in variability or bias as measurements are made at different points within the measurement range. 5.3.12.1 Discussion Traditional definitions of linearity ignore the fact that variability can change over the measurement range, as well as bias. The assumption of constant variability over the measurement range should be verified during the MS analysis. 5.3.13 lower specification limit (LSL) — value of an attribute below which a product is said to be nonconforming. 5.3.14 matching tolerance $( \\varDelta _ { m } )$ — difference in bias for any two measurement systems (MSs) of the same kind made under the conditions of reproducibility. 5.3.15 measurand — particular attribute of a phenomenon, body or substance subject to measurement. [VIM] 5.3.16 measurement resolution, of a gauge — smallest difference in measurand that can be meaningfully distinguished by the gauge. 5.3.17 measurement subsystem ⎯ any set of\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: entities, processes, or conditions that share a common purpose in the measurement. 5.3.17.1 Discussion — A measurement subsystem may contain one or more of its own subsystems. For example, a wafer handling mechanism may be further composed of wafer loading and wafer positioning subsystems. 5.3.18 measurement system (MS) — all entities, procedures, and conditions that can influence the test result obtained with a given measurement process. 5.3.18.1 Discussion — The MS may include, but is not limited to, the gauge, operators, setup mechanics, wafers, locations on a wafer, environmental conditions, software used by the gauge, measurement method, etc. The MS may be comprised of measurement subsystems. 5.3.19 measurement system analysis (MSA) procedure in which relevant sources of bias and variability associated with a measurement system (MS) are estimated. NOTE 2: MSA is also sometimes called gauge (or gage) repeatability and reproducibility (GRR or GR&R). 5.3.20 nested design — experimental design in which different levels of one factor\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: appear in each level of a second factor. 5.3.21 population standard deviation $( \\sigma )$ — square root of the population variance. 5.3.22 population variance $( \\sigma ^ { 2 } ) \\mathrm { ~ ~ { ~ - ~ } ~ }$ measure of dispersion associated with a population distribution. 5.3.22.1 Discussion — For continuous distributions, the population variance is the second central moment. 5.3.23 precision — general estimator of the variability of a measurement process about the mean value of the test results obtained. 5.3.23.1 Discussion Precision is a random component of measurement uncertainty. Unless the measurement process is in a state of statistical control, the precision of the process has no meaning. Since the precision is poorer for greater dispersion of the test results, specific measures of variability (such as repeatability and reproducibility) are actually direct measures of the imprecision of the measurement process. 5.3.24 precision-to-tolerance (P/T) ratio — ratio of the precision of a measurement system (MS) to the tolerance (i.e.,\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: absolute magnitude of the full range of the product specification). 5.3.24.1 Discussion — If the variability associated with the measurement of a parameter by an MS is very small compared with the width of the specification range, the probability of obtaining a test result outside the specification limits when the value of the parameter actually lies within the specification limits (or conversely) is quite small. On the other hand, if the ratio is too large, the probability of obtaining a false test result is much greater. 5.3.25 predictor variable — variable that can contribute to the explanation of the outcome of a designed experiment. Also called “input variable,” “descriptor variable,” and “explanatory variable.” 5.3.25.1 Discussion — The term “independent variable” is not recommended as a synonym due to potential confusion with independence. 5.3.26 product standard deviation (σProduct) population standard deviation associated with the distribution of values of all possible realizations of a property of an entity manufactured under\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: specified conditions. 5.3.26.1 Discussion — The product variability may be estimated by taking a representative sample from the population and calculating its sample standard deviation $( s _ { P r o d u c t } )$ taking suitable account of MS variation (see Section 10.2). 5.3.27 reference material — material or substance, one or more of whose property values are sufficiently homogeneous and well established to be used for the calibration of a MS, for the assessment of a measurement method or for assigning values to materials. 5.3.28 repeatability $( \\sigma _ { r } )$ — variability associated with repeated measurements taken under repeatability conditions. 5.3.29 repeatability conditions — test conditions involving acquisition of a series of test results with the same test protocol and MS setup in the same laboratory by the same operator on the same equipment in the shortest practical period of time on the same test wafer without explicit recalibration. 5.3.29.1 Discussion — The acquisition of test data under repeatability conditions is\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: intended to avoid influences of long-term drift, operator or MS differences, material variability, and the like. Recalibration of the MS is expected to cause discontinuous differences in test results. However, if recalibration is required by the test protocol or is internal to the MS, it is considered to be an allowable variation in determination of repeatability. 5.3.30 reproducibility $\\left( \\sigma _ { R } \\right)$ — variability associated with the measurement system (MS) when measurements are made under different (but typical) conditions. 5.3.30.1 Discussion — Changes associated with subsystems or test conditions are potential sources of variation to be estimated. Repeatability is one source of variation. Other relevant sources of variability may include time, operator, setup procedure, wafer (of like variety), measurement location, test instrumentation, environmental conditions, etc. Although the total number of contributors to the variance can be exceedingly large, one typically focuses on a subset that accounts for a significant\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: portion of the expected MS variability. For clarity, the selected subset should be reported together with the reproducibility. If $q$ different conditions introduce variability into the measurement independently from one another, the variances add directly $$ \\sigma _ { R } = \\sqrt { \\sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { 3 } ^ { 2 } + \\ldots + \\sigma _ { q } ^ { 2 } } $$ and they may be separated by the use of judiciously designed experiments. 5.3.31 response variable — variable representing the outcome of a designed experiment. Also called “output variable.” 5.3.31.1 Discussion — The term “dependent variable” is not recommended as a synonym due to potential confusion with independence. 5.3.32 root sum of squares (RSS) difference — square root of the difference of the squares of two numbers. 5.3.33 root sum of squares (RSS) sum — square root of the sums of the squares of two or more numbers. 5.3.34 sample standard deviation (s) ⎯ square root of the sample variance. 5.3.35 sample variance $( s ^ { 2 } )$ — measure of\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: dispersion given by the average squared deviation from the mean for a set of numbers. 5.3.35.1 Discussion If $x _ { i }$ is an individual measurement, $\\textstyle { \\overline { { x } } }$ is the average across all measurements, and $n$ is the number of measurements, then $$ s ^ { 2 } = { \\frac { 1 } { n - 1 } } { \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( x _ { i } - { \\overline { { x } } } ) ^ { 2 } } $$ The denominator value of $n - 1$ is used instead of $n$ to make the sample variance an unbiased estimator of the population variance. 5.3.36 signal–to-noise ratio (SNR) — ratio of the variation in the manufactured product to the precision of the measurement system (MS). 5.3.36.1 Discussion — Because it is difficult to directly measure the standard deviation of the product without including variation due to the measurement instrument, SNR is generally defined as: $$ S N R = \\sqrt { \\frac { \\sigma _ { T o t a l } ^ { 2 } - \\sigma _ { R } ^ { 2 } } { \\sigma _ { R } ^ { 2 } } } $$ where $\\sigma _ { T o t a l } ^ { 2 }$ is an estimate of the total population\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 13)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: variance obtained from appropriate measurements of a large, representative sample of the product. 5.3.37 stability — absence of additional variability due to taking measurements over time (typically several days or longer). 5.3.38 statistical model ⎯ mathematical function relating one or more variables to known and measurable inputs plus one or more unknown stochastic (error) terms. 5.3.38.1 Discussion — A statistical model consists of three parts. The first part is the response variable that is being modeled. The second part is the deterministic or the systematic part of the model that includes predictor variables. Finally, the third part is the random error or stochastic part of the model, which can be quite elaborate. An example of a statistical model is: 5.3.41 uncertainty — parameter, associated with a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of values that can be reasonably attributed to the object being measured. 5.3.41.1 Discussion — Two types of measurement uncertainty are: Type A: uncertainty components evaluated by\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions (Part 14)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 5.3 Definitions\n\nContent: statistical methods and Type B: uncertainty components evaluated by other than statistical methods. 5.3.42 upper specification limit (USL) — value of an attribute above which a product is said to be nonconforming. 5.3.43 variable quantitative or qualitative characteristic of an object, processes, or state that may take on more than one value. 5.3.43.1 Discussion When the values occur unpredictably, it is a random variable. 5.3.44 variance — population variance (see Section 5.3.22).\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6 Goals of and Preliminary Steps in Planning an MSA (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6 Goals of and Preliminary Steps in Planning an MSA\n\nContent: 6.1 One major goal of an MSA is to determine MS reproducibility under the desired operating conditions. This may range from a simple repeatability study, to a complex determination of the relative contributions of many sources of MS variability using factorial experiments and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Some of the typical types of variability-determination goals to be met by an MSA include the following: 6.1.1 Determination of repeatability. $$ y _ { j } = \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { p } \\beta _ { i } x _ { i } + e _ { j } $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l r } { y _ { j } } & { { } = } & { j ^ { t h } } \\end{array}$ jth measurement, $p$ = number of input variables, $\\begin{array} { r l r } { \\bar { \\bf \\Phi } _ { x _ { i } } } & { { } = } & { { \\bf \\Phi } \\cdot { \\bf \\Phi } _ { i } ^ { t h } } \\end{array}$ input variable, $\\begin{array} { r l } { \\beta _ { i } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ its corresponding coefficient, and $\\begin{array} { r l } { e _ { j } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ error associated with the $j\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6 Goals of and Preliminary Steps in Planning an MSA (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6 Goals of and Preliminary Steps in Planning an MSA\n\nContent: ^ { t h }$ measurement. In many cases the error distribution(s) are specified before the model is fit (e.g., as normal). 5.3.39 tolerance — absolute magnitude of the full range of the product specification. 5.3.40 total variance $( \\sigma _ { T o t a l } ^ { 2 } ) \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } \\mathrm { s u m }$ of the product variance and the square of the reproducibility. 6.1.2 Determination of the effect of loading and unloading the wafer samples between measurements. 6.1.3 Determination of stability. NOTE 3: Stability may also have a bias component that can be confounded with the variability component of stability (see Section 6.2.3). 6.1.4 Assessment of the multiple factors that affect the MS variability, which requires the use of factorial experiments and ANOVA. 6.1.5 Assessment of the largest sources of variability in order to focus improvement efforts on the most critical sources. This identification can be made from the analysis of a properly designed and executed factorial experiment. 6.1.6 Once the\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6 Goals of and Preliminary Steps in Planning an MSA (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6 Goals of and Preliminary Steps in Planning an MSA\n\nContent: reproducibility is determined over the desired conditions, secondary metrics, such as P/T ratio and SNR can be easily calculated. $6 . 2 \\mathrm { A }$ second major goal of an MSA is to determine bias and bias-related considerations. In general, bias studies require standards or “golden wafers” with “known” true measurement values or agreed-upon consensus values. Corrective actions ranging from simple recalibration to repair of the MS may be required as a result of the bias determinations. Some of the typical elements of a bias study include:\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6.2.1 Determination of bias.\n\n6.2.2 Determination of linearity or whether bias is constant over the range of values that the metrology equipment will be used.  \nNOTE 4:  Linearity also may have a variability component.  \n6.2.3 Determination of the stability or whether the bias is constant over time.  \nNOTE 5:  Stability also may have a variability component (see Section 6.1.3).\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6.2.4 Determination of matching tolerance. (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6.2.4 Determination of matching tolerance.\n\nContent: NOTE 6: In the absence of certified or other reference materials, as required for a determination of bias, matching tolerance may be determined by measuring the same set of test materials on the two MSs whose matching is being evaluated. Although this alternate method does not provide a measure of the value of bias, the difference between the mean values measured on the two MSs is the same as the difference in bias. 6.3 Before undertaking an MSA, determine and list the specific goals to be attained by the MSA to be performed. 6.4 It must be emphasized that all of the procedures in this guide yield meaningful estimates only on instruments that are in statistical control. Therefore the first step in analyzing the capability of any MS is to establish that it is in statistical control through control charts or other accepted quality control techniques. Detailed discussion of these techniques is outside the scope of this guide (see Section 3.1). $6 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ I t }$ is also useful to review prior studies on the\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 6.2.4 Determination of matching tolerance.

These factors should be made explicit before an experiment can be appropriately designed or accurately analyzed. The most common sources include: Repeatability Load-unload operation Time over intervals of day(s) or week(s) Wafer handling hardware, including ability to place the measurement probe at the same location on the wafer Measurement software, including type, revision, or both Setup procedure Environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity Shift (may be confounded with environmental con ditions or time or both) Magnitudes of attribute(s) of test wafer(s) under investigation Operator (usually not significant for automated MSs) NOTE 7: The factors listed are all included under the term “reproducibility.” There is no common agreement as to what factors should be included in reproducibility. Therefore the selection and recording of the factors included in a particular MSA are especially\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 7 Procedure to Determine Reproducibility (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 7 Procedure to Determine Reproducibility\n\nContent: critical. NOTE 8: Variability associated with factors independent of the MS, such as true value differences in the item being measured, should not be included in reproducibility. Given the design of the MS, it may be necessary to estimate these sources of variability before they are removed from total variability. If such factors are included in the MS, as for example, when different sites on a wafer are measured, variability associated with these factors should be estimated and removed from total MS variability. Although variability due to the measurement process physically altering the measurand (i.e., the interaction between MS and wafer) should be included in reproducibility, consideration of this topic is beyond the scope of this guide (see Section 3.3). 7.2 Identify all factors outside of the MS for which an interaction with one or more factors within the MS may exist. Treat these factors as fixed factors and the interactions as random factors. NOTE 9: Typically, the only fixed factor considered is related\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 7 Procedure to Determine Reproducibility (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 7 Procedure to Determine Reproducibility\n\nContent: to the measured object, where making measurements at different locations, for different true values, or on different wafer types may be influenced by certain aspects of the MS. 7.3 Identify the nested factors and the factors in which they are nested. Several levels of nesting may exist for a given factor. NOTE 10: Nesting occurs when the measurement procedure causes a natural hierarchy of events to exist. For example, if repeatability is estimated by taking measurements with the wafer fixed in the gauge, and variability due to the loadunload operation is estimated by taking a second set of measurements after the wafer has been removed and reloaded, repeatability is nested in load-unload. The nesting occurs because each set of repeated measurements is unique to the load in which they appear. Nesting may also occur if a physical hierarchy exists, such as when both measurement locations (sites) and wafer type are fixed factors in an MSA (sites being nested in wafer type). 7.4 Select appropriate test wafers for the\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 7 Procedure to Determine Reproducibility (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # 7 Procedure to Determine Reproducibility\n\nContent: MSA. 7.4.1 In the most general case, many types of wafers should be used. These should be representative of the types and levels to be measured in practice by the MS under evaluation. 7.4.2 The test wafers should be as uniform as possible to prevent confounding of handling, loading, or positioning factors, if these are chosen to be examined. 7.4.3 It is necessary to use only one test wafer of each type selected. 7.4.4 Use the same test wafers throughout the MSA. 7.5 Prepare a statistical model for the MSA in order to plan and analyze it properly.

If CRMs are not available, use wafers with well accepted consensus values covering the range of values of the attributes to be measured. The reference materials should have characteristics similar to the wafers to be measured by the MS being evaluated or their values should be transferable to such wafers. NOTE 15: Bias cannot be determined if suitable reference materials are not available. In such situations, it is necessary to resort to correlation experiments to establish the systematic errors between different MSs. If the bias is not known, these systematic errors may confound the estimated reproducibility. 8.2 Select and implement the appropriate MS setup. 8.3 Determine if the MS needs to be calibrated.

To minimize systematic errors, randomize the sequence of measurements among the reference wafers for each daily measurement.

This value should not be significantly different from one. Otherwise, the MS exhibits nonlinearity. 8.6.5 Stability — Test for a significant difference between the full and reduced models given by Equations 7 and 9, respectively. If there is no significant difference, continue. Otherwise, bias is not stable over time. 8.6.6 Test for model lack of fit.

While there are several ways of implementing this procedure, in each case assume that the measurement results come from a normal distribution and then calculate the probability of obtaining the particular observed sample. Before calculating this probability value $\\overset { \\cdot } { p }$ -value), an a priori decision is made as to how small this $p$ -value has to be to warrant the conclusion that the hypothesis is unreasonable and hence it is unlikely that the observed distribution is normal. A level of 0.05 is commonly chosen and the sample is then tested. If the $p$ -value is greater than 0.05 (or the chosen test level, if different from 0.05), one accepts that the underlying distribution is normal. R2-1.2 Statistical tests for normality can be found in most commercial statistical software. Four common tests are\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R2-1 Testing for Normality (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R2-1 Testing for Normality\n\nContent: Andersen-Darling, Pearson’s Chi Square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Shapiro-Wilk. R2-1.3 As an example, the 25 observations shown in Table R2-1 are a random sample taken from a manufacturing process. A commonly used statistical package was used to generate the statistical tests mentioned above and the results obtained are shown in Table R2-2. Table R2-1 Measurement Data R2-1.4 Note that if we require a $p$ -value is less than or equal to 0.05 as a rejection criterion, none of these statistical procedures would reject normality for the manufacturing process measurements although the calculated $p$ -values are all different. R2-1.5 For some of these tests, software packages may rely on a combination of tabled values and interpolation to arrive at the answer. For that reason, the numbers given for the same test may vary depending on the software used.

To do so, calculate the ratio of the repeatability of each MS. When forming this ratio, place the larger value in the numerator. The hypothesis under consideration is that the repeatabilities are equal. When this is true, the ratio follows an $F$ distribution with $\\nu _ { 1 }$ degrees of freedom for the numerator and $\\nu _ { 2 }$ degrees of freedom for the denominator. R2-2.2 As a simple example, compare MS 1, which demonstrated a repeatability of 9.243 based on 25 observations, and MS 2, which demonstrated a repeatability of 7.658 based on 23 observations. The $F$ ratio is 1.207 with $\\nu _ { 1 } = 2 4$ degrees of freedom for the numerator and $\\nu _ { 2 } = 2 2$ degrees of freedom for the denominator. R2-2.3 The probability of seeing an $F$ value of 1.207 or larger, based on an $F$ distribution with these degrees of freedom is 0.330.

R3-1.2 A measurement model expresses each observed measurement value as the sum of a “true value” plus “bias” plus “random error.” The “true value” may be the actual value for the object being measured or the average population value if a sample of objects is measured in the MSA. The random error term is further broken up into contributions from all the significant sources of error under investigation. If an MSA is well designed, standard statistical techniques (such as ANOVA) can be used to estimate the standard deviation contribution from each source of error, and from this the repeatability, reproducibility and precision of the MS are determined. R3-1.3 Note that any MS that is composed of several measurement subsystems (such as spectrometry and ellipsometry), designed for the measurement of different characteristics or types of samples, should be treated as composed of separate MSs that need\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-1  Introduction\n\nContent: to be analyzed independently. R3-1.4 Writing an appropriate measurement model is the starting point, after which many software packages can be used to design the MSA and calculate ANOVA estimates from the resulting measurement data. R3-1.4.1 The model must indicate whether each source of variation, i.e., factor, is fixed or random. Variance components are only available for random factors. R3-1.4.2 The model must indicate which factors are crossed and which are nested.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model\n\nContent: R3-2.1 A wafer oxide thickness MS is under investigation. A wafer is placed in the gauge, which then automatically positions the wafer and takes a measurement. While the wafer is positioned, the measurement can be repeated as many times as desired. Sources of variability that might affect a measurement include basic repeatability on a positioned wafer, variability due to the automatic positioning process, variability over time and variability from measuring several different wafers (to cover a range of “true” measurement values). R3-2.2 An MSA that separates out all these possible sources of variability is the following: 10 wafers are chosen at random from normal production. Each wafer is put in the MS in a random order and measured 3 times at a single site (3 repeats) on day 1 (cycle 1). Immediately after the 30 measurements are recorded, the same measurement process is repeated on the 10 wafers (cycle 2). On day 2, the same wafers are again measured using exactly the same procedure. This is repeated for a total of 5\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model\n\nContent: days, yielding $3 \\times 1 0 \\times 2 \\times 5 =$ 300 measurements. R3-2.3 Assuming the MS has been calibrated (or bias is not a concern at the moment), a model for variability is constructed as follows: let $h = 1$ , 2, …, 5, index the days; let $k = 1 , 2 , . . . , 1 0$ , index the wafers; let $j = 1$ , 2, index the repositions (cycles) each day and let $i = 1$ , 2, 3, index the repeat measurements (taken under repeatability conditions) on a positioned wafer. R3-2.4 The model for the $i ^ { t h }$ measurement at the $j ^ { t h }$ repositioning on the ${ \\boldsymbol { k } } ^ { t h }$ wafer on the $h ^ { t h }$ day is: $$ M _ { h k j i } = \\mu + d _ { h } + w _ { k } + p _ { h k j } + r _ { h k j i } $$ where: Mhkji = measurement taken on day $h$ , wafer $k$ , cycle $j$ , and repeat $i$ , $\\begin{array} { r l } { \\mu } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ true oxide thickness average value for the population of wafers, $\\begin{array} { r l } { d _ { h } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ error term associated with the ${ \\boldsymbol { h\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model\n\nContent: } } ^ { t h }$ day (due to day-to-day stability variation), $\\begin{array} { r l } { \\boldsymbol { w _ { k } } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ offset from the average due to the true thickness of the film on wafer $k$ , $p _ { h k j } \\ =$ (short term) error due to the $j ^ { t h }$ positioning of the ${ \\boldsymbol { k } } ^ { t h }$ wafer on the $\\boldsymbol { h } ^ { t h }$ day, and $r _ { h k j i } =$ repeatability error term. R3-2.5 In this model, the quantities $d _ { h } , p _ { h k j } .$ , and $r _ { h k j i }$ are random error terms. They are usually assumed to have a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviations $\\sigma _ { d } .$ , $\\sigma _ { p }$ , and $\\sigma _ { r }$ , respectively. The wafer term $w _ { k }$ may be either a random term or a “fixed effect,” depending on whether we consider the wafers measured to be a random sample from the entire population of possible wafers or a fixed population used for experimental purposes. In either case, the estimates of repeatability and reproducibility\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model\n\nContent: will be the same. R3-2.6 When error terms are known to have nonnormal distributions, special methods and/or software (beyond the scope of this guide) are needed. NOTE 1: The model might also include a wafer-by-day random error term $w d _ { h k }$ , if it is suspected that measurements made from day to day on some wafers might vary differently than measurements made from day to day on other wafers, and it is desired to obtain an estimate of this component of reproducibility. R3-2.7 Reproducibility includes everything but waferto-wafer true thickness variability, so $$ \\sigma _ { R } = \\sqrt { \\sigma _ { d } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { p } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { r } ^ { 2 } } $$ R3-2.8 The ANOVA for this MSA provides all the variance estimates needed to calculate repeatability, reproducibility and precision. If the wafer term $w _ { k }$ is random, the ANOVA will also estimate $\\sigma _ { d }$ , which is useful for characterizing the wafer population variability. NOTE 2: When inputting this model into a statistical analysis\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R3-2  Example of a Measurement Model\n\nContent: program, the factors “day” and “wafer” are said to be crossed, since every wafer is measured on every day. The factor “positioning” is nested within wafer and day, and “repeatability” is the residual error term and is nested within positioning, wafer and day. A factor “A” is nested within another factor “B” if the levels or values of “A” are different for every level or value of “B.” R3-2.9 This example shows how a fairly complicated MSA can be set up. Each particular situation can lead to a different model and experimental design, depending upon the goals and agreed upon sources of (possibly significant) variation.\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF A MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS\n\nNOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI E89.

The MS was calibrated prior to the MSA, but the presence of bias would not affect the estimation of variance components as long as the amount of bias does not change over the course of the MSA. Different wafer types were selected to span the range of both possible wafer types and typical thicknesses. Five standard wafers were manufactured with characteristics as shown in Table R4-1. Table R4-1 Wafers Used for Analysis #1 UV ⎯ Ultra Violet, ARC ⎯ Anti Reflective Coating. R4-1.2 Wafers were measured on eight days, evenly spaced over a two-week period. On each day of the MSA each wafer was chosen twice, loaded each time into the gauge and measured twice without unloading. The order of selection was random. Therefore, on a given day, each wafer was measured exactly four times. Measurements were taken at three points on the wafers and averaged. The model (see\n\nSEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R4-1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E89-1104E GUIDE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS (MSA) - # R4-1  Introduction\n\nContent: Related Information 3) used was $\\begin{array} { r l } { \\boldsymbol { w _ { k } } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ offset from the average due to the true thickness of the film on wafer $k$ , $w d _ { h k } =$ effect or contribution due to wafer-by-day (wafer × day) interaction, $c _ { h k j } \\ =$ effect or contribution due to cycle $j .$ , nested in wafer $k$ and day $h$ , $r _ { h k j i } =$ effect or contribution due to repeat $i$ , nested in cycle $j$ , wafer $k$ , and day $h$ , and $e _ { h i j } \\ =$ residual effect due to all terms not included in the model.

(Methods of moments estimates were used. Negative variance components were set to zero). Sources of variation, such as $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ , are standard deviations found by taking the square roots of the appropriate variance component or sum of components.

Variance components are only estimated for random effects. If, for example, the five wafers were randomly selected from a distribution for a single wafer type, wafer variability would be included in the table and could be used to estimate the SNR. However, wafer variability would still not be part of $\\sigma _ { R }$ . For further details, see Related Information 3. R4-2.3 Reproducibility $( \\sigma _ { R } )$ is calculated as the square root of the sum of the estimates, i.e., $$ \\begin{array} { l } { { \\sigma _ { _ R } = \\sqrt { 1 2 . 1 3 4 8 + 0 . 1 2 5 6 + 0 + 4 6 2 . 9 8 6 9 + 0 . 8 4 4 6 } } } \\\\ { { \\qquad = 2 1 . 8 2 } } \\end{array} $$ R4-2.4 Repeatability $( \\sigma _ { r } )$ is estimated by the variance component corresponding to repeat and is equal to zero.

R4-2.7 Linearity is more difficult to estimate. In general, it is measured by the differences in variability associated with the different wafer types. The large wafer-by-day interaction suggests that there may be a linearity problem. An examination of the standard deviations for each group by day (see Figure R4-2) indicates that Wafer Type 5 (Deep UV Resist) may be responsible. These standard deviations were calculated from the four measurements made on every wafer each day. R4-2.8 When the variance components analysis was rerun, excluding Wafer Type 5 data, the new estimates obtained confirmed that Wafer Type 5 was problematic. An investigation into the potential cause suggested that the gauge was degrading the resist at the point of measurement, causing the readings to decrease over time. R4-2.9 If one were interested in measuring only Wafer Types 1 through 4 (employing a different gauge for Wafer Type 5, for example), the improved variance components estimates from Table R4-3 could be used.

The specification range for the product being measured was given as $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ \\AA ~ }$ , thus the $P / T$ ratio for the MS for Wafer Types 1 to 4 is $$ { \\frac { P } { T } } = { \\frac { 6 \\times 1 . 5 6 5 } { 1 0 } } \\times 1 0 0 = 9 3 . 9 \\% $$ Table R4-3 Variance Components Estimates for Wafers 1 – 4 Figure R4-2 Wafer Sigmas by Day Figure R4-3 Pareto Chart for Effects Sigmas (Wafer Type 5 Removed) R4-2.10.2 Because this is far above the generally acceptable maximum value of $30 \\%$ for a suitable MS, it might not be suitable for some applications.

So, it is recommended not to place the box flange seal in a narrow tunnel structure which have sharp edges but place it on a flat surface (or in a dimple that has chamfered edges).  \nFigure A-1 Usage of BOLTS Shelf (Adopter)  \nPlacement of a finger pinch sensor in the approximately $1 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ space behind SEMI E15.1 D1 is recommended.\n\nSEMI E92-0302ESPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT BOXOPENER/LOADER TO TOOL-INTEROPERABILITY STANDARD(BOLTS/LIGHT) - # A1-8  NOTICE: Adjustment of BOLTS/Light Unit\n\nA1-8.1  In order to maintain quick interchangeability and interoperability and quick attachment/detachment, adjustment capability should be provided separately by the box opener/loader and equipment to ensure the port is positioned correctly with respect to the wafer handling robot.  \nA1-8.2  As a result, adjustment means will be necessary on both the box opener/loader and the equipment. The box opener/loader may have a capability to calibrate its critical dimensions in advance, for example, the parallelism between bottom interface surface and HDP. In this case, it is not necessary to adjust the box opener/loader after installation.  The equipment should have a capability to adjust bottom interface plane with respect to the wafer-handling robot. In case of changing the box opener/loader in the field, adjustment might then not be necessary on both the box opener/loader and the equipment side.\n\nSEMI E92-0302ESPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT BOXOPENER/LOADER TO TOOL-INTEROPERABILITY STANDARD(BOLTS/LIGHT) - # A1-8.3  A fixture may help facilitate this adjustment.\n\nA1-8.4  If fine adjustment is needed after reattaching the box opener/loader (due to deficient adjustment of the box opener/loader or equipment side), it may be done on the equipment side by means of adjusting screws or other mechanism at bottom interface plane.\n\nSEMI E92-0302ESPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT BOXOPENER/LOADER TO TOOL-INTEROPERABILITY STANDARD(BOLTS/LIGHT) - # A1-9  NOTICE: Control Connection Area (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E92-0302ESPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT BOXOPENER/LOADER TO TOOL-INTEROPERABILITY STANDARD(BOLTS/LIGHT) - # A1-9  NOTICE: Control Connection Area\n\nContent: A1-9.1 Connection should be completed after sliding in the box opener/loader. Disconnection should be completed before sliding out the box opener/loader.
