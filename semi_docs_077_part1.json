Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on September 3, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to be published November 2003.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: $1 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { { \\ m } }$ silicon manufacturing product disposition is typically contingent on metrology equipment output. For example, a piece of work may be shipped, scrapped, or reworked based on information from one or more measured output characteristics. A cost model provides a mechanism for estimating the costs associated with operating metrology equipment under certain sets of assumptions and conditions. 1.2 This practice provides a standard methodology for metrology equipment suppliers and users to determine the cost due to misclassification of product because of measurement variability and bias during testing of the product for conformance to a specification. 1.3 This practice is intended to be useful for prepurchase evaluation of measurement equipment with different P/T (Precision/Tolerance) ratios. It is also intended to be useful when comparing the operation of a single measurement instrument in different throughput modes where P/T ratio changes with the throughput\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: mode utilized or other equipment setup factors. This practice can help users select the optimum cost solution based on their specific process capability and requirements. 1.4 Neither traditional cost elements (e.g., equipment, maintenance, operational, and staffing cost) nor product cost data are included in the practice; it is intended that each user should utilize appropriate data based on the applicable business model for the facility.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This practice covers a methodology to determine the costs associated with misclassification of product due to variability and bias of measurement equipment. These costs are associated with failing product that conforms with specifications and passing product that does not conform with specifications. 2.2 This practice can be applied to make relative cost comparisons between two or more measurement gauges operating under conditions specified by the user. These conditions may include any aspects of the measurement system affecting the measurement results directly or indirectly (e.g., ambient conditions, throughput, recipe). This practice can also be used to compare the relative costs of a single instrument under different operating conditions. 2.2.1 A measurement gauge is defined by a specific realization of systems and subsystems required to make measurements. Gauges that differ in at least one system or subsystem may be considered different for the purpose of comparison. 2.3 This\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: practice can be applied to any metrology equipment or to the metrology portion of any equipment that includes metrology. 2.4 This practice covers the case in which the metrology equipment is used to make binary decisions about the item being measured, that is, only two outcomes are possible (e.g., pass/fail, go/no-go, ship/scrap). Models for decisions with more than two outcomes, such as the binning of data, are beyond the scope of this practice. 2.5 To apply the formulae in this practice, the user must estimate either the probability density function (PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the process characteristic or characteristics of interest. The distributions can be based on a theoretical model or on empirical information obtained from manufacturing data. 2.6 To apply the formulae in this practice, the user must be able to estimate all biases and variances associated with the equipment being compared under the specified operating conditions and with respect to the\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: process characteristic(s) of interest. These values can be obtained from a measurement system capability analysis (see SEMI E89). 2.7 To apply the methodology of this practice, the user must estimate the costs of classification and misclassification due to decisions made as a result of measurements. Estimates of such costs are obtained from the business model used to describe the manufacturing process in which the measurements are performed. Consequently, different users may arrive at different estimates of costs because their computations may contain different elements. 2.8 The output of this practice is the cost component due to measurement variability and bias for each process characteristic and metrology system evaluated. 2.9 This practice does not consider costs associated with other components of uncertainty outside of measurement variability and bias. 2.10 Although it is focused on the issue of misclassification, the practice may be extended to include costs associated with\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: correct classification by the metrology equipment. 2.11 This practice was developed to evaluate metrology equipment used in silicon wafer manufacturing, but it may be extended to other types of metrology equipment by making suitable modifications. NOTICE: This practice does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Application of this practice requires that all measurement variances and biases, process characteristic distributions, and costs of classification and misclassification be accurately characterized. If this is not done, the resulting calculation may be in error. 3.2 Application of this practice also requires that measurement variances and biases be constant over the measurement range interval of interest. If this is not the case, the resulting calculation may be in error. 3.3 This practice considers only the case of two convolved distributions, process characteristic variability and measurement variability; consideration of additional distributions (such as would be required if the measurement bias or variance were assumed to be a function of the measured value) is beyond the scope of this practice. 3.4 Extension of the model to the cases of decisions based on (1) measurements on multiple gauges, (2) multiple inspections with the same gauge or (3) on multiple characteristics is\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: outside the scope of this practice, but information on such extensions is provided in Related Information 1 for the convenience of the user. 3.5 This model should not be confused with a cost-ofownership model, such as that developed in SEMI E35, which explicitly includes information on the cost elements involved.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 4  Referenced Standards\n\n4.1  SEMI Standards  \nSEMI E35 — Cost of Ownership for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Metrics  \nSEMI E89 Guide for Measurement System Capability Analysis  \nSEMI M1 Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI M27 — Practice for Determining the Precision over Tolerance Ratio of Test Equipment\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 4.2  ISO Document1\n\nInternational Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology, Second Edition [VIM]  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  General terminology related to metrology is defined in VIM.  \n5.2  Terminology relating to measurement system capability analysis is defined in SEMI E89.  \n5.3  Terminology related to silicon wafer technology is defined in SEMI M1.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 5.4  Other Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # 5.4  Other Definitions\n\nContent: 5.4.1 alpha error — the error that occurs when a conforming item is incorrectly reported as nonconforming.

This can be done using empirical data that represents the process. Although actual data may be used to create a discrete PDF, it is sometimes convenient to use the data to parametrically fit a PDF model (e.g., log normal). 7.2 Unless already known, establish the bias and standard deviation for each measurement gauge to be compared in accordance with SEMI E89. 7.3 In all cases take the measurement influence into account so that it does not broaden the PDF.

Because much of this is context specific, it would be impossible to cover all possible models. Other extensions to the model include relaxation of the assumption of constant variance, the introduction of variability in the bias, and the use of guard banding. The foundation of all these extensions, however, is the use of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta .$ $\\begin{array} { r c l } { \\pi } & { = } & { \\displaystyle \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { U S L } f ( x ) \\mathrm { d } x , ~ \\mathrm { a n d } } \\end{array}$ $f ( x ) =$ PDF of the characteristic being measured.\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # R1-2  Extension to Multiple Gauges (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # R1-2  Extension to Multiple Gauges\n\nContent: R1-2.1 To extend the model to multiple gauges, one must make the additional assumption that all measuring gauges are measuring the same characteristic. R1-2.1.1 In addition, define a conforming item as one that all gauges show the measured characteristic to be in specification.

As with the case of multiple gauges, several assumptions must be made. R1-4.1.1 The characteristics being measured are independent or an independent combination of their values is used.

R3-1 The model in this practice is used to assign probabilities (risks) to specification-related events. In general, there are two probabilities that are of interest. The first is the probability of getting a measurement outside of the specification range for a conforming item. This is often called the producer’s risk because conforming product would be needlessly rejected in this situation. The second probability is that of getting a measurement within specifications for a nonconforming item. Consumer’s risk is the term applied to this probability, since there is a chance of nonconforming product being accepted. R3-1.1 For the purposes of this standard, the event of rejecting an item\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 BACKGROUND OF THE METHODOLOGY (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 BACKGROUND OF THE METHODOLOGY\n\nContent: whose true value lies inside of the specification limits is considered a Type I error with error rate (probability) $\\alpha$ . R3-1.2 The event of accepting an item whose true value lies outside of the specification limits is considered a Type II error with error rate (probability) $\\beta .$ R3-1.3 One of the difficulties in formulating the statistical model is that there are two or more distributions involved, possibly in an interdependent fashion. Given a true underlying (fixed) value, $x ,$ a single measurement of that value produces the observation $Y = x + U ,$ where $U$ is a random and unobservable value attributable to measurement variability. If one takes $n$ measurements of the same value $x .$ , i.e., $Y _ { i } = x + U _ { i } ,$ where $i = I , . . . , n$ , $Y$ and $U$ are treated as random variables from the observation and measurement variability distributions, respectively. The situation is further complicated if several $x$\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 BACKGROUND OF THE METHODOLOGY (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 BACKGROUND OF THE METHODOLOGY\n\nContent: values are measured. In this situation, the $x$ values come from the process (or characteristic) distribution $X$ such that $Y _ { i j } = X _ { j } + U _ { i j } ,$ where $i = I , . . . , n$ and $j = I , . . . , m$ . The relationship between $X$ and $U$ is known as a convolution. Additional distributions may be involved if one assumes that certain characteristics of the measurement process do not remain constant over the measurement range. For example, one may assume that bias is a function of the measured value. To model this a third distribution would be needed, but the scope of this practice is limited to the use of only two distributions (characteristic and measurement variability).

It was derived from task force deliberations during the development of the document. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on September 3, 2003. R4-1 This example relates to the calculation of the cost components due to misclassification caused by measurement variability in flatness measurement during wafer manufacturing. The following premises are made: R4-1.1 A wafer manufacturer must supply a customer with a specific number of wafers that conform to a site flatness specification of $0 . 1 3 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , SFQR as defined in SEMI M1. R4-1.2 Most wafers produced do conform to the specification. Due to variability in the manufacturing process, some wafers do not conform to the specification. R4-1.3 The flatness measurement step is near the end of the wafer manufacturing process. It follows surface\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE\n\nContent: polishing and precedes final cleaning, surface inspection, and packaging. R4-1.4 All of the wafers are measured for site flatness. The measurement data is used to determine if wafers are passed for further processing and shipment or if they are failed and scrapped without further processing. This example premises no rework for failed wafers. R4-1.5 The customer is always able to detect a nonconforming wafer. When a non-conforming wafer is detected, it is returned to the manufacturer and a replacement wafer must be supplied to satisfy the specified order quantity. R4-2 The following steps follow the procedures outlined in Section 6. R4-2.1 Estimation of Process Distribution — A total of 17,698 observations was made on flatness measurements. An empirical estimate of the flatness CDF was calculated from these data and is shown in the column of Table R4-1 labeled $F ( x )$ . R4.2.2 Estimation of Bias and Variance for Each Gauge\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE\n\nContent: Compared — Two gauges are available. Gauge A has zero bias and a measurement variability of $\\sigma _ { A } = 0 . 0 0 4 3 3$ , which results in a $\\mathbf { P } / \\mathrm { T }$ ratio of $10 \\%$ , calculated in accordance with SEMI M27 for a single sided distribution. Gauge B also has zero bias, but has a measurement variability of $\\sigma _ { B } = 0 . 0 0 8 6 7$ or a $\\mathbf { P / T }$ ratio of $20 \\%$ . Let the distribution of the measurement variability for the two gauges be normally distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviations given above. R4-2.3 Calculation of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ — To calculate $\\alpha$ and $\\beta ,$ one needs to estimate $f ( x )$ and $\\Phi ( z )$ , where $$ z = ( U S L - x ) / \\sigma _ { _ { M } } . $$ The values in the column labeled $f ( x )$ are derived by dividing the value in the count column by the total number of observations. $\\sigma ( z )$ is calculated from the normal CDF using the\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE\n\nContent: numbers in the first column as $x$ , 0.13 as the USL, and either $\\sigma _ { A } = 0 . 0 0 4 3 3$ or $\\sigma _ { B } = 0 . 0 0 8 6 7$ for $\\sigma _ { M } ,$ depending on whether Gauge A or Gauge B is used. To calculate $\\alpha _ { \\ast }$ , for each row multiply $f ( x )$ by $1 - \\Phi ( z )$ and sum over all rows at or below the specification limit. To calculate $\\beta$ , for each row multiply $f ( x )$ by $\\Phi ( z )$ and sum over all rows above the USL. The calculations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for the two $\\mathbf { P / T }$ ratios of $10 \\%$ and $20 \\%$ can also be found in Table R4-1. R4-2.4 Decision Model — One of four situations may occur depending on the true flatness of the wafer, conforming or nonconforming, and the decision made based on the output from the metrology equipment, pass or fail. Two correspond to correct actions: passing a conforming item and failing a nonconforming item. Zero incremental cost is\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE\n\nContent: associated with correct classification. The two situations associated with misclassification, passing a nonconforming item and failing a conforming item, have actual incremental costs. R4-2.5 Estimation of Costs — For purposes of illustration, let the cost of failing a conforming wafer $\\displaystyle \\left( c _ { f c } \\right)$ be $\\$ 300$ and the cost of passing a nonconforming $( c _ { p n } )$ wafer be $\\$ 220$ . The cost of ownership due to measurement variability and bias can then be calculated as: $$ \\begin{array} { r } { \\mathrm { ~ \\ o s t ~ } = c _ { f c } P ( \\mathrm { f a i l , c o n f o r m i n g } ) + c _ { p n } P ( \\mathrm { p a s s , n o n c o n f o r m i n g } ) } \\\\ { = c _ { f c } \\alpha + c _ { p n } \\beta } \\end{array} $$ R4-2.6 Calculation of Costs — The cost components due to measurement variability for Gauge A and Gauge B are: $$ { \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\operatorname { c o s t } _ { \\mathbf { A } } \\ =\n\nSEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI M56-1103 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINING COST COMPONENTS FOR METROLOGY EQUIPMENT DUE TO MEASUREMENT VARIABILITY AND BIAS - # RELATED INFORMATION 4EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE\n\nContent: c _ { f c } \\alpha _ { A } + c _ { p n } \\beta _ { A } } \\\\ & { \\ = } \\\\ & { ( 3 0 0 ) ( 0 . 0 1 0 4 2 5 3 0 ) + ( 2 2 0 ) ( 0 . 0 0 0 1 1 6 9 8 ) = 3 . 1 5 3 3 } \\\\ & { \\operatorname { c o s t } _ { \\mathbf { B } } \\ = c _ { f c } \\alpha _ { B } + c _ { p n } \\beta _ { B } } \\\\ & { \\ = } \\\\ & { ( 3 0 0 ) ( 0 . 0 1 4 2 8 0 5 5 ) + ( 2 2 0 ) ( 0 . 0 0 1 4 5 9 5 0 ) = 4 . 6 0 5 3 } \\end{array} } $$ The cost difference in operating Gauge A rather than Gauge B in this example is, on average, $\\$ 1.45$ per wafer.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on April 22, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org May 2004; to be published July 2004.\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 1 Purpose\n\n1.1 SEMI M52 requires the use of certified reference materials (CRMs) for calibration of scanning surface inspection systems (SSISs). The calibration method is defined in SEMI M53.  This test method provides the procedure to determine whether a specific particle deposition system, using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA), can produce the required CRMs.  \n1.2 Both organizations producing depositions internally for in-house use and companies manufacturing depositions for sale can apply this test method to ensure that their particle deposition systems provide depositions that meet the requirements of SEMI M52.\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 2 Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method covers determination of the deposition peak diameter and the associated expanded relative combined peak diameter uncertainty produced by a particle deposition system and its associated deposition procedures for comparison to the $3 \\%$ requirement of SEMI M52. 2.2 This test method also covers determination of the ability of the deposition system to produce depositions with diameter distributions that are less than $5 \\%$ full width at half maximum (FWHM) as required by SEMI M52 even when using a particle source with a much wider distribution. 2.3 These tests require that the deposition system employ a DMA (or an equivalent programmable filtering system) to accomplish both peak diameter determination and narrowing of particle source distributions (see Related Information 1). 2.4 This test method covers determination of repeatability over a period of one week. Tests can be repeated periodically to determine long term stability. Long term stability of most DMA-based particle deposition systems\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 2 Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: is believed to be on the order of a year or more, but it is recommended that the tests be repeated on an annual basis or whenever the instrument appears to be out of control. 2.5 This test method requires the use of three different kinds of particle distributions with specified characteristics and wafers that have surface characteristics adequate to allow detection of the smallest particles utilized with a capture rate of greater than $9 5 \\%$ .

At the time when this test method was developed, only one such standard existed. Therefore if the bias contribution to uncertainty is a function of the peak diameter in the suspension, the determination may be in error at peak diameters away from that of the known standard. 3.3 There is the possibility that the deposited particle diameter may differ slightly from the certified value for the bottle containing\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 3 Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 3 Limitations\n\nContent: the suspension because the surfactant in the suspension and contaminants in the water may cause an increase in particle size. This limitation can be avoided by using DMAs with the same spray system, the same purity of dilution water, and the same suspension concentration both to size the particles in the bottle and make the deposition. This possibility may be minimized by using PSL suspension fluids with low non-volatile content to reduce the possibility of non-volatile materials drying onto the particles in the suspension.\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 4.1 SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI M50 — Test Method for Determining Capture Rate for Surface Scanning Inspection Systems by the Overlay Method  \nSEMI M52 — Guide for Specifying Scanning Surface Inspection Systems for Silicon Wafers for the $1 3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ Technology Generation  \nSEMI M53 — Practice for Calibrating Scanning Surface Inspection Systems using Depositions of Monodisperse Polystyrene Latex Sphere on Unpatterned Semiconductor Wafer Surfaces  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology 4.2 ISO Standard  \nISO 14644-1 Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments — Part 1:  Classification of airborne particulates  \nNOTICE: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be the latest publications of adopted standards.\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 5 Terminology\n\n5.1 Definitions for terms related to surface scanning inspection systems are found in SEMI M50, SEMI M52, and SEMI M53.  \n5.2 Additional terminology related to silicon wafer technology is defined in SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 6 Summary of Method (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # 6 Summary of Method\n\nContent: 6.1 Three bottles (A, B and C) of PSL sphere suspensions meeting specific requirements are obtained. Bottle A is a CRM with a certified peak diameter and a very narrow diameter distribution so that no matter how the deposition system functions, the deposition will meet the requirements of SEMI M52.

R1-1 Deposition systems include a nebulizer for producing a PSL sphere aerosol by spraying and evaporating a suspension of PSL spheres in high purity water, a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) for selecting a monodisperse fraction of the aerosol, and then a chamber to electrostatically deposit the spheres onto wafers. Here we focus on the DMA, which is used for both isolating a monodisperse size fraction and for sizing the particles.

As illustrated in Figure R1-1, the DMA consists of an inner cylindrical rod connected to a variable high voltage dc power supply and an outer annular tube connected to ground. Clean sheath air flows through the axial region, while the charged aerosol enters through an axisymmetric opening along the outer cylinder. The positively charged PSL spheres move radially towards the center rod under the influence of the electric field. Near the bottom of the classifying region, a fraction of the air flow consisting of near-monodisperse aerosol exits through a slit in the center rod.

The transfer function is of great importance, because the size distribution of the aerosol exiting the DMA is proportional to the convolution of the transfer function with the particle size distribution function. The transfer function has a triangular shape with a peak value of 1. The ratio of the base of the transfer function triangle in terms of voltage divided by the peak voltage is predicted to be $2 ( Q _ { s } / Q c )$ , where $Q _ { s }$ is the flow of monodisperse aerosol. R1-4 This ratio is also equal to the ratio of the full width of the mobility distribution to the peak value. For a flow ratio of 1 to 20, one finds that the full width at half maximum of the peak mobility (FWHM) is equal to $5 \\%$ of the peak mobility.

Because the slip correction is a function of the diameter, an iterative process is used. In cases where samples have a broad size distribution, a correction factor is used that is based on the instrument convolution integral and involves the product of the transfer function times, the charging probability, and the size distribution (see Related Information 1 of SEMI M53 for a further discussion of the effect of the transfer function).\n\nSEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # RELATED INFORMATION 2 EXAMPLE OF A COMPLETED DATA AND ANALYSIS SHEET (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M58-0704 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING DMA BASED PARTICLE DEPOSITION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES - # RELATED INFORMATION 2 EXAMPLE OF A COMPLETED DATA AND ANALYSIS SHEET\n\nContent: NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI M58 and was derived from information developed during drafting of the standard.

Most variant of all crystal properties, conductivity can range over 13 orders of magnitude. Conductivity can be locally modified by temperature, carrier injection, irradiation, or magnetic field. 5.15 conductivity type — a property that identifies the majority charge carrier in the semiconductor; see also $n$ -type, $p$ -type. 5.16 contaminant, particulate — see localized light scatterer. 5.17 contamination, area — matter, unintentionally added to the surface of a wafer, of extent greater than a single localized light scatterer. 5.17.1 Discussion — Area contamination, a type of extended light scatterer, may be foreign matter on the wafe surface resulting from chuck marks, finger or glove prints, stains, wax or solvent residues, etc. 5.18 contamination, particulate — a particle or\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: particles on the surface of a wafer, see localized light scatterer. 5.19 crack — cleavage or fracture that extends to the surface of a wafer. 5.20 crater — surface feature with irregular closed ridges and smooth central regions. 5.21 Crow’s foot — intersecting cracks in a pattern resembling a “crow's foot” (Y) on (111) surfaces and a cross $( + )$ on (100) surfaces. 5.22 crystal defect — departure from the ideal arrangement of atoms in a crystal. 5.23 crystal indices — see Miller indices. 5.24 crystal originated pit, COP — a small pit or plurality of small pits introduced during crystal growth that act as an LLS when they intersect the surface of a wafer. 5.24.1 Discussion — Because they act in some ways similarly to particles when viewed with an SSIS, this defect was originally called a crystal originated particle. Modern SSISs can, however, generally distinguish COPs from particles. Surface cleaning or light etching frequently increases the size and number of COPs observed, when they are present. 5.25 crystallographic notation — a symbolism based\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: on Miller indices used to label planes and directions in a crystal as follows: plane (111) family of planes {111} direction [111] family of directions ${ < } 1 1 1 { > }$ 5.26 denuded zone — a volume in a wafer, usually located just under the front surface, in which the oxygen content has been lowered so that the bulk microdefect (oxide precipitate) density is reduced. 5.27 diameter, of a semiconductor wafer — the linear dimension across the surface of a circular wafer that contains the wafer center and excludes flats or other peripheral fiduciary geometries. 5.28 dimple — a shallow depression with gently sloping sides that exhibits a concave, spheroidal shape and is visible to the unaided eye under proper lighting conditions. 5.29 dislocation etch pit — a pit generated by a preferential etch where a dislocation meets the surface of a wafer. 5.30 donor — an impurity or imperfection in a semiconductor that donates electrons to the conduction band, leading to electron conduction. 5.31 dopant — a chemical element, usually from the third or fifth\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: columns of the periodic table, incorporated in trace amounts in a silicon crystal to establish its conductivity type and resistivity. 5.32 dopant striation rings — helical features on the surface of a silicon wafer associated with local variations in impurity concentration. 5.33 doping, v. — addition of specific impurities to a semiconductor to control the electrical resistivity. 5.34 edge exclusion, nominal, EE — the distance from the FQA boundary to the periphery of a wafer of nominal dimensions. 5.35 edge profile — on edge contoured wafers (whose edges have been shaped chemically or mechanically), a description of the contour of the boundary of the wafer that joins the front and back surfaces. 5.36 etch — a solution, a mixture of solutions, or a mixture of gases that attacks the surfaces of a film or substrate, removing material either selectively or nonselectively. 5.37 etch pit — a pit, resulting from preferential etching, localized on the surface of a wafer at a crystal defect or stressed region. 5.38 extended light scatterer (XLS) — a feature\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: larger than the spatial resolution of the inspection equipment, on or in a wafer surface, resulting in increased light scattering intensity relative to that of the surrounding wafer surface. 5.38.1 Discussion — Origins of XLSs include area contamination and unresolved clusters of localized light scatterers, such as particles or COPs. When oberved by the unaided eye, an XLS can usually be seen under high intensity illumination. Some SSISs have sensors for reporting XLSs. XLSs can be observed as increased haze under dark field conditions. Under bright field conditions, an XLS can be observed as a decrease in the intensity of the specularly reflected beam, sometimes called a light channel defect. 5.39 extrinsic, adj. — (1) the region in the conductivity-temperature curve where the conduction in a wafer is dominated by holes or electrons from dopant atoms; (2) a process, such as extrinsic gettering, caused by factors outside the crystal of the wafer itself. 5.40 fiducial — a flat or a notch on a wafer intended to provide a location referenced to its\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: crystallographic axes. 5.41 fixed quality area, FQA — the central area of a wafer surface, defined by a nominal edge exclusion, $E E$ , ove which the specified values of a parameter apply. 5.41.1 Discussion — The boundary of the FQA is at all points the distance $E E$ away from the periphery of a wafer of nominal dimensions. The size of the FQA is independent of wafer diameter and flat length tolerances. For the purposes of defining the FQA, the periphery of a wafer of nominal dimensions at a location with a notch is assumed to follow the circumference of a circle with diameter equal to the nominal wafer diameter. It may be necessary to specify exclusion areas where the values of a specified parameter do not apply for regions like: the notch, laser marks, or where handling/gripping devices contact the wafer. 5.42 flat — a portion of the periphery of a circular wafer that has been removed to a chord; see also primary flat, secondary flat. 5.43 flat diameter — the linear dimension across the surface of a semiconductor wafer from the center of the flat\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: through the wafer center to the circumference of the wafer on the opposite edge along the diameter perpendicular to the flat. 5.43.1 Discussion — The flat diameter is most often associated with the primary flat. In the case of opposing primary and secondary flats, as occurs on $\\{ 1 0 0 \\}$ $n$ -type wafers $1 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and smaller in diameter, the concept of flat diameter does not apply because the diameter perpendicular to the flats does not intersect the wafer circumference. 5.44 flatness — for wafer surfaces, the deviation of the front surface, expressed in TIR or maximum FPD relative to a specified reference plane when the back surface of the wafer is ideally flat, as when pulled down by a vacuum onto an ideally clean flat chuck. 5.44.1 Discussion — The flatness of a wafer may be described as either: the global flatness, the maximum value of site flatness as measured on all sites, or the percentage of sites that have a site flatness equal to or less than a specified value. NOTE 1: See Appendix 1 of SEMI M1 for a complete discussion\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: of flatness parameters. 5.45 focal plane — the plane perpendicular to the optical axis of an imaging system that contains the focal point of the imaging system. 5.45.1 Discussion — The reference plane used by an imaging system is coincident with or parallel with the focal plane. Full field imaging systems employ coincident global focal and reference planes. Partial field imaging systems employ either coincident site focal and reference planes or displaced site focal and global reference planes. If the reference plane is not coincident with the focal plane, it is displaced from the focal plane so that the point on the front surface at a site center lies in the focal plane. 5.46 focal plane deviation, FPD — the distance parallel to the optical axis from a point on the wafer surface to the focal plane. 5.47 four-point probe — an electrical probe arrangement for determining the resistivity of a material in which separate pairs of contacts are used (1) for passing current through the specimen and (2) measuring the potential drop caused by the current.\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: 5.48 front side — not preferred; use front surface. 5.49 front surface — the exposed surface upon which active semiconductor devices have been or will be fabricated. 5.50 gettering — the process that immobilizes impurities at locations away from the region of the specimen to be investigated. 5.51 global flatness — the TIR or the maximum FPD relative to a specified reference plane within the FQA. 5.52 gradient, resistivity — not preferred; use resistivity variation. 5.53 groove — a shallow scratch with rounded edges that is usually the remnant of a scratch not completely removed by polishing. 5.54 haze — non-localized light-scattering resulting from surface topography (microroughness) or from dense concentrations of surface or near-surface imperfections; see also laser light-scattering event. 5.54.1 Discussion — Haze due to the existence of a collection of imperfections is a mass effect; individual imperfections of the type that result in haze cannot be readily distinguished by the eye or other optical detection system without magnification.

Contoured wafer edges may also exhibit lay even after polishing. 5.61 light point defect, LPD — not preferred, use localized light-scatterer, LLS. 5.61.1 Discussion — To some, the term light point defect implies a defective part; hence, a search was undertaken for a more neutral term. Several were tried, and finally, despite some objection to the difficulty of\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 14)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: saying the code, the term localized light scatterer was approved as a replacement. This term is general in nature and can refer to features detected both visual inspection and by automated inspection using a scanning surface inspection system. 5.62 lineage — a low-angle grain boundary resulting from an array of dislocations. 5.63 localized light-scatterer, LLS — an isolated feature, such as a particle or a pit, on or in a wafer surface, resulting in increased light-scattering intensity relative to that of the surrounding wafer surface; sometimes called light point defect. 5.63.1 Discussion — Localized light scatterers of sufficient size appear as points of light under high intensity optical illumination; these points of light can be observed visually, but the observation is a qualitative one. Localized light scatterers are observed by automated inspection techniques as laser-light scattering events. Automated inspection techniques are quantitative in the sense that scatterers with different scattering intensities can be segregated.

Particles are observed by automated inspection as laser light-scattering events, but they may also be observed visually under high intensity illumination as points of light or studied by other methods, including scanning electron microscopy. Particles on wafer surfaces can usually be removed by non-etching cleaning. 5.79 pit — a depression in a wafer surface where sloped sides of the depression meet the surface in a distinguishable manner in contrast to the sides of a dimple, which are rounded. 5.80 point defect — a localized crystal defect such as a lattice vacancy, interstitial atom, or substitutional impurity Contrast with light point defect. 5.81 preferential etch — a selective etch that etches regions of different crystal strain or conductivity at different rates, used to delineate crystal defects or regions of\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 19)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: differing conductivity on wafer surfaces. 5.82 primary flat — the flat of longest length on the wafer, oriented such that the chord is parallel with a specified low index crystal plane; sometimes called major flat. 5.83 radial gradient — not preferred; use resistivity variation. 5.84 reference plane — a plane defined by one of the following: three points at specified locations on the front or back surface of the wafer, the least squares fit to the front or median surface of the wafer using all points within the FQA, the least squares fit to the front surface of the wafer using all points within a site, or an ideal back surface (equivalent to the ideally flat chuck surface that contacts the wafer). 5.84.1 Discussion — For flatness measurement, the specified reference plane is chosen with due regard for the capabilities of the imaging system. Front surface or back surface reference planes should be selected depending on the wafer mounting system. If the wafer cannot be gimbaled in the imaging system, a back surface reference plane should be specified.\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 20)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: For shape measurement, the reference plane to be used is spelled out in the applicable test method. 5.85 reference plane deviation, RPD — the distance perpendicular to the reference plane between the reference plane and the wafer surface being measured. 5.86 resistivity, (electrical), $\\sigma ,$ $\\scriptstyle \\left[ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m } \\right]$ — the measure of difficulty with which charged carriers flow through a material; the reciprocal of conductivity. 5.86.1 Discussion — the resistivity of a semiconductor or other material is the ratio of the potential gradient (electric field) parallel with the current to the current density. 5.87 rms area microroughness, $R _ { q A }$ — the root mean square of the topographic deviations of a surface $Z ( x , y )$ from the mean surface taken within the (rectangular) evaluation area $A _ { e } = L _ { x } L _ { y }$ . 5.87.1 Discussion — The rms area microroughness is one of several statistical metrics that can be used to describe surface topography; definitions for other metrics and for such concepts\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 21)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: as mean surface and evaluation area may be found in ANSI/ASME B46.1 and ISO $4 2 8 7 / 1$ . 5.87.2 The function $R _ { q A }$ is related to a two-dimensional measurement of the surface profile as follows: $$ R _ { q A } = \\left[ \\frac { 1 } { A _ { e } } \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { L _ { x } } \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { L } \\left( x , y \\right) ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { d } x \\mathrm { d } y \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ The digital approximation of $R _ { q A }$ for a surface profile consisting of $N$ by $M$ data points equally spaced along the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, is: $$ R _ { _ { q A } } = \\left[ \\frac { 1 } { N M } \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { M } \\sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { N } Z _ { i j } ^ { 2 } \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ 5.87.3 Experimentally, the profile is always limited by the spatial bandwidth of the measurement.

Similarly, in the $y$ direction, the profile length is $L _ { y }$ divided into $M$ equally spaced points; the lower frequency limit for $f _ { y }$ can never be less than $1 / L _ { \\mathrm { y } }$ and the upper spatial frequency limit can never be greater than the Nyquist limit, $M / 2 L _ { \\mathrm { y } }$ . Practical limits to the spatial bandwidth are governed by considerations similar to those for the one-dimensional case (see $9 5 . 8 8 . 4 )$ . $5 . 8 7 . 4 R _ { q A }$ can also be estimated by integrating the two-dimensional power spectral density (PSD) function, $P S D ( f _ { x } ,$ $f _ { y } )$ , over the spatial frequency range between spatial frequencies that lie within the bandwidth of the measurement: $$ R _ { q A } = \\left[ \\int \\displaylimits _ { f _ { x _ { 1 } } } ^ { f _ { x _ { 2 } } f _ { y _ { 2 } } } \\int P S D _ { A } ( f _ { x } , f _ { y } ) \\mathrm { d } f _ { x } \\mathrm { d } f _ { y } \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ 5.87.5 If the surface is assumed to be isotropic and the instrument response\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 23)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: function is neglected, the rms microroughness over the spatial frequency range between $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ can also be obtained by integrating the isotropic PSD function: $$ R _ { q A } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { f _ { 2 } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle { \\int P S D _ { i s o } ( f ) \\mathrm { d } f } } \\\\ { f _ { 1 } } \\end{array} \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ where: $$ P S D _ { i s o } ( f ) = \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { 2 \\pi } P S D _ { A } ( f _ { x } , f _ { y } ) f \\mathrm { d } \\beta $$ $$ f = ( f _ { x } ^ { 2 } + f _ { y } ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ 5.88 rms microroughness, $R _ { q }$ — the root mean square of the surface profile height deviations $Z ( x )$ from the mean line taken within the evaluation length $L$ . 5.88.1 Discussion — $R _ { q }$ is one of several statistical metrics that can be used to describe a surface profile; definitions for other metrics and for such concepts as mean line, evaluation length, and power spectral density function, may be found in ANSI/ASME B46.1 and ISO 4287/1. 5.88.2 The function $R _ { q }$ is related to a\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 24)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: one-dimensional measurement of the surface profile as follows: $$ R _ { q } = \\left[ \\frac { 1 } { L } \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { L } \\left( x \\right) ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { d } x \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ 5.88.3 The digital approximation of $R _ { q }$ for a profile consisting of $N$ equally spaced points is: $$ R _ { q } = \\left[ \\frac { 1 } { N } { \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } } Z _ { i } ^ { 2 } \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ 5.88.4 Experimentally, the profile is always limited by the spatial bandwidth of the measurement. For a profile of length $L$ , consisting of $N$ equally spaced points, the lower spatial frequency limit $f _ { 1 }$ can never be less than $1 / L$ and the upper spatial frequency limit $f _ { 2 }$ can never be greater than the Nyquist limit, $N / 2 L$ . In practical cases, $f _ { 1 } \\approx 2 / L$ ; the achievable value of $f _ { 2 }$ depends on instrumental parameters. $5 . 8 8 . 5 R _ { q }$ can also be estimated by integrating the one-dimensional power spectral density (PSD) function, $P S D ( f )$ , over the spatial frequency range between two\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 25)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: spatial frequencies, $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ , that lie within the bandwidth of the measurement: $$ R _ { q } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { l } { f _ { 2 } } \\\\ { \\int P S D ( f ) \\mathrm { d } f } \\\\ { f _ { 1 } } \\end{array} \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } $$ 5.88.6 In all cases, $R _ { q }$ must be reported together with the lower and upper limits, $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ , respectively, of the spatial frequency bandwidth over which it has been determined. Alternatively, the spatial bandwidth may be expressed in terms of the upper and lower spatial wavelengths, $\\lambda _ { 2 } ~ ( = 1 / f _ { 2 } )$ and $\\lambda _ { 1 } ( = 1 / f _ { 1 } )$ , respectively. 5.89 roughness — the more narrowly spaced components of surface texture. 5.89.1 Discussion —These components are considered within defined limits of spatial wavelength (or frequency). .90 scan direction — the direction of successive subsites in a scanner site flatness calculation. 5.90.1 Discussion — The scanner site flatness value obtained for a site may depend on scan direction. 5.91 scanner site\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 26)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: flatness — the maximum subsite TIR or the maximum subsite FPD, of a site. 5.91.1 Discussion — The subsite TIR is the TIR of the portion of the subsite that falls within the FQA and within the site; the subsite FPD is the maximum FPD of the portion of the subsite that falls within the FQA and within the site. The reference plane is calculated using all points within the subsite that fall within the FQA. 5.91.2 Precise scanner site flatness measurement requires measurement points located closely enough to reveal the surface topography in detail.

It is recommended that site flatness be measured using a data point array with adjacent points separated by $2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ or less. It is also recommended that the data set used to calculate site flatness have data at each site corner and along each site boundary. This makes the effective site measurement area equal to the site size. 5.99 slip — a process of plastic deformation in which one part of a crystal undergoes a shear displacement relative to another in a fashion that preserves the crystallinity of the material. 5.99.1 Discussion — After preferential etching, slip lines are evidenced by a pattern of one or more parallel straight lines of dislocation etch pits that do not necessarily touch each other.

Not included in this category are non-removable artifacts not caused by contaminants; such artifacts are frequently localized differences in surface texture. 5.102 subsite, of a site — a rectangular area, $\\mathrm { L } _ { \\mathrm { s s } } \\times \\mathrm { W } _ { \\mathrm { s s } } ,$ , on the front surface of a wafer, associated with a particular site. The center of the subsite must be within the site. Some part of the subsite must be within or on the FQA boundary. A subsite corresponds to the instantaneous area exposed by a scanning stepper. 5.103 surface texture — the topographic deviations of a real surface from a reference surface. 5.103.1 Discussion — Surface texture includes\n\nSEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 30)\n\nTitle: SEMI M59-0305 TERMINOLOGY FOR SILICON TECHNOLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: roughness, waviness, and lay. 5.104 swirl — helical or concentric features that are visible to the unaided eye after preferential etch, and appear to be discontinuous under $1 0 0 \\times$ magnification. 5.105 terracing — a network of contours that are associated with pyramid-like defects on epitaxially deposited surfaces and are related to the orientation of the surface. 5.106 thermal emf — the net emf set up in a thermocouple under conditions of zero current.

Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on January 11, 2005.  Initially available at www.semi.org January 2005; to be published March 2005.\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The technique outlined in this test method is for the purpose of standardizing silicon wafer characterization by GOI (Gate Oxide Integrity).  For more detailed discussion of the general characterizing methods for this test, the reader is referred to $\\ S 3$ .  TZDB technique as SEMI M51 is advantageous to estimate failure rate by intrinsic breakdown as the C mode and an accidental breakdown as the B mode.  However, this test method has a higher sensitivity for detecting the accidental breakdown mode than TZDB.\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method is for the purpose of the characterization method of silicon wafer by GOI. This characterization method is outlined below 2.1.1 MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) — capacitor fabrication — A gate oxide film is thermally grown on a silicon wafer surface. Then, poly-Si electrodes are formed on the gate oxide film. Other metals, other than polysilicon electrode materials, can be used, however, it shall be desirable to use an electrode that has been confirmed to have sufficiently good characteristics for application as a gate electrode as described below. 2.1.2 Electrical Characterization Evaluation — The TDDB (Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown) characteristics of the MOS capacitors are measured. The presence of COPs (Crystal Originated Particles) at the surface of the polished Si substrates influences the TDDB characteristics of the gate oxide. That is, the silicon wafer is evaluated in terms of the TDDB characteristics of the gate oxide. The test method outlined in\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: this test method is for the purpose of standardizing the procedure of MOS fabrication, measurement, analyses, and the report of the GOI data to interested parties. This test method is based on the results of round robin among the silicon wafer manufacturers. In general, GOI strongly depends on crystal defects, contaminations and particles on/near wafer surface. GOI also depends on the fabrication environment. The cleanliness of the process environment in which the MOS capacitors are fabricated shall be evaluated to be acceptable (see $\\ P 5 . 3 )$ . 2.2 The target of this test method is to characterize silicon wafers, that is, evaluate COPs near the silicon wafer surface. The proper gate oxide thickness of the MOS samples is $2 0 { - } 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . A discussion on gate oxide thickness is given in a later section. Oxygen precipitates are also one of the gate oxide defect origins, however, this is beyond the scope of this test method because the as-received wafers contain\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: only a small amount of oxygen precipitates. Near-surface quality can be evaluated in this test. In this case, it is assumed that an oxide film thickness of approximately $1 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ is used. It is more difficult to categorize the accidental and intrinsic breakdowns in TZDB, as the gate oxide thickness becomes thinner. Therefore mode classification in TDDB is more effective. 2.3 For detailed discussion on sample structures used in this test method, the reader shall refer to EIA/JEDEC Standard 35-1. In general, the most likely sample structures are a simple planar MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) capacitor structure, various isolation structures (for example, LOCOS (LOCal Oxidation of Silicon), STI (Shallow Trench Isolation)), and FET (Field-Effect Transistor) structures. For the purpose of silicon wafer characterization, the simple planar MOS capacitor structure is the most desirable. In the case of the various isolation and FET structures, the silicon wafer receives thermal\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: treatments several times in the complicated sample fabrication process. Therefore, in this case it is questionable whether the characteristics of the starting Si wafer are reflected in this test measurement results. 2.4 In this evaluation method, a constant current stress is applied to the gate oxide and time to breakdown is measured. The amount of charge injected until dielectric breakdown $( \\mathrm { Q } _ { \\mathrm { b d } } )$ is also calculated. (Constant-current TDDB: detail of measurement condition is described in a later section). The dielectric breakdown by the COPs and other defects can be evaluated from the accumulated failure distribution of $\\mathrm { Q _ { b d } }$ . In addition, a constant-voltage TDDB method can be used as an evaluation of gate oxide lifetime. In this test method, the constant-current TDDB method is chosen, because the constant current TDDB method has less influence on parasitic resistance in a measurement circuit than the constant-voltage TDDB method.\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.5 This test method gives instructions for the procedure for characterizing mirror-polished, p-type CZ silicon wafers. Gate electrodes were negatively biased so that the silicon surface is in accumulation. Stress current shall be sufficient for the gate oxide to be broken down within a finite measurement time. In addition, it is desirable to have an applied current density J within 0.01 and $0 . 1 \\mathrm { A } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ . 2.6 The stress gate current has to be reversed for the n-type silicon wafer. 2.7 The poly-silicon film is used as gate electrode of measured MOS capacitors. The poly-silicon film can make standard test results applicable to the testing of wafers used to fabricate integrated circuits rather than other metal electrodes because poly-silicon electrodes are commonly used in actual devices. However, a gate electrode other than poly-silicon gate electrode shall be studied for applications in advanced ultralarge-scale integrated circuits. In this case, the\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: new electrode material shall have the same detection sensitivity to silicon wafer defects as poly-silicon electrode.

This was found as particles appeared on the silicon surface by repetition ${ \\mathrm { S C } } - 1 ^ { 5 }$ of RCA cleaning. 4.2.3.1.1 Discussion — It has been thought that the COP is one of the main origins of the GOI. The gate oxide formed on the Si surface at which the COP appears easily breaks down at the corner of the octahedral shape like at a Si trench corner6,7,8. This\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: corner of octahedral structures is thinning the oxide films. The oxide electric field enhances at that place. The breakdown electric field is decreased. 4.2.3.2 Failure Modes — The TDDB Weibull plot9, 10 is classified to three modes. A typical plot is shown in Figure 1. 4.2.3.2.1 Discussion on failure modes: • A-A Mode: Initial breakdown failure o This failure is caused by defects generated during gate oxide formation process such as pinholes and also by crystal defects such as COPs. This failure corresponds to the A mode and partly B mode failures of TZDB. A-B Mode: Intermediate breakdown failure o This failure is caused by extrinsic defects which are not serious enough to cause the A-A mode. This failure corresponds to the B mode and partly C mode failure of TZDB. W Mode: Wearout breakdown o This breakdown is also called intrinsic breakdown or fatigue breakdown, and relates to the intrinsic lifetime of oxide films. The measurement of this breakdown shall be performed carefully\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4  Terminology (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: because the result depends on measurement conditions. o Response rapidity of the measurement system has a great influence on A-A mode detection. The total number of A-A and A-B mode failures is related to the crystal quality of the mirror-polished CZ Si wafers. 4.2.3.3 Categorization of Breakdown Modes — boundaries of A-A/A-B modes and A-B/W modes shall be defined in advance.\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4.2.3.3.1  A-A/A-B Mode Boundary\n\n• The detectable minimum $\\mathrm { Q } _ { \\mathrm { b d } }$ values depend on the stress current and response speed of the measurement systems.  As stress current density increases, the charge density of the A-A/A-B mode boundary may also increases.  This effect shall be considered when defining the A-A/A-B mode boundary.  Based on these round robin results, the charge density range from $0 . 0 0 0 1 \\mathrm { C } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { \\overline { { 2 } } }$ to $0 . 0 1 ~ \\mathrm { C } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ is recommended as the A-A/A-B mode boundary.\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4.2.3.3.2  A-B/W mode boundary (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4.2.3.3.2  A-B/W mode boundary\n\nContent: The A-B/W mode boundary is defined in terms of Weibull plots as shown in Figure RI-3. Ideally, it shall be determined by the intercept point of two approximation lines in the A-B and W mode ranges. If the boundary charge density is too low $\\scriptstyle ( \\mathrm { Q } ^ { \\prime } < 1 \\mathrm { C } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } )$ , one part of the A-B mode breakdown can be counted as the W mode. Otherwise, if the boundary charge density is too high $\\mathrm { ( Q > 4 C / c m ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { ) }$ , one part of the W mode breakdown can be counted as the A-B mode. • In both cases, we have errors in the classification of the failure mode categories, even if the measurement is accurately carried out and appropriate Weibull plots are obtained. So, the results of this round robin indicate that the charge density of $2 \\dot { \\mathrm { C } } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ is recommended as the A-B/W mode boundary. To measure the failure rates at the boundary charge density\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4.2.3.3.2  A-B/W mode boundary (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 4.2.3.3.2  A-B/W mode boundary\n\nContent: of the A-B/W modes, all samples are not necessarily broken down. If the determination procedure of the boundary charge density is clear, the application of a predetermined charge density will give us the approximate failure rate by the A-B mode breakdown. It is necessary to determine the classification of failure modes in advance. This is because reliabilities depend on the devices fabricated on the Si wafer (electrode material, gate oxide thickness, operating voltage, etc.). Refer to an example of mode classification described in Figure RI-2. .2.3.4 Time Zero Dielectric Breakdown (TZDB) — one of the dielectric breakdown characteristic of the gate oxide. 4.2.3.4.1 Discussion — To measure TZDB, oxide leakage current is monitored with an electric field applied to the MOS capacitor stepwise from 0 to $1 5 \\mathrm { M V / c m }$ (for example in the case of a $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ -thick oxide, actual applied voltage would be from 0 to 37.5V).

Applied electric field (or voltage) is measured when the oxide leakage current reaches a predetermined value (judgment current), in other words when the gate oxide breaks down. The influence of COPs on gate oxide breakdown can be estimated from the distribution of breakdown electric field.\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 5  Summary of Method (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 5  Summary of Method\n\nContent: 5.1 Overview — This test method consists of two parts. The first one is the fabrication of a number of similar MOS capacitors on silicon wafers, and the second one is the measurement of the electric charge injected just before the dielectric breakdown of the MOS capacitors. To measure the injected electric charge, the voltage applied to a MOS capacitor is controlled so that the current is kept constant. The voltage is monitored throughout the test, and the time from the beginning to a sudden voltage drop which results from the dielectric breakdown of the silicon dioxide film is measured. The injected electric charge is the product of the measured time and the gate current density. 5.2 MOS Capacitor Fabrication Process — Many MOS capacitors are formed on the test wafer. The MOS fabrication process consists of wafer cleaning, thermal oxidation, poly-Si deposition, phosphorous doping, activation heat treatment, photolithography and etching, in the case of using poly-Si\n\nSEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 5  Summary of Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M60-0305 TEST METHOD FOR TIME DEPENDENT DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SiO2 FILMS FOR Si WAFER EVALUATION - # 5  Summary of Method\n\nContent: electrodes. The details of the MOS capacitor fabrication process are shown in SEMI M51. When materials other than poly-silicon are used for electrodes, the process shall be adjusted to the material used. Although thermally grown $2 0 { - } 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ -thick gate oxide films are recommended in SEMI M51, oxide films as thin as $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ can be used depending on the situation. However, measurement shall be performed carefully for oxide films thinner than $3 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ , because breakdown judgment becomes difficult under the influence of direct tunneling current. See SEMI C3.6, SEMI C3.54, SEMI C21, SEMI C27, SEMI C28, SEMI C30, SEMI C35, SEMI C38, SEMI C41, SEMI C44, SEMI C54, SEMI C59. 5.3 Fabrication Environment — It is necessary to fabricate MOS capacitors in a clean room environment of 1000 or better class in total quality. That is, it needs to be confirmed that the A mode failure rate is $10 \\%$ or less by TZDB evaluation. The A mode",
