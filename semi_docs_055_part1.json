A voltage sag event adversely affecting only one of these pieces of equipment can cause processing equipment to malfunction.  Both the direct and indirect effect of voltage sags on process equipment should be managed. Voltage sags can effect process equipment directly through the electrical power points of connection. Voltage sags can also indirectly effect process equipment through fluctuations in air, gas, liquid, and other utility streams caused when voltage sags effect support equipment and facility infrastructure equipment.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 6.2.1  Process Equipment\n\nEtch (dry & wet)\nFilm deposition (CVD & PVD)\nThermal\nSurface prep and clean\nPhotolithography (exposure & coater/developer)\nChemical Mechanical Polishing\nIon Implant\nMetrology\nAutomated test  \n6.2  Examples of processing equipm ent, support equipment, and facilities infrastructure equipment are\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 6.2.2  Support Equipment\n\nVacuum system (roughing, turbo, and cryogenic\npumps)\nRF generator\nResidual gas analyzer (RGA)\nWater heater\nChiller\nPhotolithography stepper laser light source power\nsupplies\nPhotolithography coat/developer temperature/\nhumidity controllers\nEmission control (burn boxes)\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 6.2.3  Facilities Infrastructure Equip ment\n\nExhaust systems (scrubbers and VOC exhaust fans\nand controls)\nProcess cooling water system (pumps and controls)\nAir compressors (and controls)\nVacuum system (pumps and controls)\nBulk and specialty gas distribution systems (pumps\nand controls)\nLiquid chemical distribution systems (pumps and\ncontrols)\nPower distribution systems\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.1  Reasons for Monitoring and Conditioning (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.1  Reasons for Monitoring and Conditioning\n\nContent: 7.1.1 Semiconductor manufacturing facility electrical distribution systems should be designed to transport power to process equipment, support equipment, and other facilities infrastructure equipment without degradation to the electrical power quality. The system should recognize electrical power that does not meet specification and provide proper power conditioning so as not to impact wafer processing. 7.1.2 Power monitoring is used to measure electrical system power quality performance for the following reasons. a) Monitoring data can be compared to equipment voltage sag specifications to identify problems. b) Selection and control of power conditioning devices are dependent upon monitoring measurements. 7.1.3 Power conditioning is implem ented to correct for gaps in equipment voltage sag susceptibility and point of connection electrical power performance. Power conditioning is occasionally implemented where the risk of unacceptable equipment performance is high, where equipment performance\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.1  Reasons for Monitoring and Conditioning (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.1  Reasons for Monitoring and Conditioning\n\nContent: tolerance is outside specifications, and where equipment interruption is costly.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.2  Monitoring and Conditioning Program\n\n7.2.1  Quantify the process equipmen t, support equipment, and facilities infrastructure equipment voltage sag susceptibility using industry standard specifications and test methods.

Select and implement identified power conditioning solutions into the facilities electrical distribution system.  (See Section 7.7.)  \n7.2.5  Maintain the installed power conditioning equipment and monitor the power either continuously or periodically to assure performance and evaluate results.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.3  Process Equipment Performan ce (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.3  Process Equipment Performan ce\n\nContent: 7.3.1 Facility design specifications s hould include requirements for processing equipment voltage sag immunity (see industry specification for semiconductor processing equipment voltage sag immunity). (See Related Documents section.) 7.3.2 Variability in process equipme nt manufacturing and supplied utility power quality preclude interruption free manufacturing. This variation comes from multiple sources: a) Verification of representative samples of equipment does not guarantee $100 \\%$ of the equipment will meet the same requirements. b) Factors such as location, load changes, capacity, weather, and transmission/ distribution equipment, limit how well utility power quality can be controlled. c) The tests, themselves, are not variation free; the test equipment, calibration processes, and the test personnel can introduce further variability. 7.3.3 The risk of manufacturing inte rruptions can be considerably reduced through two approaches. a) Create a margin between allowable voltage sag for the supplied\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.3  Process Equipment Performan ce (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.3  Process Equipment Performan ce\n\nContent: utility power and process equipment voltage sag immunity. b) Provide added protection from interruptions due to voltage sag events by enhancing the power quality in the facilities distribution system. (This approach is covered in this document, see Scope and the middle segment of Figure 1.)\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.4  Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture Equipment Performance (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.4  Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture Equipment Performance\n\nContent: 7.4.1 The effects that support equipment and facilities infrastructure equipment have on process equipment should be considered. 7.4.2 Process and support equipmen t typically contain flow, temperature, or pressure sensors. If facility infrastructure equipment malfunctions due to a voltage sag event, the diminished flow of a required fluid or gas will cause the support or process equipment to alarm, malfunction, or stop. 7.4.3 A typical interconnection of fa cility infrastructure equipment with process and support equipment is illustrated in Figure 2. The various support and facilities infrastructure systems that can have an indirect effect on process equipment performance when subjected to voltage sag events are listed below: Process cooling water, Scrubbed exhaust, Volatile organic compound (VOC) exhaust, Gas cabinets and gas monitoring system controllers, Compressed dry air, Process vacuum, Automated wafer transport systems, Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM)\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.4  Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture Equipment Performance (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.4  Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture Equipment Performance\n\nContent: systems, Gas leak detection systems, Exhaust abatement systems, and Bulk chemical delivery system. 7.4.4 Since the supplied utility powe r quality effects all the equipment within the factory, performance requirements for support equipment and facilities infrastructure equipment should be specified using the same standards used for processing equipment. Applying the same voltage sag susceptibility specifications for semiconductor processing equipment (see industry specification for semiconductor processing equipment voltage sag immunity) to the support equipment and the facilities infrastructure equipment has the following benefits: (See Related Documents section.) a) Use of the same specification for all equipment allows for consistency when monitoring and conditioning for the effects of voltage sag events. b) The same performance verification test methods as those used for processing equipment can be applied to the support equipment and facilities infrastructure\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.4  Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture Equipment Performance (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.4  Support and Facilities Infrastr ucture Equipment Performance\n\nContent: equipment. 7.4.5 Where it is inefficient to have support and/or facilities infrastructure equipment supplied to meet the same specifications as process equipment, the facility electrical distribution system may be required to compensate for any specification gap.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.5  Monitoring Strategies (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.5  Monitoring Strategies\n\nContent: 7.5.1 Use power disturbance monito rs and/or digital fault recorders to monitor voltage to detect compliance (see IEEE 1159). Monitor current to identify disturbance sources and assist in solutions. 7.5.2 Locate continuous monitoring at the electrical utility service, all major facility electrical distribution centers, and all critical equipment electrical points of connection. Perform periodic monitoring for at least one location of each equipment type in order to characterize the electrical environment under normal conditions (i.e., to create a baseline). Additional monitoring should be performed when experiencing unexplained operational problems. A comparison of baseline data to monitored data for equipment experiencing problems is recommended for evaluating the power supplied to the equipment. 7.5.3 Provide time synchronization f or multiple monitors to allow for the correlation of a single voltage sag event between all monitors. 7.5.4 In order to understand the imp act, correlate monitored voltage sag\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.5  Monitoring Strategies (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.5  Monitoring Strategies\n\nContent: events with known wafer processing effects within the process equipment.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6  Measuring and Modeling Stra tegies (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6  Measuring and Modeling Stra tegies\n\nContent: 7.6.1 A single voltage sag event orig inating outside the factory will vary in magnitude and duration when measured at differing locations throughout the facility. This is largely due to differing lengths and type of distribution conductors feeding equipment located throughout the facility. In addition, the electrical interactions of the reactive and non-linear elements of equipment effect the voltage sag measurements. 7.6.2 Voltage sag events that origina te within the facility electrical distribution system will vary in magnitude and duration when measured at differing locations throughout the facility. These voltage sag events are usually a result of a current flow increase and the associated voltage drop across the conductors between the source and load. The location along the current flow path greatly effects the voltage sag measured. 7.6.3 Computer design tools should be used to model the electrical distribution system in order to calculate anticipated voltage sags for utility or site\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6  Measuring and Modeling Stra tegies (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6  Measuring and Modeling Stra tegies\n\nContent: originated faults. If limitations exist such that voltage sag monitors are not located at every piece of equipment, then event measurements can be adjusted from modeling information to determine voltage sag values at other locations. 7.6.4 As a means for measuring effe ctiveness in a business environment, it would be useful to statistically model the effect of voltage sag events on the manufacturing processes. The variations mentioned in Section 7.3.2, above, preclude a deterministic approach to how well a wafer fabrication process will perform for a given voltage sag event. A statistical correlation model would aid in estimating the correlation between voltage sags and manufacturing cost, and can be used to validate the effectiveness of power enhancement and conditioning programs.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling\n\nContent: 7.6.5.1 A voltage sag event originatin g on the electrical utility system often exhibits different characteristics when measured at different locations on facility electrical distribution systems. The variance in voltage sag characteristics can create different effects on similar equipment. Variances can usually be explained by examining 1) the characteristics of voltage sag at the utility interfaces, 2) the type and connection configuration of voltage transformations, and 3) the voltage levels and corresponding phase relationships at the terminals of infrastructure, support, and process equipment within the facility. 7.6.5.2 The types of faults that can oc cur on a utility system are: Line to line to line, Line to line to line to ground, Line to line, Line to line to ground, and Line to ground. 7.6.5.3 The utility network can be mo deled to predict the voltage sag characteristics due to various types of faults at the electrical interfaces between a semiconductor manufacturing facility and\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling\n\nContent: utility. The most common utility system fault type is a single line to ground fault. An example of the translation of a voltage sag resulting from a line to ground voltage sag event is provided in the following sections. 7.6.5.4 Typical voltage transformation s from the utility interface to utilization voltage levels are illustrated in Figure 3. Under normal conditions, the three phase voltages are all approximately equal and displaced $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ from each other. During a voltage sag event due to an unbalanced fault, this relationship changes. Delta-wye transformers between the origin of the fault and the equipment being studied will further affect the phase and magnitude relationships. The degree to which voltage phase shift and magnitude changes occur at each transformation throughout the facility distribution system should be considered when examining impacts on individual equipment. 7.6.5.5 Figure 4 illustrates the variatio ns in magnitude of a voltage sag event within a facility\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling\n\nContent: during a single line to ground fault on a utility transmission line. This example illustrates a worst case situation, where a single-phase fault occurs at a substation transformer primary-side terminal. (See Related Documents section.) 7.6.5.6 Many devices in process, supp ort, and facilities infrastructure equipment are not connected to all three phases. Because the voltage sag response of these devices may dictate the sag response for the entire equipment assembly, understanding device connection configuration and sag response characteristics is of critical importance. Sag depth and duration, the point on the wave at which the sag begins, and the corresponding phase relationships are all known to be factors in determining the sag response of many common devices. 7.6.5.7 Figure 4 illustrates the importa nce of phase relationships in the sag response of a 120-volt control circuit emergency off (EMO) relay which is connected to phase A (or phase B) in a 208-volt facility distribution system\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.6.5  Example of Voltage Sag Event Modeling\n\nContent: derived with only one low voltage transformation. In this example the voltage sags to only $8 8 \\%$ of nominal on these phases, but drops to $33 \\%$ of nominal on phase C. The industry specification for semiconductor processing equipment voltage sag immunity does not specify that equipment ride-through a sag to $33 \\%$ of nominal voltage. 7.6.5.8 If two low voltage transformat ions were used to derive the 208-volt facility system (see Figure 4), phase B voltage would be unaffected during the utility voltage sag, but phases A and C would sag to $58 \\%$ of nominal. Industry standards typically require equipment to ride-through a sag of this depth. However, a tolerance designed into the facility system may be necessary to provide adequate system protection.\n\nSEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.7  Power Enhancing and Conditioning Strategies (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F49-0200 GUIDE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY SYSTEMS VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.7  Power Enhancing and Conditioning Strategies\n\nContent: 7.7.1 While it is desirable to reduce and eliminate battery storage devices provided by equipment suppliers with individual pieces of process equipment, battery storage devices may be appropriate as a centralized or distributed part of a facilities distribution system (when evaluated in a systems approach to power enhancement and conditioning). 7.7.2 Facility power systems enhanc ements should be examined on a case-by-case approach to determine the appropriate measure of power conditioning to be applied. In general, the following types of equipment are frequently used to mitigate the effects of utility voltage sag events in semiconductor factories.

In particular, this guide focuses on electric utility power quality performance goals that are complementary to voltage sag immunity levels for semiconductor processing equipment and facilities infrastructure equipment (see Figure 1). Recommendations for measuring and evaluating voltage sag performance, evaluating utility system enhancements, and implementation of a continuous improvement process are included since no electric utility industry standards exist. 1.2 Utility systems are designed, c onstructed, and operated to meet utility industry regulations and requirements. One important requirement for semiconductor factories is power system reliability. Utilities measure reliability in minutes of voltage outages per customer per year. Semiconductor factories require a high level of power system\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: reliability, any service outage is usually unacceptable. A second important requirement is power quality. Power quality relates to disturbed voltage waveforms, not outages. When utilities implement measures to increase power system reliability, power quality can be adversely affected. The structured approach defined in this guide can achieve high levels of power quality without sacrificing power reliability. 1.3 The intent of this guide is to he lp semiconductor manufacturers achieve both high levels of power reliability and power quality from energy utility providers. By becoming familiar with the cause and effect relationships of voltage sag events on the utility’s side of the electric meter, semiconductor manufacturers and electric utilities can work together to pursue efficient solutions for improved voltage sag ridethrough in semiconductor factories. 2.1 The scope of this guide extend s beyond a discussion of typical electric utility reliability and quality improvement techniques to developing a continuous\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: improvement process for electric utility voltage sag performance (depicted graphically in Figure 2). Factors in this process include the following: Define desired performance criteria by setting goals for voltage sag event duration and magnitude (see Section 6.1). Measure performance for both proposed and existing semiconductor factory sites (see Section 6.2). Summarize voltage sag event data and identify the impact on semiconductor processing and facilities infrastructure equipment (see Section 6.3). Recommend improvements that include consideration of cost, benefit, and risk. Improvements can include corrective action to eliminate system faults, changes to service configurations, and power enhancements (see Section 6.4). Select and implement improvements. Establish a continuous improvement process (see Section 6.5). 2.2 For the purposes of this docum ent, the term Electric Utility refers to energy service providers (that sell energy to semiconductor manufacturers) and/or electric transmission and distribution\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: providers (that deliver energy through their power lines). 2.3 This guide does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

Events can be identified and categorized within the realm of the electric utility or the semiconductor manufacturer. Industry specifications for semiconductor processing equipment voltage sag immunity (which define the level of voltage sag immunity required for semiconductor processing equipment) are recommended as a performance goal. Using this goal for the performance of electric utility services will provide consistency with semiconductor processing equipment capabilities.

To insure that power quality considerations are properly factored into the site selection process, a selection factor should be assigned to power quality and reliability criteria. 6.2.1.2 Utility electrical service config urations should be considered when measuring and comparing reliability and power quality performance at different locations. The load profile for the proposed factory is used to determine the standard utility electrical service configuration. Usually, larger factories $( > ~ 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ M W } ) }$ exceed allowable loading for lower voltage distribution systems $( < 6 9 \\mathrm { ~ k V } )$ , therefore a high voltage service is the typical configuration for larger semiconductor factories. Selection of the highest available service voltage is preferred for reliability due to two factors. First, the area\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.2.1  Measuring Performance at Proposed Semiconductor Factory Sites (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.2.1  Measuring Performance at Proposed Semiconductor Factory Sites\n\nContent: of exposure is greater for lower voltages since they include both higher and lower voltage system distribution lines and equipment. Second, higher voltage systems can provide energy to lower voltage system faults with little or no impact to high voltage system voltages, whereas, lower voltage systems are greatly impacted by faults not buffered by transformers. 6.2.1.3 The preferred method for comparing power quality and reliability from different locations involves creating a summary of the number of voltage sag events that fall into different magnitude-duration categories. Data from different categories should be adjusted by weighting factors to enable valid comparison.

The risks should be identified for taking no action, the possibility that events will occur during the implementation of improvements, and that events will occur as a result of unknown factors resulting from the installation of improvements. Improvements can include corrective action to eliminate system faults, changes to service configurations, and power enhancements. 6.4.2 Corrective action to eliminate system faults. 6.4.2.1 The key to influencing an elec tric utility’s voltage sag performance is mutual understanding of measurement and improvement processes. Voltage sags on utility electric systems are created because of faults (short circuits) caused by a variety of events, including lightning, trees contacting power lines, equipment failure,\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4  Recommend Improvements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4  Recommend Improvements\n\nContent: and vehicles striking power poles. In order to reduce the number of voltage sag events, it is important to understand the specific cause of each fault. Semiconductor manufacturers should request that electric utilities share disturbance investigation reports and statistics. If data is not available, or tracking fault causes is not a focus (many utilities track only outage causes) then a fault tracking system should be established. 6.4.2.2 Many times, the initially ident ified fault cause (for example lightning) has a more specific cause (for example a contaminated insulator), with an even more specific root cause (for example salt contamination on coastal power lines in dry weather seasons). Identifying this root cause helps to establish the appropriate corrective action (for example, improved insulator cleaning practices to include weather considerations on coastal lines). Semiconductor manufacturers and their electric utilities should work together to ensure voltage sag event root cause\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4  Recommend Improvements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4  Recommend Improvements\n\nContent: identification processes exists. 6.4.2.3 Analysis steps for electric utili ties to identify the root cause of system faults include the following: Step 1 Locate the fault and identify what initiated the fault. Step 2 Investigate the underlying causes of the fault to discover the root cause. Step 3 Track faults and root causes in a database. Step 4 Identify corrective actions. 6.4.2.4 Some of the more obvious cor rective actions include additional animal guards on exposed electrical devices to reduce the effects from inadvertent touch. Additional patrols and early removal of birds nests, sources of nesting material, reduction in potential roosting and nesting sites, sealing any possible entry to electrical equipment against wildlife intrusion, and designs using larger phase spacing and higher Basic Impulse Insulation Levels (BIL) are just some of the ways that events can be eliminated.\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.3  Service Configurations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.3  Service Configurations\n\nContent: 6.4.3.1 Determine the factors that are fixed for the purposes of improvement development and evaluation. Some examples include, but are not limited to, physical location of site, utility system configuration beyond the immediate vicinity of the site, and electric rate structures. 6.4.3.2 Once the electrical reliability a nd power quality needs of a semiconductor factory are identified and the reliability and power quality of the electrical network in the area has been characterized, electric utility service configuration can be considered. The electric utility and the semiconductor manufacturer should jointly develop a plan that balances reliability and power quality. This plan should consider the following service configuration options. 6.4.3.3 High voltage service configura tions. 6.4.3.3.1 Utility electrical service config urations have a significant effect on the levels of power quality and reliability. Semiconductor manufacturing facilities can typically derive the highest service\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.3  Service Configurations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.3  Service Configurations\n\nContent: quality and reliability from electrical service provided at the highest voltage level. By bringing service to the semiconductor factory from the highest available voltage system, semiconductor facilities can eliminate their exposure to electrical disturbances on lower voltage systems. Seldom are disturbances that result from events originating in lower voltage systems transferred into the higher voltage systems to any significant degree. Utility industry studies have indicated approximately $6 0 { - } 7 5 \\%$ fewer voltage sag events (below $70 \\%$ of nominal) on the high voltage systems. 6.4.3.3.2 For plants with loads greater th an $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { M W }$ , the highest voltage available is usually service at a voltage between $6 9 \\ \\mathrm { k V }$ and $3 4 5 ~ \\mathrm { k V }$ .

Where $\\mathbf { N }$ is the number of components required to operate for maximum loading conditions and $+ 1$ indicates a single additional component that will operate to maintain the system capability in the event that one of the original components is out-of-service. If the plant is to be operated with no annual shutdowns for maintenance, then the system should be designed with enough redundancy to maintain every component in the plant without dropping service to any load. This requires at least a dual feed system that originates with two or more utility sources and continues throughout the semiconductor factory with appropriate transfer schemes to keep the loads energized at all times and to transfer loads without interruptions. 6.4.3.4.2 The most reliable service is one where there are multiple sources connected in a network to the semiconductor factory. This\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.3.4  Redundancy.

If a network is not available, a dual feed system can be configured to provide an immediate transfer to the backup system in the case of primary source failure, reducing outage time to near zero. Additionally, if the two sources are independent, a static transfer switch may increase quality to a level higher than that of a network. If only one source is available to a semiconductor factory with a load of less than five megawatts, an alternative is on site generation combined with a voltage sag ridethrough system.\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.3.5  Minimize exposure.\n\n6.4.3.5.1  When choosing source configurations, it is important to consider exposure at the semiconductor factory site.  The more line length the factory is connected to, the more exposure there is.  \na) It might not be desirable to have three lines serving the plant if one is a long line that is prone to failures.  As a rule of thumb, more than three lines connected in a network may reduce quality without adding significantly to reliability.\nb) If service is taken from a distribution class circuit, then consider purchasing a so-called express or dedicated feeder from the utility to isolate the plant from neighboring facilities.\nc) Review the line routes with the utility and consider changes to reduce exposures, such as: where the poles are vulnerable to being struck by vehicles, or where trees are growing close to the transmission lines.\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.4  Power Enhancements Technologies (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.4  Power Enhancements Technologies\n\nContent: 6.4.4.1 All disturbances will not be eli minated from the utility grid. In order to achieve the next step in plant protection, it may be necessary to implement some type of custom power option. Custom power is so called because it is thought to be a custom solution tailored to the needs of the process and the unique situation of the site. Custom power options usually involve some type of power enhancement and conditioning system. These power electronics systems are most often connected between the semiconductor factory and the electric utility at the point of common coupling (also known as the electrical service point). Many custom power options include some energy storage to ride through the disturbance, but they are usually designed to carry the factory through only momentary interruptions. In fact, for large factories $( > 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { M W } )$ some available ride-through systems only operate to boost the voltage during sags and will not carry the factory site through even\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.4  Power Enhancements Technologies (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.4.4  Power Enhancements Technologies\n\nContent: short outages. The trade-off is cost versus protection. The systems should be economically evaluated as well as matched technically to the needs of the site. 6.4.4.2 Electric utility provided custom power options should be balanced against factory system voltage sag immunity covered in industry guide for factory systems voltage sag immunity.\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # 6.5  Select and Implement Improvements\n\n6.5.1  Both the electric utility and the semiconductor manufacturer should agree criteria methodology for prioritizing improvements.

As part of the EPRI\\* Distribution Power Quality (DPQ) study, data was collected for a two-year period from approximately 300 different BMI PQNode monitors. These monitors were located on 100 different feeders at 24 geographically dispersed utilities. The power quality database created in conjunction with this study is probably the most extensive in existence. The data derived from this study provides a statistically based assessment of the level of power quality on electric utility distribution circuits (voltage range from $4 . 1 6 \\mathrm { k V }$ to $3 4 . 5 \\mathrm { k V } ,$ ). R1-1.2 Almost every category of power quality data was collected in the DPQ study, however, only voltage sag and interruption data is assumed to be pertinent to\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # R1-1  Typical Electric Utility System Performance (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # R1-1  Typical Electric Utility System Performance\n\nContent: this activity. In the DPQ study, a voltage sag event was initiated when the rms voltage dropped below $9 5 \\%$ of nominal for one cycle (data analysis was performed only for events with magnitudes less than or equal to $9 0 \\%$ ). An interruption event was initiated when the voltage dropped below $10 \\%$ of nominal for 120 seconds. Although waveforms were captured for most sag and interruption events, almost all of the data analysis was performed on the basis of minimum voltage magnitude (as a percentage on nominal) and maximum duration during the event.\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # R1-1.3  DPQ Key Results\n\nThe average interruption rate per site, per month was approximately 0.5.\nThe average sag rate per site, per month was approximately 4 $( 1 0 \\% < \\mathbf { V } < = 9 0 \\% )$ ).\nThe ratio of voltage sags to interruptions was approximately 10:1.\nAlmost all voltage sag events have only a single component.\nMost voltage sags had duration of less than 10 cycles.  \nR1-1.4  The Figure R1-1 represents a summary of the voltage sag and interruption data in a contour format.

However, only one of the semiconductor manufacturing sites from which data was collected is served from a typical utility distribution system. Fourteen of the fifteen semiconductor sites surveyed were served from dedicated substations owned by either the customer or the utility. A comparison between DPQ and semiconductor site data (for large facilities) indicates that application of DPQ data would yield a more restrictive tool tolerance standard. It is recommended, therefore, that data from semiconductor sites be utilized to develop an initial curve and that the curve be validated against DPQ data. R1-2.2 Voltage sag and interruption data was accumulated for 14 different semiconductor manufacturing sites geographically dispersed throughout the United States. One additional site was located outside of the United States. Data represented in this report was\n\nSEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # R1-2  Semiconductor Factory Site Disturbance Data (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F50-0200 GUIDE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY VOLTAGE SAG PERFORMANCE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES - # R1-2  Semiconductor Factory Site Disturbance Data\n\nContent: provided by semiconductor manufacturing companies. R1-2.3 All of the data collected was in the form of magnitude and duration point values. Although the validity of characterizing the electrical system performance is this manner has been questioned, it remains the most common data format for disturbance data. R1-2.4 The coverage of the disturbance data is typically represented as the product of number of years (or months) monitored and the number of monitors present. In this report, the unit for data coverage is Monitor-Years. One Monitor-Year of data is the quantity of data derived by one monitor for a one-year period. The data for semiconductor sites covers 30.5 Monitor-Years. The minimum coverage for a site was 0.8 Monitor-Years (one monitor for 10 months). The site with the maximum coverage had eight MonitorYears of data. The average for all sites was approximately 1.9 Monitor-Years.

The graph represents the magnitudes and duration for all voltage sags and interruptions at all sites. The magnitude value is the minimum voltage level during the sag represented as a percent of the nominal voltage. Also shown on the graph is the pertinent portion of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) “CBEMA-curve,” contained in IEEE Standards 446 and 1100. R1-2.6 The total number of events on or below the CBEMA curve was 166. Thirteen of the fifteen semiconductor sites averaged at least one event below the CBEMA each year. The average number of events below CBEMA, per site, each year was approximately 5.4. If the semiconductor manufacturers employed the new CBEMA curve for a tolerance standard, most would have experienced a significant number of equipment interruptions.

The bin tables are themselves useful as a tool for comparison of voltage sag performance of electrical systems. The paragraphs and tables below have been included to explain the use of bins in the standardization of historical or predicted events. R2-1.2 Table R2-1 shows a grid of nine sag magnitude ranges in rows and five sag duration ranges in columns. The combination of nine rows and five columns produce a total of 45 magnitude/duration bins. Each measured or predicted sag will have a magnitude and duration that fits in only one of the 45 bins. The magnitude bin is a range of sag voltages expressed as a percentage of nominal. The time bin is a range of sag durations expressed as seconds.

The number in each table entry will correspond to the number of sags that have magnitudes and times in the same bins. Interruptions would go into the lower row of bins according to the duration. The number bins may vary depending on coordination needs for a particular case. However, this selection of 45 bins is reasonably convenient. R2-1.3 For this example, assume each of the 45 bins contains one sag event. This means there are 45 sags per year and the characteristics of each sag fits in a unique bin. The 15 bins in the lower-right corner have bold italic highlighting to promote understanding as this example continues. R2-1.4 Table R1-2 shows the cumulative number of sag events that are worse than or equal to each bin from Table R1-1. “Worse than” means the magnitude is lower and the duration is longer.

The most common sealing requirements in DI water systems are filters, valves, flow and pressure regulators, and fittings. 7.2 Contaminants in DI water fall primarily into three categories. They are ion contamination, T.O.C.’s and bacterial growth. Contaminant levels are usually measured in parts per billion (PPB). 7.3 Ion contamination problems ar e caused by anionic and cationic elements in DI water such as fluorides, chlorides, sulfates, etc. These can be leached from seals as well as the DI plumbing. 7.4 Cations (mostly metallic ions) are leached from seals as well as the plumbing that delivers the DI water. In order to kill bacteria which have a propensity to grow in DI water, the water is either heated $( 8 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } + )$ , ozonated, or bombarded with UV light, or possibly a combination of these three elements.

T.O.C.’s are of great concern since they can adhere to wafers and result in degraded oxide quality and hazy films. Ozone and UV deterioration of the seals usually leads to particulate contamination. These can be as small as single atoms or molecules to gross particle size contamination. 7.6 Considerations: What method of sterilization (i.e., chemical, thermal or radiation)? Concerns for cations, anions, or T.O.C.’s? Seal life expectation?\n\nSEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 8  Considerations for Use in Corrosives (Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 8  Considerations for Use in Corrosives (Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents\n\nContent: NOTE 3: See Figure 2. 8.1 Inorganic wet chemicals at hig h concentration levels and in some cases at elevated temperatures are readily used in front-end semiconductor processing in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. Most common sealing requirements are in acid recirculation and chemical distribution systems (mostly BCD’s). Component systems include pumps, filters, megasonic seals, gaskets for pipeline interfaces and valves. 8.2 Of primary concern when spec ifying a specific seal for an application are issues relating to resistance to chemical reaction. Design considerations should include resistance to chemical breakdown, static vs. dynamic environments, pressure, temperature, leachables, particle generation. 8.3 Chemical and Thermal Degrad ation involves the incompatibility of the seals to the process chemistries. An example is Hydroflouric Acid (HF) dissolves silicone elastomers. The same is true of temperature degradation (i.e., Piranha or Phosphoric Acids) where the\n\nSEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 8  Considerations for Use in Corrosives (Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 8  Considerations for Use in Corrosives (Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents\n\nContent: process temperature causes thermally and chemically induced effects on the seal. That also contributes to the mechanical failure of the seal. 8.4 Leaching is most commonly a ssociated with metal filler systems of the seal, which usually introduce metallic ions. This is a continuous occurrence as long as the seal is in the system. 8.4.1 Particles Particles can be th e result of mechanical damage of the seal or as a result of leaching or chemical degradation or foreign material present on the seal surface. Particles can end up on the wafer and cause defects. 8.4.2 Summary All cases of the above contamination can create electrical shorts, voids, and unwanted doping. 8.4.3 Solvents Incompatibility of elastomers or seals with solvent chemistries may cause contamination. 8.4.3.1 For example, there are degrees of incompatibility: 8.4.3.1.1 If the seal is dissolved by the s olvent, then a catastrophic failure occurs where the solvent leaks out of the liquid process loop. This is\n\nSEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 8  Considerations for Use in Corrosives (Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 8  Considerations for Use in Corrosives (Acids, Bases), Oxidizers, and Solvents\n\nContent: associated with misprocessed wafers. 8.4.3.1.2 Another type of solvent seal in teraction is the swelling of the elastomer or the leaching of small amounts of elastomer. Excessive swelling of the elastomer can result in premature seal failures and a higher cost of ownership caused by increased frequency of seal change outs.\n\nSEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 9  Considerations for Use In Thermal Processes\n\nNOTE 4: See Figure 3.  \n9.1  Diffusion processes are used p rimarily for growth of oxide layers and to anneal crystal damage caused by implant.  Diffusion furnaces are usually batch process equipment where the process atmosphere is constrained within quartz tubes.  The seals of these tubes are exposed to temperatures of $2 5 0 { - } 3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .  This requires  \nthat the seals not only be capable of withstanding these high temperatures but also that they not out-gas or permeate adversely affecting the purity of the process. Also of concern is the possible particle generation caused by the seals as they expand and contract due to temperature cycling (see Section 8.4.1).  \n9.1.1  Factors include:  \nTemperature capability of material and process temperature.\nStatic or dynamic state of seal.\nProper sizing and fit of seal to gland.\n\nSEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # 10  Considerations for Use in Plasma Systems (Etch, CVD, and PVD)\n\nNOTE 5:  See Figure 4.  \n10.1  Considerations for sealing components for use in plasma applications shall include proximity to plasma, plasma reactor temperature, chemical composition of plasma, plasma energy, and chemical leaching by the plasma.  \n10.2 Contamination from the inhere nt seal components and particle generation is directly related to other considerations mentioned above.  \n10.2.1  Factors include:  \nSeal composition and resistance to chemical attack.\nProximity to source and intensity of RF.\nTemperature capability of material and process temperature.\nStatic or dynamic state of seal.\nProper sizing and fit of seal to gland.\n\nSEMI F51-0200 GUIDE FOR ELASTOMETRIC SEALING TECHNOLOGY - # Categories for Consideration\n\nCategories for Consideration  \nCategories for Consideration  \nCategories for Consideration  \nNOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the guides set forth herein for any particular application.

Aerosols are produced by nebulizing a solution of NaCl in water.  After drying and charge neutralization, particles of the required size are extracted from the aerosol using an electrostatic classifier (EC).  The concentration of particles in the resulting monodisperse aerosol is then recorded by the CNC and compared to that measured simultaneously by a reference instrument. Examples of suitable reference instruments are described in Section 8.8.  \nNOTE 4: This method has been shown to provide repeatable results in tests performed in separate laboratories on similar CNCs.  Examples of these tests are found in Agarwal and $\\mathrm { s e m } ^ { 3 }$ and Bartz, et al4.\n\nSEMI F54-1000 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF CONDENSATION NUCLEUS COUNTERS - # 7  Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F54-1000 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF CONDENSATION NUCLEUS COUNTERS - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: 7.1 The reference instrument must have a proven counting efficiency of not less than $9 5 \\%$ over the entire range of particle sizes tested. Low counting efficiency in the reference instrument results in an error in the measured particle concentration. The counting efficiency for the reference instrument must be checked by the manufacturer against a calibrated standard, such as a calibrated aerosol electrometer. 7.2 Coincidence error in either the CNC or the reference instrument causes inaccuracy in the measured particle concentration. The concentration limit for each instrument must be obtained from the manufacturer’s specifications. The particle concentration in the aerosol standard must be kept below both concentration limits. 7.3 When an aerosol electrometer is used as the reference instrument, the minimum detectable particle concentration must be obtained from the manufacturer’s specifications. A particle concentration below the minimum detectable value will cause inaccurate results. The\n\nSEMI F54-1000 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF CONDENSATION NUCLEUS COUNTERS - # 7  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F54-1000 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF CONDENSATION NUCLEUS COUNTERS - # 7  Requirements\n\nContent: particle concentration in the aerosol standard must be kept above the minimum detectable particle concentration. 7.4 The transport loss of particles from the EC to the CNC, and from the EC to the reference instrument must be checked. Any disparity in particle transport loss to the two instruments will cause erroneous results. The method for calculating the transport loss of particles in sample lines is found in Pui, et al5. The transport loss must be calculated for each particle size tested. Record all transport loss calculations. 7.5 When an aerosol electrometer is used as the reference instrument, a correction must be made for multiple charging of particles in the aerosol standard. Multiple charging can cause substantial error when measuring particles larger than 0.06 micrometer. The correction factor for multiple charging must be obtained from the manufacturer of the EC. An example of the method for calculating the correction factor is found in Liu and $\\mathrm { P u i } ^ { 6 }$ .\n\nSEMI F54-1000 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF CONDENSATION NUCLEUS COUNTERS - # 8  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F54-1000 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING THE COUNTING EFFICIENCY OF CONDENSATION NUCLEUS COUNTERS - # 8  Apparatus\n\nContent: 8.1 Atomizer — A sub-micromete r aerosol generator capable of nebulizing a liquid solution.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on April 10, 2000.  Initially available on www.semi.org May 2000; to be published June 2000.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  A mass flow controller (MFC) is often used to control corrosive gases under unfavorable conditions. This test method is intended to help differentiate between MFC designs on the basis of relative resistance to corrosion-induced failure.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This test is intended to show th e effect of corrosion caused when a corrosive gas such as HCl is contaminated by an oxidizer such as atmospheric moisture.  For the purpose of this test HCl is the preferred test gas, however this test can also be performed with other gasses.  This test method describes a corrosive gas exposure test for mass flow controllers.  The test is intended to accelerate the corrosion while simulating conditions that may be found within process equipment and gas systems in the semiconductor industry.  As the relationship between corrosion and performance may differ with MFC design, corrosion is not measured directly.  The effects of corrosion are detected by observing changes in MFC calibration and other operating parameters.  \n2.2  This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  This test method should not be expected to yield comparable quantitative results from one test facility to another.  \n3.2  Results may be compromised by the methods used to construct the apparatus.  \n3.3  This test is designed to be a de structive test.  The MFC tested will be destroyed.  This test is intended only for MFCs manufactured for use in HCl or a similar highly corrosive gaseous environment. MFCs manufactured for non-corrosive service may develop leaks or other catastrophic failures if tested by this method.  For practical reasons in constructing and operating the test bed, test samples may be limited to 100 sccm ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ equivalent full scale (FS) flow.  \n3.4  This method does not measure corrosion directly by analyzing or inspecting the gas-wetted surfaces following exposure to a corrosive.  No attempt is made to detect particles in the exit gas stream resulting from the corrosion process.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 4  Referenced Documents\n\nSEMI F1 — Specification for Leak Integrity of HighPurity Gas Piping Systems and Components  \nNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be the latest publications of adopted standards.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Acronyms and Abbreviations  \n5.1.1  DUT — device under test  \n5.1.2  FS — full scale  \n5.1.3  kPa — kiloPascal  \n5.1.4  MFC — mass flow controller  \n5.1.5  MFM — mass flow meter  \n5.1.6  ppbv — parts per billion by vo lume  \n5.1.7  ppmv — parts per million by v olume  \n5.1.8  sccm — standard cubic centim eters per minute using a standard temperature of $0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ and a standard pressure of $1 0 1 . 3 2 \\mathrm { k P a }$ .\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 5.2  Definitions\n\n5.2.1  actual flow — for the purpose of this standard, the output value of the reference flowmeter.  \n5.2.2  ambient temperature — the te mperature of the medium surrounding the device.

The test MFC is monitored over time for changes in performance resulting from corrosion.  \n6.2  This test is intended to be an a ccelerated simulation of the effects of alternating corrosive and moisture-exposure conditions.  The test records how long it takes for corrosion to affect calibration.  MFCs that are more resistant to corrosion failures should last longer under the test conditions.  A dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ purge separates each MFC's exposure to the corrosive gas and to the moisture-containing gas.  This purging favors MFC designs that perform well in corrosive service because those MFCs can be dried out quickly with limited purging.  \n6.3  This method is expected to yie ld data that can be used to compare the relative performance of components tested for the purpose of qualification.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 7  Interference’s\n\n7.1  Portions of the gas system exp osed to HCl may require replacement or cleaning and refurbishment between test sequences to avoid invalidating subsequent tests by prematurely contaminating DUTs.  Take care in the design and maintenance of the system so that particles shed from upstream piping components as a byproduct of corrosion are minimized so that they do not affect the DUT.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 8  Apparatus\n\n8.1  Containment System  to con tain corrosive gas leaks that may develop in the DUT or gas system.  The portion of the system that contains the corrosive gas should be operated in a suitable secondary containment environment.  \n8.2  Power Supply, Controls, and Data Collection Devices  capable of recording data 20 times per second.  Signals should be measured with a resolution of one $\\mathrm { m V }$ or better.  Data may be recorded in convenient units such as volts, sccm, or percent of FS. For the purpose of analysis and reporting, data should be converted to percent of FS except for valve drive, which may be reported in either percent of maximum drive or volts.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 8.3  DUT (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 8.3  DUT\n\nContent: 8.4 Data Acquisition System — Re commended as a data collection system to facilitate test sequencing and data collection. 8.5 Plumbing — with tubing and g as-switching valves constructed from 316L electropolished stainless steel or other material that exhibits superior corrosion resistance compared to 316L. The use of materials such as plastics, which retain or are permeable to water vapor, are not appropriate. All-metal sealed valves (no elastomers) are readily available and must be used. 8.6 The test plumbing is intended to represent the technology level found in the semiconductor process gas piping in which a typical DUT will operate. 8.7 A filter has not been specified immediately upstream of the DUT because it would harbor contaminates and make it difficult to alternate gas types. 8.8 Dry N2 Source — pressure reg ulated source with a moisture level no greater than 50 ppbv. 8.9 Dry HCl Source — pressure re gulated source with a moisture level no greater than 500 ppbv. 8.10 Reference Flowmeter traceable with\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 8.3  DUT (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 8.3  DUT\n\nContent: calibration certificate, calibrated for ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ , FS flow $100 \\%$ to $12 5 \\%$ of the FS ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ equivalent flow range of the DUT Accuracy better than $5 \\%$ , linear to $0 . 5 \\%$ FS repeatable to $0 . 1 5 \\%$ over a three-hour period, and reproducible to $0 . 3 \\%$ of the test flow for the duration of the test .

This standard does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.  \nNOTE 3: The DUT will be contaminated with corrosive material at the conclusion of this test.  Caution should be exercised in handling.  A contaminated DUT should be properly decontaminated.  \n10.2  Become familiar with the safe handling practices associated with the corrosive gas before undertaking this test.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: 11.1 The test apparatus is the sourc e of three gases— dry $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ , dry HCl, and ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ containing a known level of water vapor. Each gas can be valved through the DUT individually with minimal cross contamination. The DUT actively controls the gas flow in each case. The gas then flows into either a scrubbed exhaust system for safe disposal or a reclamation system. A reference flowmeter in the dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ supply line is used to detect changes in calibration of the DUT when dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ is flowing in series through both devices. 11.2 Setup and Schematic — See Figure 1 for a schematic of the test apparatus. This schematic may not show in detail all the components required in an actual system. 11.3 Supply the manufacturer's reco mmended power to the DUT. Provide MFC setpoint and purge command (if available). Monitor the following: 11.3.1 DUT setpoint input. 11.3.2 DUT indicated flow output. 11.3.3 DUT valve drive output (if ava ilable) 11.3.4\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: actual flow (output of referenc e flowmeter) 11.4 Verify that the proper moisture levels exist in each of the test gases. 11.5 Provide a purge flow loop that maintains a constant flow of dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ in the line from the DUT to the exhaust system. Flow in this loop must be sufficient to prevent back diffusion into the DUT of moisture generated in the exhaust system, particularly when flow into the DUT is shut off for measuring zero. 11.6 If the moisture generator is sup plied from the same ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ source that supplies the dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ , take precautions to avoid the diffusion of moisture from the moisture generator into the dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ line. Such precautions may include the use of separate pressure regulators and other valving. 11.7 Moisture generators typically t ake time to stabilize. A continuous flow should be maintained through the moisture generator during the test to maintain a stable moisture flow. This may require diverting the output flow\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: to a vent when not flowing through the DUT. 11.8 Periodically verify the moistur e concentration of wet ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ with a suitable moisture analyzer. 11.9 Follow manufacturer set-up pr ocedures for all equipment. 11.10 Conduct the test at an ambient temperature of 22 $\\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . 11.11 The DUT moisture generator, f lowmeters, and other instrumentation should have been stabilized at room temperature for 24 hours before beginning the tests. It is not necessary to flow gas during this stabilization time. 11.12 All portions of the plumbing s ystem that could contain HCl must be helium leak tested per SEMI F1 before introducing HCl into the system. When changing the DUT or other components, at least those portions of the system that were changed must be retested. NOTE 4: Small leaks in a corrosive gas system can become much larger without warning.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 12  Calibration and Standardi zation\n\n12.1  Calibrate all instrumentation u sing current standards that are traceable to an appropriate standards laboratory.  In the absence of appropriate standards, use manufacturer recommendations for calibration.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: NOTE 5: Refer to Figure 2 for a flowchart of the following test. 13.1 Set the pressure of each of the HCl and Dry $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ gas sources at $1 4 0 \\mathrm { \\ k P a } \\pm 5 \\%$ . Set the pressure of the N2 to the moisture generator to the appropriate value recommended by the manufacturer. If the test must be run at some other pressure, because of a limitation of the DUT, report this fact in the test results. 13.2 Start the wet ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ flow to vent o r through the moisture analyzer. Establish a stable moisture concentration at $1 0 0 \\mathrm { \\ p p m v } \\pm 2 0 \\%$ before beginning the test sequence. Set the wet ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ to flow within $\\pm 5 \\%$ of the DUT flow that will be run during the test. 13.3 Place the DUT control valve in the purge or fully open position by supplying a purge command or a $20 0 \\%$ setpoint. Purge with dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ at a rate of one to two times FS flow for one hour to establish initial conditions. The purge rate is controlled by\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: adjusting the supply pressure and is monitored by a purge-rate flowmeter located in the gas-supply path. Follow the manufacturer's procedure for fully opening the DUT control valve. 13.4 Provide a setpoint to the DUT for $8 0 \\pm 5 \\%$ of FS flow. 13.5 Determining the Test Baseline and Measurement Repeatability. NOTE 6: Data throughout this test may be recorded in a format similar to that found in Table A1.1. 13.6 Open valve V1 and flow dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ at a setpoint of $8 0 \\% \\pm 5 \\%$ of the DUT FS and wait 10 minutes. 13.7 Record: 13.7.1 DUT setpoint 13.7.2 DUT indicated flow 13.7.3 DUT valve drive output (if ava ilable) 13.7.4 Actual flow 13.8 Stop flow by closing V1. Driv e the MFC control valve to a closed position by providing a zero setpoint or as otherwise provided by the manufacturer. Allow the MFC indicated flow output to stabilize for a minimum of three minutes. 13.9 Record the DUT indicated flow and the actual flow during the zero flow condition. 13.10 Repeat Sections 13.6 through 1 3.9\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: twelve times. This will yield 12 data points for each of the six measured parameters. 13.11 For each of the six parameters recorded, perform the following calculation on the 12 baseline data points to determine the repeatability of the measurement: (highest value - lowest value) $\\times 1 0 0$ average of the 12 values 13.12 If each of the six parameters is not repeatable within $0 . 2 \\%$ during these two hours, subsequent test data may not be valid and the problem should be resolved before proceeding with the test.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.13  Baseline\n\nNOTE 7:  Use the averaged value of the measurements made in Section 13.13 for each parameter as the baseline for that parameter in the following tests.  \n13.14  Test Sequence — Without cha nging the DUT setpoint, repeat the test sequence in Sections 13.19- 13.22 every 30 minutes, continuously, 24 hours per day, seven days per week until one of the following test termination conditions is met.  \n13.15  The test should not be interrup ted because the DUT may continue to corrode during the interruption, making test results non-repeatable.  The output of the moisture generator should be measured periodically during the test sequence to ensure that it remains within the test specifications.  \n13.16  Terminate the test sequence if:  \n13.16.1  The DUT fails to function  \n13.16.2  The actual-flow shift from bas eline exceeds $2 5 \\%$\n13.16.3  The valve drive exceeds the m anufacturer's limits\n13.16.4  The DUT indicated flow differ s from commanded setpoint by $> 5 \\%$\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.16.5  The test exceeds 5000 cycles (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.16.5  The test exceeds 5000 cycles\n\nContent: 13.17 Flow dry $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ for five minutes. After five minutes, record data on the six test parameters as done in Section 13.7, interrupting flow to record the DUT indicated flow and reference flowmeter output at zero flow. After taking measurements, flow dry $\\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ again so that the total length of this step is 10 minutes. Record data as shown in Figure 3. 13.18 Flow dry HCl for seven minut es. 13.19 Repeat Section 13.19 and then proceed to Section 13.22. 13.20 Flow wet ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ for three minutes . If no test termination condition is met as described in Section 13.18, repeat Sections 13.19 - 13.22. If a test termination condition is met, proceed to Section 13.23. 13.21 After the test has been comple ted, place the DUT control valve in the purge or fully open position. Purge with dry ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ for one hour or at least 50 volume changes. Cycle the purge gas for 15 seconds on and 15 seconds off by opening and closing V1 for the duration\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.16.5  The test exceeds 5000 cycles (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.16.5  The test exceeds 5000 cycles\n\nContent: of the purge. Follow the manufacturer's procedure for fully opening the DUT control valve. NOTE 8: Verify purge flow with the reference flowmeter or by using other means. Corrosion may have rendered the control valve inoperable. An alternate approach for purging any corrosive material from the system may have to be followed.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.22  Alternate Approach to Purging .\n\n13.23  If gas cannot be purged throug h the DUT, cyclepurge each end of the DUT separately using Sections 13.26 through 13.28.  \n13.24  With valves V2 and V3 closed for the duration of the procedure, close valve V6 and pressurize both sides of the system by opening V1 and V7 for 15 seconds.  \n13.25  Vent pressure through the exh aust system by closing V1 and opening V6 for 15 seconds.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13.26  Repeat pressure and vent cycle s for a minimum of one hour.\n\n13.27  Remove the DUT.  Preserve the test system, if desired, by taking steps to exclude atmospheric moisture.  Such steps could include capping the system and shutting all valves.  Alternately, the DUT may be  \nreplaced with a spool piece.  The system can then be continuously purged with dry $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ .  \nNOTE 9:  The DUT will be contaminated with corrosive material.  See Precautions in Section 10.  Preserve the DUT for failure analysis, if desired.\n\nSEMI F55-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE CORROSION RESISTANCE OF MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 14  Calculations or Interpreta tion of Results\n\n14.1  Report data in a tabular format and graph per Appendix 1.  Any parameter which changes more than $1 \\%$ from its baseline should also be graphed.  Note the reason the test was terminated.  Test results may be summarized in a single parameter by reporting the number of test cycles to reach a $2 \\%$ shift in actual flow or to reach DUT failure, whichever occurs first.  In this test, more data is reported than is required to calculate the gross test result.  The extra data is used when analyzing test results to determine the cause of failure.
