This led to the demand for better process capabilities (i.e., higher Cpk’s), which demanded corresponding improvements in process characterization and control methodologies. At the same time other users tightened their tolerances to the point that led to over-control. Either extreme can cause a mismatch between expectations and capabilities if the risks are not carefully evaluated. A1-3.3 Capability-based sampling is perhaps the only way to rigorously transfer from inspection-based quality to process control-based quality, without incurring high risks. Statistical specifications create the environment for this to work. Once the specification is clearly defined, it can be clearly achieved. The details of capability based sampling are beyond the scope of this document, but the basic concept is easy to understand. If a process is very capable and controlled, then the system can be relied upon to create the necessary quality level with less after the fact inspection. This is good for both sides. Users get"

They have all the benefits described for normal distributions, and in some respects, they are even easier. Since lognormal processes only have one tail, checking each tail to decide which is the most critical is not necessary. Also, it has been empirically observed that lognormal processes are not as prone to mean drifting, so they tend to be more stable. The main hurdle is realizing how much error is introduced if the distribution shape is assumed to be normal when it is not. A2-3.1.1 Figure A2-1 illustrates the difference between a lognormal and a normal process. The curve which has a solid line (and is clearly not symmetrical) is the lognormal distribution. The curve with the dashed line is the normal distribution. The error when mistakenly using a normal distribution to characterize a lognormal process is shown in Table A2-1.

The basic intent is to quantify user need so suppliers can accommodate that need. Developing a clear link between user needs and the control methods used on the production floor is one of the most critical steps for creating a Total Quality Management (TQM) environment. Following are some key background concepts that allow the reader to understand the conclusions drawn in this document. A4-1.2 For most manufacturing processes there is no such thing as “zero defects”. Processes are described by statistical probability distributions, and the tails of these functions can go all the way to infinity. For many years, $9 9 . 7 3 \\%$ (i.e., $\\pm \\nobreakspace 3 \\nobreakspace$ sigma) was used as the basis for tolerances. “Within tolerance” was understood to mean within tolerance with a $9 9 . 7 3 \\%$ confidence, or a $0 . 2 7 \\%$ quality level.

In any case, this quality level needs to be agreed upon for a specification method to have meaning. It can be measured in terms of ppm, Z, Cpk (which is equal to Z divided by 3), or percent. Z tables or Cpk tables can be obtained which provide this information. A4-1.3 Errors in the $10 \\%$ or higher range can be generated if a percentile specification is based on the central portion of the distribution. An example of such a specification is $^ { 6 4 } 5 0 \\% \\leq 1 . 2$ microns”. These errors are not obvious and require careful statistical analysis based upon real process variation. Multiple percentile specifications are also difficult to apply. Paragraph A4- 3 provides more details on these issues. A4-1.4 Conversely, if specifications get too far out on the tail, they tend to become abstract and are not used as the primary factor driving quality improvements. This is especially true for non-normal processes where the tail of the distribution goes out much farther"

Now even spreadsheets have them. It should also be noted that once the process characterization has been done, the shape of the distribution typically does not change, so this knowledge can be shared throughout the industry. Regularly monitoring the process by overlaying the distribution on the process histogram or cumulative frequency plot is extremely valuable to confirm that the process is not taking on unnatural bimodal or outlier effects. One-sided distributions such as flatness and warp are so well-characterized by the lognormal distribution that “goodness-of-fit” results are very close to $100 \\%$ . Again, the error gets larger as the point-of interest moves toward the “center” of the distribution, but the major concern is the length of the tail.

Figure A4-2 Normal vs. Lognormal Shape A4-1.7 Statistical specifications quantify the quality level so it is not an abstract assumption left to conjecture. This allows both the user and supplier to optimize their control systems to that level. Capability based sampling is one example. Simply put, this means to use process capability information to help define the sampling plan for a process. A detailed discussion of this subject is beyond the scope of this document, but the basic concept is easy to understand. If a process is very capable and controlled it does not need as much sampling as one that is not. Implementing this strategy is a big step ahead of standard sampling theory. It might be the only way to rigorously transfer from inspection based quality to process control based quality, without incurring high risks. Statistical specifications create the environment which facilitates this improved strategy. Hopefully, the quality levels would be defined in"

This document has shown in detail that this is simply a wrong perception. Stating the quality level in the specification, instead of just implying it, corrects this problem. A4-2.2 Another common misconception is that tolerances and tail probabilities divert attention away from centering the process. Of course, centering is important. Considering the impact of poor quality on all customers, it is clear that a well centered process is far more efficient than one that is not. It is also generally true that the suitability of the product is not significantly different immediately on one side of a tolerance line compared to the other.

Simply monitoring the mean trend gives an excellent measure of centering, and it keeps the focus on the process rather than the specification. Industry carries a long history where specifications prevented the attainment of good process control. Many of the issues have been explained earlier in this document. To summarize, process controls are the only way to truly maintain a centered process, and these controls can only work if there is enough tolerance in the specification to accommodate the sensitivity limitations of the control methods. A4-2.2.2 The second issue is that it might not be possible to center. This is clearly the case in one-sided processes that are bounded by zero. Optimizing multiple parameters might also dictate that some parameters get worse.

Confirming that the R or S chart is controlled before studying the Xbar chart and doing an F-test before doing a t-test are just two examples. These are very important concepts that must be fully understood in order to apply statistical methods. Over-stressing centering de-emphasizes sigma and creates an environment where it is not appreciated. Thinking in terms of sigma is the most important concept that most people will learn about process control methods. It deserves a major emphasis. A4-2.2.4 Of course, centering would be a concern if mixing and matching of lots is the control method, but this can be easily spotted in the statistical characterization process.

As sample periods get longer, there is more statistical sensitivity, but also more probability that the drift will be confounded with user-driven process improvements. For example, month-to-month random drift is hard to quantify because production processes are often improved before many months of data can be observed. Measurement error is another main contributor which further complicates the other sensitivity issues. These factors all combine to allow a certain amount of undetectable process drift. This process drift needs to be considered when defining the specification approach. A4-3.4 These variations cannot be detected because of statistical sensitivity limitations.

This example (0.25 sigma of mean drift) has been used throughout this document. Since most of the discussion will relate to process drift, the terms “drift” and “shift” will be used interchangeably. Clearly, 72 is too large a sampling for most real-time control systems, but it is still an understatement of the problem. Most users currently expect their risk to be much smaller than $10 \\%$ .

The first two alternatives are really more like penalties and would lead to unnecessary loss of good material. The third is the worst form of inspecting in quality.

That reject rate must then be translated back to the tail, and $100 \\%$ sample data must be used to determine which actual pieces to reject. If the statistical distribution is defined, one specification would give the same amount of information with much less work. If only one criterion is used, and it is well out on the tail (hopefully in the ppm range) then this method is very similar to a statistical specification. A4-3.12 A commonly stated goal of multiple percentile specifications is to focus on centering rather than distribution tails.

Both techniques use reflected light to allow deduction of the thickness and refractive index of thin film layers. In both cases, film thickness and index of refraction data must be \" backed out\" of the measured optical data by a process of successive approximation. In both cases, the fitting procedure is more straightforward and more accurate the as-annealed SIMOX wafers with abrupt silicon/oxide interfaces than for the implanted SIMOX wafers with extended interface zones. Silicon islands and interface nonuniformities make these techniques problematic for SIMOX wafers with oxygen implant doses below the \" stoichiometric dose\" , roughly $\\mathrm { { 1 . 6 \\ 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { { O ^ { + } / c m ^ { 2 } } } } }$ for a $3 7 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ oxide layer. 7.1.1.1 The measurement strategy is to"

Also, surface passivation may be needed for lifetime measurements. Backside measurements indicate the quality of the substrate and can be performed by traditional methods. Frontside measurements are more difficult and must be performed using incident light which can be entirely absorbed before reaching the underlying substrate. 8.1.1 Typically, the sample is placed on a micro-wave wave guide post, forming part of a transmission line circuit.

    "content": "3.1.1  Because there is considerable variation in the scatter characteristics of different LLSs, they have been historically sized in latex sphere equivalents (LSE).  In other words, the signal received from an unknown LLS is equivalent to that which would be obtained from a polystyrene latex (PSL) sphere of known size."

    "content": "3.1.3  The instrumentation industry is building SSISs that discriminate some LLSs from others based on differences in measured scatter that depend on feature size, shape and material.  This raises the question of whether identified LLSs should continue to be sized using latex sphere equivalents, or if some new (more accurate) standard would be more acceptable.  For example, if an LLS signal could be identified as coming from a pit, then it might become appropriate to develop a standard pit wafer.  In this case, pits (either manufactured or found naturally) could be measured via atomic force microscope (AFM) and be made available on a calibration wafer to size pits via their measured scatter.  Another option, would be to use a model-based standard that resides in the SSIS software."

Defects with dimensions such that the length is at least five times the width are defined as scratches. Customers and suppliers may agree on scratch aspect ratios different from 5:1. SSIS software often provides a customer-settable aspect ratio, as well as a minimum overall length, as criteria for classification of an SSIS defect or group of defects as a scratch. Depending on SSIS design, scratch sensitivity may also be a function of scratch orientation. Currently, scratch signals are also calibrated in latex sphere equivalents; however, in the future it may become useful to calibrate scratch signals with a standard obtained from a scratch that has been either manufactured to a known size, or has been measured via AFM. 3.2.2 Haze is specified as parts per million (ppm) of measured scattered optical power relative to the"

All of the associated measurement conditions must be given (or implied) with the specified haze value. These conditions include: source incident angle (measured as a polar angle from surface normal), source polarization (S, P, other), source wavelength (or wavelength band), nominal source spot size at the wafer, haze collection angles (given as solid angles with directions). All of these quantities must be part of a haze specification, either by description, or by implication to specific instrumentation (with known or fixed parameters). 3.2.3 Haze is quantified by measuring scattered light power over one or more solid angles and then normalizing by the light power incident on the surface.

Measured haze can be expected to change if the surface is changed, or if any of the measurement parameters change. 3.2.4 Under special conditions, where the source of the haze is known, it may be possible to use a model to predict the haze reading on one instrument from the haze reading on another. For example, if on the basis of product experience and measurements on a few wafers, the surface power spectral density function can be determined, then the haze due to surface roughness can be calculated for an instrument with different parameters. Haze caused by a large number of small particles and/or film contamination is more difficult to model. 3.2.5 An SSIS often reports haze as the arithmetic average of a grid of local haze measurements taken over the FQA. This average can be, and often is, biased by wafer haze distributions that exhibit long, positively skewed tails. SSIS software is being developed that automatically calculates other haze"

Haze maps may have different levels and localized surface features may have different calculated sizes. 4.1.3 All scanning systems have a minimum LSE size of LLSs that can be reliably mapped and sized. The limitation is due to a combination of system electrical noise and the detection of non-particle light scatter signals, such as those created by Rayleigh scatter, surface roughness and system optics. Operation near this noise floor limits the utility of this guide for LLSs of those sizes. 4.1.4 Measurements made near the wafer edge often result in large numbers of"

Thus, a prospective purchaser of reclaimed silicon wafers needs to know which application matches his or her requirements. 2.2 Only requirements for some attributes are specified in Tables 1 and 2. Other requirements are indicated to be “customer specified” which means that the customer may specify a requirement for that particular attribute, “as-supplied” which means that the attribute has whatever value was supplied in the wafer delivered (or used) for reclaim, and “unspecified” which means that the attribute is not specified and for which the wafer does not need to be tested. $2 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { I n }$ addition to the general categories listed in Section 2.1, this specification provides requirements for reclaimed wafers intended for use in advanced device production, including devices in the 180 and $1 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ technology"
