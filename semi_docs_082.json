    "content": "3.1  It must be emphasized that the values of depth of focus, astigmatism, and field curvature cannot be determined for a given instrument independent of the effects of the image geometries and the image transfer process. The values will have to be determined under the constraints of a practical application process, suitable for the instrument, illumination, process, object pattern, and environment. Thus, the process to be used for a fair measure of instrument performance must be one that is appropriate and has been optimized for the given instrument and application. Comparison of the performance of two different instruments will inherently be a comparison of the the total application, instrument specific processes included. A description of the process is a necessary part of the report of a depth of focus, astigmatism or field curvature measurement. Relying on values that were obtained under significantly different application conditions from the desired application will result in error and potential unexpected process failure."

The process description will be included in the depth of focus and best focus report. 6.4 Focus Steps — The image will be printed several times, varying the defocus by a fixed amount between each print. The amount of variation of defocus between steps and the limits of the defocus will be selected so as to bracket the expected best focus position and to reach beyond the depth of focus at the extremes of the image series, as best as can be determined. The number and size of the defocus steps must be specified in the report. 6.5 Image Array — These multiple images can be a row of separate exposure fields on one substrate, multiple stepped displaced exposures of the test geometry within one image field region, or even exposures on entirely separate substrates. The particular strategy is usually constrained by the functions of the instrument under test. 6.6 Test Measurements — For each image site for both test pattern orientations and at each"

Usually this examination will use the line width as the acceptance criteria. The total number of the measurements will be twice the number of sites times the number of defocus steps. 6.7 Quantitative Image Evaluation — The photoresist image patterns will be examined or measured for deviation from the target, in a manner specified by the vendor or user of the instrument. An acceptable image is where the variation of the pattern is not outside the permissible deviation under the conditions of the intended use of the equipment. The defocus values for which the image is usable will be determined at each image site within the image field. 6.8 Depth of Focus and Best Focus Determination — The defocus variation over which there are usable images at simultaneously every test site within the field, by the above criteria, will be reported as the"

In accordance with the definition, the best focus will be the z axis position where some target specification is met or the possible defocus is maximized or the line deviation minimized, etc. If there is no common range of usable defocus across the field, the depth of focus is zero and the best focus is undetermined. This can occur due to, among other things, a large plane tilt of substrate to the optical axis, high aerial image focus surface curvature, high astigmatism, and auto focus system instabilities. 6.9 Focal Astigmatism Determination — The test measurements are separated into two groups, one group for each of the two different orthogonal orientations of the test pattern. These groups are referred to as the “S” and “T” groups, however the saggital and tangential orientations have not necessarily been used in accordance with the definition of “rotated astigmatism.” 6.9.1 For each group separately, the focal surface is determined by using for each site the midpoint of the defocus"

The focal surface which is the midpoint of the S and T focal surfaces is calculated. b. Alternatively, if point-like objects are available in the image for evaluation, the focal surface may be obtained by finding the z displacement for the best processed point image at each image site. 6.10.1 This focal surface is reported as a map of z displacements as a function of image position.
