The name is a formally reserved text string that represents the property, and the value is the current setting for that property.  \n7.1.3.2  Properties shall be accessible to the host via the service GetAttr for the Carrier object. Using SEMI E39 Object Services Standard, for example, it is possible to:  \nget the list of IDs for the current carriers at the equipment, and get the specified properties for one or more individual carriers.  \n7.1.4  Rules for Object Properties  \n• Attributes with RO access can not be changed using SetAttr service as defined in OSS. • Attributes with RW access can be changed using SetAttr service as defined in OSS. • Additional attributes may be specified by the user or the equipment supplier by using an attribute name starting with “UD” (User Defined). Care should be taken to ensure the name of the attribute is unique.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.1.5  Object Attribute Table\n\n7.1.5.1  The object attribute table is used to list all the attributes related to the defined object as shown below the access is defined as Read only (RO) or Read/Write (RW). The REQD column is used to specify whether the attribute is required for implementation. Finally, the Form column is used to specify the format of that particular attribute.  \nTable 1  Object Attribute Table\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2  State Model Methodology\n\n7.2.1  A state model has three elements: definitions of each state and sub-state, a diagram of the states and the transitions between states, and a state transition table. The diagram of the state model uses the Harel State Chart notation. An overview of this notation is presented in an Appendix of SEMI E30. The definition of this notation is presented in Science of Computer Programming 8, “Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems”, by D. Harel, $1 9 8 7 ^ { 1 }$ .\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2.2  State Model Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2.2  State Model Requirements\n\nContent: 7.2.2.1 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for CMS compliance. A state model consists of a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. All state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events. More explicitly, there must be a unique collection event for each state transition. 7.2.2.2 Equipment must maintain state models for each of the required state models as defined in this document. Equipment shall maintain individual and unique state models for each logical entity instantiated or physical entity in the equipment that has state models associated with it. The event identifier reported during a particular state transition change for each of these state models shall be shared for all associated state models but unique for each transition. For example, if the equipment has two load ports and the load port state model defines 10 transitions, there must be exactly 10 event identifiers for each load port transfer state model but\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2.2  State Model Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2.2  State Model Requirements\n\nContent: not 10 for each physical load port. The information identifying the physical entity or logical entity undergoing the transition will be contained within the associated event report. 7.2.2.3 A state model represents the host's view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internal equipment operation. All CMS state model transitions shall be mapped sequentially into the appropriate internal equipment collection events that satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of the conditions required by the CMS state model for transition to another state. In this case, the equipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in this situation. 7.2.2.4 Some equipment may need to include additional sub-states other than those in this standard. Additional substates may be added, but shall not change the CMS defined state transitions. All expected transitions between CMS states shall occur. 7.2.2.5 Transition\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2.2  State Model Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.2.2  State Model Requirements\n\nContent: tables are provided in conjunction with the state diagrams to explicitly describe the nature of each state transition. A transition table contains columns for Transition number, Previous State, Trigger, New State, Actions, and Comments. The “trigger” (column 3) for the transition occurs while in the “previous” state. The “actions” (column 5) includes a combination of: Actions taken upon exit of the previous state, Actions taken upon entry of the new state, and Actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition. 7.2.2.6 When a state model is defined with multiple AND sub-states, the equipment may report all state entry events with only one collection event. When conditional paths are defined in the state model, it is not necessary to report any state transition(s) until a terminal state is reached at which time each transition used to reach that state is reported. Table 2 State Transition Table\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.3  Services\n\n7.3.1  Services are functions or methods that may be provided by either the equipment or the host. A service message may be either a request message, which always requires a response, or a notification message that does not require a response.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.3.2  Service Message Description\n\n7.3.2.1  A service message description table defines the parameters used in a service, as shown in the following table:  \nTable 3  Service Message Description Table  \n#1  Type can be either “N” $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ Notification or “R” $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } = \\mathbf { \\Sigma }$ Request & Response.  \n7.3.2.2  Notification type messages are initiated by the service provider (e.g., the equipment) and the provider does not expect to get a response from the service user. Request messages are initiated by a service user (e.g., the host). Request messages ask for data or an activity from the provider. Request messages expect a specific response message (no presumption on the message content).\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.3.3  Service Message Parameter Definition\n\n7.3.3.1  A service parameter dictionary table defines the description, range, and type for parameters used by services, as shown in the following table:\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # Table 4  Service Message Parameter Definition Table\n\n#1  A row is provided in the table for each parameter used on a service.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.3.4  Service Message Definition\n\n7.3.4.1  A service message description table defines the parameters used in a service message. It also describes each message and its cause/effect to the equipment. The columns labeled Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf link the parameters to the direction of the message.  \n7.3.4.2  The columns labeled Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf link the parameters to the direction of the message. The message sent by the initiator is called the “Request”. The receiver terms this message the “Indication”. The receiver may then send a “Response”, which the original sender terms the “Confirmation”.  \n7.3.4.3  The following codes appear in the Req/Ind and Rsp/Conf columns and are used in the definition of the parameters (e.g., how each parameter is used in each direction):\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 7.4  Alarm Requirements Definition\n\n7.4.1  An alarm requirements definition table defines the specific set of alarms required by CMS. The table is divided up by equipment configuration, and then by alarm. The danger and affected columns are marked with “X” characters to show each alarm and its possible impact to operators, equipment, and material. The table format is shown in the following example:\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 8  Overview\n\n8.1  CMS defines the behavior, data, and services required for equipment supporting automated carrier transfer. This document provides a standard interface for host/equipment communications regarding the transfer of carriers. The standardized carrier transfer host interface includes not only transfers to and from the external load ports, but also transfers to and from the internal buffer positions on internal buffer type equipment.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 8.2  Single Connection Requirement\n\n8.2.1  The expectation of the production equipment supplier is that this standard be implemented in conjunction with the GEM interface to their production equipment and without the use of a separate communication connection.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9  Load Port\n\n9.1  A load port (port) is used by the factory to load and unload carriers to and from production equipment. A load port may be used as an input load port, an output load port, or as an input/output load port, depending upon equipment type, configuration and/or factory practices. This classification may be fixed or it may be programmable by the user. A load port is generally designed to handle one specific carrier type, such as substrate cassettes, leadframe magazines, SMIF pods, or FOUPs.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.2  Load Port Numbering\n\n9.2.1  The load port number shall be assigned incrementally from the bottom left to bottom right, then top left to top right when facing the front of the equipment. The load port numbering requirement is to provide a common reference base to external entities, such as humans.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.3  Carrier Slot Numbering\n\n9.3.1  The slot numbers for a carrier shall be assigned incrementally from the bottom, starting with “1.”  \n9.4  Load Port Resource Sharing  \n9.4.1  A model of a load port must account for any mechanical assemblies that are either active during carrier transfer or are capable of interacting with the transfer. The load port is responsible for such mechanisms when the load port is in the TRANSFER READY state. If these mechanisms are shared with other load ports, then the sharing must be coordinated.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.5  Load Port Transfer State Model\n\n9.5.1  The purpose of the Load Port Transfer State Model is to define the host view of a carrier transfer, which includes the host interactions with the equipment necessary to transfer carriers to and from equipment load ports. Each load port on the equipment shall maintain an independent instance of this state model.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.5.2  Load Port Transfer State Model Diagram\n\n9.5.2.1  Figure 1 is the diagram for the Load Port Transfer State Model.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.5.3  Load Port Transfer State Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.5.3  Load Port Transfer State Definitions\n\nContent: 9.5.3.1 LOAD PORT TRANSFER — The super state for the IN SERVICE and OUT OF SERVICE states. 9.5.3.2 OUT OF SERVICE — Transfer to/from this load port is disabled. A transition to IN SERVICE is required to continue using this load port for transfers. 9.5.3.3 IN SERVICE — Transfer to/from this load port is enabled. A transition to OUT OF SERVICE disables the load port for transfer use. 9.5.3.4 TRANSFER READY — A sub-state of IN SERVICE. The load port is available for carrier transfer. The transfer can either be manual or automated, and can be a load or an unload. This state contains two sub-states, which are used depending on whether or not a carrier is present on the load port (READY TO LOAD and READY TO UNLOAD). 9.5.3.5 READY TO LOAD — A sub-state of TRANSFER READY. When transitioning to the TRANSFER READY state, if a carrier is not present on the specified load port, this is the active sub-state. In this state, the load port is available to be loaded with an external carrier, or with a carrier that is currently\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.5.3  Load Port Transfer State Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 9.5.3  Load Port Transfer State Definitions\n\nContent: located inside the equipment (i.e. internal buffer). 9.5.3.6 READY TO UNLOAD — A sub-state of TRANSFER READY. When transitioning to the TRANSFER READY state, if a carrier is present on the specified load port, this is the active sub-state. In this state, the load port is available for unloading of a carrier from the loadport to material handling equipment. When the load port is being used by the equipment, the state shall transition to TRANSFER BLOCKED. 9.5.3.7 TRANSFER BLOCKED — The carrier transfer state is neither READY TO LOAD nor READY TO UNLOAD. Because of load port related activity being performed, transfer is not available to/from this load port at this time.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10  Carrier Object\n\n10.1  Information about a carrier is encapsulated as an object. This allows the host to exchange information with the equipment about one or more specific carriers using services defined in SEMI E39, Object Services Standard. A carrier has properties (attributes) that are defined in Table 6, Carrier Attribute Definition.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.2  Object Instantiation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.2  Object Instantiation\n\nContent: 10.2.1 The carrier object is a software representation of the carrier in the equipment. Under normal circumstances this object is instantiated by the equipment when the host uses the Bind or Carrier Notification service or when the equipment successfully reads the carrierID from the carrier. A carrier object is instantiated by carrierID read only if there are no currently existing objects with the carrierID just read. A carrier object can also be instantiated by either the ProceedWithCarrier or CancelCarrier Services on an NOT ASSOCIATED port. (This implies a failed carrierID read event.) The ContentMap attribute will be an empty list (a list of zero) when the instantiation is done by CarrierID read. The SlotMap attribute should be a list consisting of all slots enumerated as “UNDEFINED” when the carrier object is instantiated by CarrierID read. 10.2.2 From the host point of view, an object is instantiated if the host is able to query the equipment about that object, it's current state, and other attributes. Once instantiated,\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.2  Object Instantiation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.2  Object Instantiation\n\nContent: the object is considered destroyed (no longer instantiated) if the response to such queries is “unknown object”. 10.2.3 Summary of carrier object instantiation: 1. Bind or Carrier Notification or CarrierReCreate (with PropertiesList) service; 2. CarrierID read with no currently existing carrier objects having the carrierID just read; and 3. ProceedWithCarrier or CancelCarrier Service on an NOT ASSOCIATED port with a carrier. 10.2.4 Carrier Object Identifier (ObjID) 10.2.4.1 The purpose of an Object Identifier is to allow references to an object within the system. The object identifier is created when an object is instantiated and should be unchanged or persistent until the end of the object lifecycle. The Object Identifier shall be unique at the equipment during lifecycle of the object. The Carrier ID is the Carrier Object Identifier. The equipment is responsible for ensuring uniqueness of the Carrier ID prior to instantiation by the bind service.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.2.5  Carrier Object Destruction\n\n10.2.5.1  Normally, the Carrier Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when the carrier is unloaded from the equipment.  Abnormally, the Carrier Object reaches the end of its lifecycle when a CancelBind or CancelCarrierNotification service is executed prior to the carrier being loaded, or when an equipment based carrier verification fails following carrier instantiation by the bind service.  \n10.2.5.2  Summary of carrier object destruction:  \n1. A carrier is unloaded from the equipment;\n2. A CancelBind or CancelCarrierNotification service is received;\n3. An equipment based CarrierID verification fails after a carrier object was previously instantiated with a “Bind”\nservice (Equipment initiated CancelBind); and\n4. The host or operator has issued a CarrierReCreate service.  \n10.3  Carrier Attribute Definitions  \n10.3.1  The following table contains the attributes that are of importance to the host and/or the equipment in order to manage the history and the reports about the carrier object.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.2  REQD Column\n\n10.3.2.1  All attributes in the following table are required to be associated with the carrier object and are always maintained and updated by the equipment (for example, if the equipment has a waferID reader, the equipment can determine the ContentMap).\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.3  ACCESS Column\n\n10.3.3.1  Even though a value may be marked as RO (read only), the initial value for the attribute may be provided by the host when attached to either the Bind or ProceedWithCarrier services.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.4  Carrier Attribute Definition Table\n\nTable 6  Carrier Attribute Definition  \nNOT EMPTY is included to indicate presence for equipment that is only able to detect substrate presence but not correct positioning of the ubstrate slot. For equipment that can detect incorrect positioning such as cross-slotted or double slotted, NOT EMPTY may not be applicable.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.5  Rules for Carrier Attributes (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.5  Rules for Carrier Attributes\n\nContent: The equipment shall change object attributes, Capacity, ContentMap, SlotMap, Substrate count and Usage, provided by the host. All other attributes, such as LocationID, shall be set and maintained by the equipment. The attributes, Capacity, ContentMap, Substrate count and Usage, shall be provided with Bind, CarrierNotification, or ProceedWithCarrier service before or when SlotMap is provided. The SlotMap shall be provided with Bind, CarrierNotification, or ProceedWithCarrier to verify CarrierID, when the SlotMap verification is equipment based. And it shall not be provided when the SlotMap verification is host based. Carrier properties may be provided before the carrier arrives as part of the Bind service and should be retained until either a CancelBind service is received or the carrier is removed. • Carrier properties may also be provided by the ProceedWithCarrier service. The carrier properties that are provided by the ProceedWithCarrier service may differ based whether or not the object is instantiated by the\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.5  Rules for Carrier Attributes (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.5  Rules for Carrier Attributes\n\nContent: service. • Carrier properties that are required shall be actively updated by the equipment.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.6  Carrier Location\n\n10.3.6.1  A carrier location, signified by LocationID, is used for tracking carriers as they move through the equipment. A carrier location is any physical area that is capable of holding a carrier. It is not intended to represent entire mechanisms, which may have a variety of other properties of interest, but only that portion where a Carrier may rest.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.3.7  Carrier Location Examples\n\n10.3.7.1  Carrier Locations include load port locations, substrate port locations, internal buffer locations, as well as grippers, conveyors, and elevators that are used internally for moving the carrier from one fixed location to another.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.4  Carrier Location Naming\n\n10.4.1  Carrier locations shall be assigned a unique name. Information about the carrier location can be ob-tained by querying the CarrierObject for the LocationID or by asking the equipment for the CarrierLocation-Matrix. The text form of the LocationID shall be descriptive of the location. For example, LocationID form for load port load/unload location might be “LPn”, where “n” equal is equal to the load port number (the load port number is determined through the numbering rule in $\\ P 9 . 1 )$ . The LocationID form for the FIMS port location might be “FIMSn”. The LocationID form for a buffer location might be “BUFn”.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.5  Load Port Carrier Locations\n\n10.5.1  For fixed buffer equipment configured to handle FOUPs, a Load Port has two different Carrier Locations. One represents the place where a Carrier is delivered and picked up, while the other represents the place where the Carrier is docked and can be opened.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.6  Carriers Between Locations\n\n10.6.1  When the carrier is traveling from one location to another, the location attribute remains equal to the source location until the carrier movement is complete and the carrier is resting at the new carrier location (the destination location).\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.6.2  Usage\n\n10.6.2.1  The Usage parameter indicates the type of substrate the carrier contains.  All Usage values are equipment specific values.  Some internal buffer equipment manages carriers by establishing logical partitions.  This type of equipment shall use the Usage parameter to determine which logical partition where the carrier is held.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.6.3  SubstrateCount\n\n10.6.3.1  The SubstrateCount parameter can be sent to the equipment by the host in either the Bind service or the ProceedWithCarrier service. However the equipment shall update this parameter based on the results of the read slot map operation. Furthermore, the equipment shall update the parameter based on it’s own actions of adding and removing a substrate to and from a carrier. If the equipment does not know the value of SubstrateCount prior to instantiation, the equipment shall instantiate the carrier object with the value of null for SubstrateCount.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.6.4  Lot information for ContentMap\n\n10.6.4.1  Lot is defined in SEMI E90 as a group of one or more substrates of the same type.  It is organized external to the equipment.  The Lot ID is the identifier of this group. If the equipment is informed of the Lot ID to which a substrate belongs, the equipment must maintain this information.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.6.5  Carrier Accessing Status\n\n10.6.5.1  The CarrierAccessingStatus is used by the host to know whether or not the carrier owned by the equipment can be moved out.  If the carrier is within the internal buffer equipment, this status may be used by the host to issue CarrierOut service.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7  Carrier State Model\n\n10.7.1  The purpose of the Carrier State Model is to define the host’s view of a carrier. The equipment shall maintain a separate and independent state model for each carrier in/at the equipment.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: 0.7.3.1 CARRIER — The CARRIER state has three ANDed (orthogonal) states: CARRIER ID STATUS, CARRIER SLOT MAP STATUS and CARRIER ACCESSING STATUS. 10.7.3.2 CARRIER ACCESSING STATUS — This is a substate of CARRIER and indicates the current accessing status of the carrier. It has four substates, NOT ACCESSED, IN ACCESS, CARRIER COMPLETE, and CARRIER STOPPED. The initial default entry substate is NOT ACCESSED. 10.7.3.2.1 NOT ACCESSED — This is a substate of CARRIER ACCESSING STATUS and is active when access by the equipment to the carrier has not been started. The carrier can be moved out. 10.7.3.2.2 IN ACCESS — This is a substate of CARRIER ACCESSING STATUS and is active when access by the equipment to the carrier has been started but has not been finished, and the carrier should not be moved out. 10.7.3.2.3 CARRIER COMPLETE — This is a substate of CARRIER ACCESSING STATUS and is active when the access by the equipment to the carrier has been finished, and the carrier should be moved out. This is a final state. 10.7.3.2.4\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: CARRIER STOPPED — This is a substate of CARRIER ACCESSING STATUS and is active when the access by the equipment to the carrier has been stopped abnormally, and the carrier should be moved out. This is a final state. 10.7.3.3 CARRIER ID STATUS — This is a substate of CARRIER and indicates the current status of the carrier with respect to its identifier. It has four substates, ID NOT READ, WAITING FOR HOST, ID VERIFICATION FAILED, ID VERIFICATION OK. The initial substate is conditional based on information the equipment has about the carrier. When the carrierID is provided by the Bind or the Carrier Notification service, the carrier object shall be instantiated in the ID NOT READ substate. When the carrierID is provided by the carrier ID reader, the carrier shall be instantiated in the WAITING FOR HOST substate. When the Carrier is instantiated by the ProceedWithCarrier service, the carrier shall be instantiated in the ID VERIFICATION OK substate. Finally when the carrier is instantiated by the CancelCarrier service, the\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: carrier will be instantiated in the ID VERIFICATION FAILED substate. 10.7.3.3.1 ID NOT READ — This is a substate of CARRIER ID STATUS. This state is active whenever the CarrierID has not been read by the equipment. 10.7.3.3.2 ID VERIFICATION FAILED — This is a substate of CARRIER ID STATUS and is active when the carrierID has failed verification by the host following the CancelCarrier service. This is a final state. 10.7.3.3.3 ID VERIFICATION OK — This is a substate of CARRIER ID STATUS and is active as soon as the CarrierID has been accepted. The ID is determined to be accepted by either successful verification by the equipment or the host, or by bypassing ID read because a carrier ID reader is not available and the BypassReadID variable is set to true. This is a final state. 10.7.3.3.4 WAITING FOR HOST — This is a substate of CARRIER ID STATUS and is active during the period of time when the carrierID has been read by the equipment successfully or unsuccessfully and has not yet been verified by the host. 10.7.3.4 CARRIER\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: SLOT MAP STATUS — This is a substate of CARRIER and indicates the current status of the carrier with respect to its slot map. It has four substates, SLOT MAP NOT READ, WAITING FOR HOST, SLOT MAP VERIFICATION FAILED, SLOT MAP VERIFICATION OK. The initial default entry sub-state is SLOT MAP NOT READ. 10.7.3.4.1 SLOT MAP NOT READ — This is a substate of CARRIER SLOT MAP STATUS and is the default entry state. It is active when the Carrier is first loaded at the equipment until the Slot Map has been read successfully by the equipment at the Substrate Port. 10.7.3.4.2 SLOT MAP VERIFICATION FAIL — This is a substate of CARRIER SLOT MAP STATUS and is active when the Slot Map has been read by the equipment and has failed verification by the host. This is a final state. 10.7.3.4.3 SLOT MAP VERIFICATION OK — This is a substate of CARRIER SLOT MAP STATUS and is active as soon as the slot map has been verified. This is a final state. 10.7.3.4.4 WAITING FOR HOST — This is a substate of CARRIER SLOT MAP STATUS and is active when the\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.3  Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: equipment is waiting for input from the host.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.4  Carrier State Transition Table\n\n10.7.4.1  Table 7 indicates the triggers and the expected behavior of the instantiated carrier object.  \nTable 7  Carrier State Transition Definition  \n#1  Only one collection event report is required when entering the Carrier State Model (instantiating a carrier object).  This event report shall include the entry state of the all the substates of Carrier State Model, (including CARRIER ID STATUS substate and the CARRIER SLOT MAP STATUS substate).\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.5  Slot Map Read Details (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.5  Slot Map Read Details\n\nContent: 0.7.5.1 The Slot Map shall be read on all production equipment prior to removal of substrates from the carrier. 10.7.6 Carrier Read Failure — A carrier read failure occurs when the carrier ID reader is present, in service, and reports that it is unable to read the ID of a carrier. This represents a transient random failure rather than a steady condition. 10.7.7 Bypass Read $I D - \\mathbf { A }$ carrier ID reader may be unavailable: either out of service, not installed, or otherwise malfunctioning and unable to execute a read operation. This represents a steady condition that often is known in advance. The equipment shall provide a user-configurable variable BypassReadID used to bypass verification of the carrier ID when the carrier ID reader is unavailable or not installed and the loadport is ASSOCIATED. BypassReadID is not used to bypass the carrier ID reader. In this case, the carrier object is instantiated in the ID NOT READ state, and when the carrier is received, the state model transitions to either WAITING FOR HOST or\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.5  Slot Map Read Details (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 10.7.5  Slot Map Read Details\n\nContent: ID VERIFICATION OK, depending upon whether BypassReadID is FALSE (the default value) or TRUE. When TRUE, then the Carrier ID received in the Bind is used automatically. Otherwise, the carrier transitions to WAITING FOR HOST and waits for the host to send a ProceedWithCarrier. The ID used will be the ID included with the ProceedWithCarrier.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 11.1  Access Mode State Model\n\n11.1.1  The Access Mode State Model defines the host view of equipment access mode, as well as the host interactions with the equipment necessary to switch the access mode. Each Load Port has its own Access Mode State Model. There are two access mode states: MANUAL and AUTO. These are defined in $\\ P 1 1 . 3 . 3$ .  \n11.1.2  The access mode for a load port may be switched at anytime by the host or the operator, except when the Load Port Reservation State Model for that Load Port is in the RESERVED state or during carrier transfer. Carrier transfer boundaries, for determining when access mode may be changed, are designated by Table 8, Carrier Transfer Boundaries.  \nTable 8  Carrier Transfer Boundaries\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 11.2  Manual Carrier Transfer Confirmation Trigger\n\n11.2.1  For a manual transfer completion confirmation, the production equipment supplier must implement a software or hardware mechanism for an operator to inform the equipment that the carrier transfer is complete.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 11.3  Access Mode Initial Value\n\n11.3.1  Also, when equipment re-initialization occurs, the access mode(s) must be remembered, and used as the initial value when initializing. Since the access mode is remembered through re-initializations, the initial value that is used the very first time the software is ever loaded is not important. The equipment supplier is free to set this default value.  \n11.3.2  Access Mode State Model Diagram\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 11.3.3  Access Mode State Definitions\n\n11.3.3.1  ACCESS MODE — The parent state for the MANUAL and AUTO sub-states.  \n11.3.3.2  MANUAL — A sub-state of ACCESS MODE. When the production equipment or specified load port is in this mode, only manual (non-AMHS) carrier transfers are allowed. The production equipment shall have the capability of generating an alarm if an automated (AMHS) delivery is attempted.  If a ChangeAccess service with the value of MANUAL is received in this state, the equipment shall accept the service and no event is sent for this action.  \n11.3.3.3  AUTO — A sub-state of ACCESS MODE. When the production equipment or specified load ports are in this mode, only automated (AMHS) carrier transfers are allowed. The production equipment shall have the capability of generating an alarm if a manual delivery is attempted.  If a ChangeAccess service with the value of AUTO is received in this state, the equipment shall accept the service and no event is sent for this action.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 11.3.4  Access Mode State Transition Table\n\n11.3.4.1  Table 9 defines the transitions for the Access Mode State Model.  \nTable 9  Access Mode State Transition Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12  Reservation State Model (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12  Reservation State Model\n\nContent: 12.1 The purpose of the Reservation State Model is to define the host view of future activity at a specific load port. 12.1.1 In the Reservation State Model, the ReserveAtPort and CancelReservationAtPort services enable th following items: 1. They enable the host to inform the equipment of a future carrier delivery without specifying the carrier ID and at the same time allow host based verification. (Equipment based verification is enabled via the Load Port/Carrier Association State Model, the Bind service, and the Carrier Notification service detailed in $\\ S 1 3$ , $\\ P 1 5 . 4 . 2$ and $\\ P 1 5 . 4 . 1 1$ of SEMI E87.) 2. They enable the equipment to send a state change event to the host if the operator (either local or remote) informs the equipment of a future carrier delivery to a port without specifying the carrier ID. Thus the host knows that the operator expects to use that port for something the host did not request for AMHS based delivery. 3. They enable internal buffer equipment to inform the host that it is\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12  Reservation State Model (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12  Reservation State Model\n\nContent: physically initiating a carrier out operation (this carrier has a known or specified ID) and that no AMHS delivery should be scheduled. 4. The Bind and CancelBind services also trigger changes in the Load Port Reservation State Model. If the Load Port Reservation state model is in the NOT RESERVED state, the Bind service triggers a transition to the RESERVED state. If the Load Port Reservation is in the RESERVED State, the CancelBind service triggers a transition to NOT RESERVED. 12.1.2 For internal buffer equipment, the Reservation State Model, the ReserveAtPort service, the CancelReservationAtPort service, and all other associated functionality are necessary for fundamental compliance to this standard. 12.1.3 For fixed buffer equipment, the Reservation State Model, the ReserveAtPort service, the CancelReserveAtPort service, and all other associated functionality is a user option and not necessary for fundamental compliance. 12.1.4 For equipment implementing the reservation state model, the equipment shall provide a load port\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12  Reservation State Model (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12  Reservation State Model\n\nContent: reservation state model for each load port.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12.2  Reservation Visible Signal\n\n12.2.1  When a port reservation has taken place, the equipment shall display a visible signal indicating that the designated load port is in the Reserved State.  Examples of visible signals for the associated load port are: Blinking LEDs, flags, color indicators, or other methods that allow easy recognition that the load port is reserved; proximity to or location on the load port is recommended.  The visible signal shall remain present as long as the load port state remains RESERVED.  When the state changes to NOT RESERVED the visible indicator shall cease.  This capability is not required for fundamental compliance to CMS.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12.4  Load Port Reservation State Definitions\n\n12.4.1  LOAD PORT RESERVATION — The super state of the substates NOT RESERVED and RESERVED.  \n12.4.2  NOT RESERVED — A substate of LOAD PORT RESERVATION, this state is active when there is no reservation existing at the load port.  \n12.4.3  RESERVED — A substate of LOADPORT RESERVATION, this state is active when there is a reservation for future activity at the load port. When in this state, the access mode for a load port may not be changed.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 12.6  Relation of Reservation to Association\n\n12.6.1  The following figure indicates the relationship of Association to Reservation.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 13  Load Port/Carrier Association State Model\n\n13.1  The purpose of the Carrier Association State Model is to define the host view of carrier to load port association of the production equipment, as well as the host interactions with the production equipment necessary to associate a carrier to load port, and to perform equipment based carrier verification. Each load port shall maintain an independent instance of the Carrier Association State Model. Each instance of this state model must not influence the state of the same state model for a different load port.  \n13.1.1  This state model provides the ability to perform carrierID verification with two different methods. If the CarrierID is provided before the equipment reads the CarrierID, the CarrierID that becomes associated with the load port can be used later for equipment based carrier verification. If the association happens by CarrierID read (not by a service execution), then the production equipment shall report the CarrierID information in a data collection event.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 13.2.1  Load Port/Carrier Association State Definitions\n\n13.2.1.1  LOAD PORT/CARRIER ASSOCIATION — The parent state of the NOT ASSOCIATED and ASSOCIATED sub-states.  \n13.2.1.2  NOT ASSOCIATED — A sub-state of LOAD PORT/CARRIER ASSOCIATION. There is no carrier association present for this load port.  \n13.2.1.3  ASSOCIATED — A sub-state of LOAD PORT/CARRIER ASSOCIATION. A CarrierID has been associated with this load port. The load port is not available for a new carrier association.  \n13.2.2  Load Port/Carrier Association State Transition Table  \n13.2.2.1  Table 11 defines the transitions of the Load Port/Carrier Association State Model.  \nTable 11  Load Port/Carrier Association State Transition Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 14  Verification\n\n14.1  Verification is the operation of comparing an actual value with an expected value. Verification may be performed by either the host or the equipment, depending upon whether the host is using the Bind service or not.  \n14.1.1  If the host provides the expected value before the actual value is obtained by the production equipment, then the production equipment shall perform the verification.  \n14.1.2  If the host does not provide the expected value, using the Bind service, before the actual value is read, then the production equipment shall provide to the host, the information necessary for host based verification.  \n14.1.3  There are two values that are defined by Carrier Management that require verification: Carrier ID and Carrier Slot Map.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 14.2  CarrierID Verification\n\n14.2.1  Table 12 defines the methods for verifying the Carrier ID.  \nTable 12  Carrier ID Verification Methods\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 14.3  Slot Map Verification\n\n14.3.1  Table 13 defines the methods for verification of the Carrier Slot Map. Some user’s factory operations may not require strict management of the slot map. In this case the user may use the host based verification method.  \nTable 13  Slot Map Verification Methods  \n14.4  This table clarifies the relation of the reservation and verification to the related services.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 15  Carrier Release Control (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 15  Carrier Release Control\n\nContent: 15.1 For both fixed buffer and internal buffer equipment, where Carrier Read/Write technology is used, the carrier must remain at the write position where the tag may be accurately written on until the Host has completed all of its read and write operations. For this purpose, a variable that affects the equipment releasing a carrier is defined. 15.2 Carrier Hold Trigger — Both fixed buffer equipment and internal buffer equipment shall allow the user to select a trigger to release the carrier when reading/writing is complete. Carrier release does not mean the equipment must move the carrier from the location it currently occupies, only that it is permissible to do so. 15.2.1 CarrierHold Trigger set to Host Release — If the Carrier Hold trigger is set to Host Release, both fixed buffer and internal buffer equipment shall hold the carrier at the write position until the CarrierRelease service is received. 15.2.2 CarrierHold Trigger set to Equipment Release — If the Carrier Hold trigger is set to Equipment Release, the equipment\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 15  Carrier Release Control (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 15  Carrier Release Control\n\nContent: shall release the carrier based on the Carrier Object state model transition to CARRIER COMPLETE or CARRIER STOPPED. 15.3 For fixed load port equipment in AUTO access mode, it may be desirable to leave a completed carrier clamped, locked, or at the docked position until the AMHS arrives to pick it up. This reduces the chance that an operator may remove it. For this purpose, a variable that affects UnClamp Control is provided to allow the user to select the desired behavior. When the equipment finishes with a carrier, the Carrier State transitions from ACCESSING to CARRIER COMPLETE (normal) or CARRIER STOPPED (abnormal) and the equipment sends either the CarrierComplete event (normal) or the CarrierStopped event (abnormal). If the carrier has a door, the door shall be closed by this point. 15.4 Fixed buffer equipment shall allow the user to select a trigger to unclamp the carrier based on AMHS arrival at the equipment. If the access mode is MANUAL, the unclamp control trigger has no effect. 15.4.1 UnclampControl trigger set to\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 15  Carrier Release Control (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 15  Carrier Release Control\n\nContent: CARRIERCOMPLETE/CARRIERSTOPPED Triggered Unclamp The equipment automatically unclamps the carrier when the Carrier Status transitions to CARRIERCOMPLETE or CARRIERSTOPPED. 15.4.2 UnclampControl trigger set to AMHS Triggered Unclamp — The equipment behavior depends upon the Load Port Access State. If the Loadport Access State is AUTO, the carrier remains clamped, locked, or at the docked position (it will remain at the docked position only if that is the only position on which the carrier can be clamped) until AMHS has arrived. The AMHS arrives and begins a PIO unload sequence. The carrier must be at or moved to the pickup position and any additional clamp mechanisms must be released by the appropriate point of the sequence. NOTE 2: It may be necessary to adjust timeouts for the AMHS to allow a few more seconds to move the carrier into the pickup position.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16  Services\n\n16.1  The purpose of this section is to define the message services required to support CMS functionality.  \n16.1.1  This message service definition has four parts:  \nA service description table.\nA service parameter table.\nA service parameter value table that specifies the type and range of the parameters.\nA service state mapping table that defines the states in which each service is valid.  \n16.2  Service Message Description  \n16.2.1  There are two types of services:  \n• An initial message and response between the service user and the service provider.\n• A notification message from the service provider to the service user that does not require a response.  \n16.2.2  The “TYPE” column in the following table is used to indicate whether the service consists of a request/response message pair, “R”, or a single notification message, “N”.  \nTable 15  Service Message Description\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.3  Service Message Parameter Definition\n\n16.3.1  The following is a list of required parameters used in conjunction with service messages.  \nTable 16  Service Message Parameter Definition  \n16.3.2  The “Acknowledge, request will be performed with completion signaled by a later event” response to a service, may apply to services listed in the table below.  If this does apply, the supplier must document the event that signals completion.  Any service not included in Table 17 shall respond with “Acknowledge, command has been performed.”  \n16.3.2.1  Events that may signal completion are listed in Table 17.\nTable 17  Deferred Completion Events\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4  Service Message Definitions\n\n16.4.1  The following tables specify the allowable/required parameters for each service. The column marked “REQ/IND” specifies which parameters are required to be supported for CMS compliance (see $\\ P [ 7 . 3 . 4 . 3 )$ .\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.2  Bind\n\n16.4.2.1  The Bind service is used to associate a CarrierID with a load port. The Bind can contain a PropertiesList of carrier object attributes that are supplied by the host. A carrier object is instantiated when this service is used successfully.  The Bind service will be rejected if the carrier specified has already been instantiated through the Bind or CarrierNotification service, or a carrierID read. The Bind service also triggers a transition in the Load Port Reservation state model from NOT RESERVED to RESERVED.  \nTable 18  Bind Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.3  CancelAllCarrierOut\n\n16.4.3.1  The CancelAllCarrierOut service is sent to internal buffer production equipment to cancel all CarrierOut services in queue.  \nTable 19  CancelAllCarrierOut Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.4  CancelBind\n\n16.4.4.1  The CancelBind request is used to cancel the association between a port and a Carrier ID. The carrier object is destroyed when this service is used successfully. The CancelBind service also triggers a transition in the Load Port Reservation state model from RESERVED to NOT RESERVED.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.5  CancelCarrier\n\n16.4.5.1  The CancelCarrier request is used to stop a carrier. If the carrier is at a load port, then it shall be returned to the load/unload location of the load port and made ready for unload. If the carrier is at an internal location the carrier will return to an internal buffer location. A subsequent CarrierOut request is required for the production equipment to move the carrier to the external load port. The production equipment shall reject this service if issued after substrates have been removed for processing.  \nTable 21  CancelCarrier Service Parameters\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.6  CancelCarrierAtPort\n\n16.4.6.1  CancelCarrierAtPort is used to abort any carrier at a designated port. This service can be used when the carrierID of the carrier at the designated port is unknown.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.7  CancelCarrierNotification\n\n16.4.7.1  The CancelCarrierNotification is used by the host to request the equipment cancel a previous CarrierNotification service.  This service shall cause the equipment to destroy the carrier object specified.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.8  CancelCarrierOut\n\n16.4.8.1  The CancelCarrierOut service is sent to internal buffer production equipment to cancel a queued CarrierOut.  \nTable 24  CancelCarrierOut Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.9  CancelReservationAtPort\n\n16.4.9.1  The CancelReservationAtPort service is sent by the host to cancel a reservation at the load port.  The load port will enter the UNRESERVED State after receiving this service.  A Port reserved by the physical initiation of a carrier out operation may not be cancelled by this service.  \nTable 25  CancelReservationAtPort Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.10  CarrierIn\n\n16.4.10.1  The CarrierIn service is only used to request the internal buffer equipment internalize a carrier that has been moved to the load port via a previous CarrierOut service. When using host based verification, the production equipment shall move the carrier in to the internal buffer for the first time after receiving the ProceedWithCarrier request. If the CarrierIn service is received by the production equipment without previously having received a CarrierOut service for the carrier, the service will be refused.  \nTable 26  CarrierIn Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.11  CarrierNotification\n\n16.4.11.1  The Carrier Notification service is used by the host to inform the equipment that a Carrier with the ID specified will be arriving at the equipment.  The load port is not specified; therefore no carrier to load port association takes place.  A carrier object with the ObjID equal to the carrierID specified in the service is instantiated. “The CarrierNotification service will be rejected if the carrier specified has already been instantiated through the Bind or CarrierNotification service, or a carrierID read.  \nTable 27  CarrierNotification Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.12  CarrierOut\n\n16.4.12.1  The CarrierOut service is sent to internal buffer production equipment, to request that the equipment move the specified carrier to a load port, as soon as the carrier is completed. When the CarrierOut service is started, the destination load port state becomes TRANSFER BLOCKED, and the load port’s association state becomes ASSOCIATED.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.12.2  CarrierOut Queuing\n\n16.4.12.2.1  This service request can be queued by the production equipment. The production equipment is required to support a queue of n size, where n is equal to the sum of the number of internal buffer locations and the number of internal FIMS ports. The order of the queue is FIFO for each load port. If the load port is not specified in service request, the equipment chooses which load port queue to place the CarrierOut service. The queued service does not take effect until the current substrate handling action is complete (i.e., filling, emptying of the carrier) and the load port is in the NOT ASSOCIATED state. When a CarrierOut service is queued and the production equipment load port is currently in the TRANSFER BLOCKED state, the production equipment shall keep the load port in the TRANSFER BLOCKED state. Then, after the port is cleared, the CarrierOut service shall begin.  \nTable 28  CarrierOut Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.13  CarrierRelease\n\n16.4.13.1  CarrierRelease request is used to tell the equipment that the carrier is ready to be moved away from the read or write position.  Equipment shall deny the request if PortID and CarrierID are mismatched.  \nTable 29  CarrierRelease Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.14  CarrierReCreate (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.14  CarrierReCreate\n\nContent: 16.4.14.1 CarrierReCreate request is used to re-create the carrier object specified by the service. This will allow a repeated introduction of the same carrier on the loadport. After the service is issued, the equipment shall treat the carrier occupying the respective loadport identically to one that was physically removed and replaced, deleting the original carrier and then re-instantiating it. If no PropertiesList is provided with the service, then the host verification scenarios for re-instantiating the carrier object shall be followed. For example, the carrier ID would be re-read (at which point Carrier State transition #3, (no state) to Waiting for Host occurs) and subsequently verified by host, followed by slot map re-read and verification by host. Alternatively, if PropertiesList is provided with this service, then the equipment shall follow the equipment based verification steps. For example, the carrier object is reinstantiated with the CarrierID (and possibly content/slot map) information provided within the\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.14  CarrierReCreate (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.14  CarrierReCreate\n\nContent: CarrierReCreate Service. In this equipment based verification scenario, the equipment is responsible for verifying the contents of the carrier against the received information. If the equipment supports other SEMI standards (i.e.- SEMI E40/E90/E94), then from the perspective of those standards, when CarrierReCreate service is received, the scenario would resemble that of a carrier being removed and a new carrier placed. The service shall be accepted only if the load port is in the “Ready to Unload” state. Table 30 CarrierReCreate Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.15  CarrierTagReadData\n\n16.4.15.1  CarrierTagReadData is used to request a block of data from the carrier ID tag.  Equipment shall deny the request if LocationID and CarrierID are mismatched.  \nTable 31  CarrierTagReadData Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.16  CarrierTagWriteData\n\n16.4.16.1  CarrierTagWriteData is used to request that a block of data be written to the carrier ID tag.  Equipment shall deny the request if LocationID and CarrierID are mismatched.  \nTable 32  CarrierTagWriteData Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.17  ChangeAccess\n\n16.4.17.1  The ChangeAccess message requests a change of access mode for the load ports specified in the PortList.  \nTable 33  ChangeAccess Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.18  ChangeServiceStatus\n\n16.4.18.1  The ChangeServiceStatus service is used to request the production equipment change a load port service state.  \nTable 34  ChangeServiceStatus Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.19  ProceedWithCarrier\n\n16.4.19.1  The ProceedWithCarrier service is sent by the host to indicate that the carrier operations may continue. When using host based verification it is used by the host to indicate to the production equipment that the verification of Carrier ID and/or the Carrier Slot Map is correct. For successful production equipment based verification the production equipment shall not require this message before proceeding with the carrier. For failed production equipment based verification the production equipment shall require either a CancelCarrier or ProceedWithCarrier service.  \n16.4.19.2  Using Table 34, for the Host based CarrierID verification case, the ProceedWithCarrier service sent by the host after the first carrier ID read is referred to as ProceedWithCarrier #1, the ProceedWithCarrier service sent after slot map read is referred to as ProceedWithCarrier #2.  \nTable 35  ProceedWithCarrier Service Parameter Definition\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 16.4.20  ReserveAtPort\n\n16.4.20.1  The ReserveAtPort service is sent by the host to indicate future activity at the load port.  This allows for reserving the port but doing host based ID verification.  The load port will enter the RESERVED State after receiving this service.  The equipment shall move a carrier to a reserved load port.  \nTable 36  ReserveAtPort Service Parameter Definitions\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 17  Carrier Tag Read/Write (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 17  Carrier Tag Read/Write\n\nContent: 17.1 Some technologies allow data to be stored on a carrier ID tag where it can be subsequently read and/or modified. In this case, it is the host that specifies when this data is written and read, because the equipment has no knowledge of the contents of the data. The read operations shall be performed only when the carrier is at the read position. The write operations shall be performed only when the carrier is at the write position. NOTE: The read and write positions may be the same position. The host shall be able to both read and write whenever CarrierHold switch is set to Host Release and the carrier is at the respective read or write position. Once the host has completed all of its read and write operations for that carrier, then the host sends the CarrierRelease request to the equipment. In all cases, the CarrierAccessingStatus state shall be set to either CARRIER COMPLETE or CARRIER STOPPED before the carrier may be undocked. The CarrierRelease service informs the equipment that carrier read or carrier write is complete.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 17  Carrier Tag Read/Write (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 17  Carrier Tag Read/Write\n\nContent: For internal buffer equipment the CarrierRelease service shall allow the equipment to move the carrier away from the read or write position. Figure 7The CarrierRelease service has a different purpose from the CarrierOut service. The intent of the CarrierOut service request is to move the carrier to a loadport, while the intent of the CarrierRelease service request is to inform equipment that it may move the carrier away from the read or write position. Therefore, CarrierOut may also be used with the CarrierRelease command. If CarrierHold is Host Release, then the carrier shall be kept at the write position until an CarrierRelease service request is received, regardless of when a CarrierOut is sent. If CarrierHold is set to Equipment Release, then the CarrierRelease request has no effect.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18  Additional Events\n\n18.1  This section identifies data collection events that are not related to State transitions for variable data items. The intent of this section is to ensure certain data is available for specific events that are not related to state transitions, not to define all the additional collection events for CMS. Also, all state transitions in CMS state models are required to have associated event reports.\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event\n\nContent: 18.2.1 An event shall be generated whenever Buffer Capacity changes. This applies to all internal buffers and internal buffer partitions. 18.2.2 Data required to be available for this event report: BufferPartitionInfo. 18.3 Carrier Approaching Complete Event 18.3.1 In some cases, for carrier transfer efficiency, the host needs to know carrier completion timing a little faster than actual. For example: • If the equipment is internal buffer type, QTAT carriers need to be moved out directly from internal FIMS to a load port to shorten moving out time. • If the equipment uses non-product carriers, such as dummy, they need to be changed before it becomes not reusable to prevent stopping the equipment operation. If the equipment uses non-product carriers, such as test, reject, they need to be changed before it becomes empty or full to prevent stopping the equipment operation. 18.3.2 This event shall be generated when the access by the equipment to the carrier is approaching complete. How the timing of the event is determined\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event\n\nContent: shall be configurable. 18.3.3 Detailed definition of the event timing depends upon the type of usage of the carrier. Some examples of event timing for different types of usage are shown below. 18.3.3.1 PRODUCT — When remaining time until the carrier starts moving from internal FIMS to internal buffer reaches the configurable variable time (internal buffer equipment only). 18.3.3.2 DUMMY — When remaining times until substrates of the carrier becomes not reusable reaches the configurable variable times. 18.3.3.3 TEST — When remaining substrates until the carrier becomes empty reaches the configurable variable number. 18.3.3.4 REJECT — When remaining slots until the carrier becomes full reaches the configurable variable number. 18.3.4 Suppliers shall document the interpretation and the configurable variable(s) in the equipment specification document. 18.3.5 Data required to be available for this event report: CarrierID 18.4 Carrier Clamped Event 18.4.1 An event shall be generated whenever a carrier is clamped. Clamped means\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event\n\nContent: the load port has engaged a device that would inhibit removal or movement of the carrier by any entity external to the load port. Some load ports may include more than one clamping device. This event should be generated only when the first clamping is engaged. This applies to all load ports. 18.4.2 There is no standard for when load ports clamp a carrier. Therefore the IC makers host systems and personnel will need some signal from the equipment to know if a carrier is clamped. This event provides that signal. This applies to all load ports that provide clamping. If a load ports does not clamp the carrier no event is required. 18.4.3 Data required to be available for this event report: Port ID, Carrier ID (if available), and Location ID. 18.5 Carrier Closed Event 18.5.1 If the carrier is equipped with a door, an event shall be generated when a carrier door has been closed. 18.5.2 Data required to be available for this event report: CarrierID, LocationID, and PortID (if valid). 18.6 Carrier Location Change Event 18.6.1 An\n\nSEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E87-0705 SPECIFICATION FOR CARRIER MANAGEMENT (CMS) - # 18.2  Buffer Capacity Changed Event\n\nContent: event shall be generated whenever a carrier has changed location.

Unclamped means that the load port has disengaged any devices that would inhibit removal or movement of the carrier by any entity external to the load port. Some load ports may include more than one clamping device. This event should be generated only when all clamping or locking devices are disengaged. 18.8.2 There is no standard for when load ports unclamp a carrier. Therefore the IC makers host systems and personnel will need some signal from the equipment to know if a carrier is unclamped. This event provides that signal.

The model consists of equipment characteristics and behaviors that are to be implemented in addition to the SEMI E30 fundamental requirements and selected additional capabilities. The intent of this standard is to facilitate the integration of Stocker SEM equipment into an automated (e.g., semiconductor fabrication and flat panel display) factory. This document accomplishes this by defining an operational model for Stocker SEM equipment as viewed by a factory automation controller (Host). This definition provides a standard host interface and equipment operational behavior (e.g., control, state models, and data reports). Several topics require additional activity that are within the scope of this standard: queuing, parallel interface for carrier transfer (SEMI E23), stocker controller architecture, and scheduling and transport of the transfer unit. responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 3.1  SEMI Standards Alignment\n\n3.1.1  The GEM (SEMI E30) model was used as the basis for Stocker SEM requirements definition in alignment with existing AMHS SEM Specifications.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 3.2  AMHS Storage Equipment Description\n\n3.2.1  This standard is targeted at the different types/configurations of $3 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ \\ m m }$ AMHS storage equipment.

It defines the view of the equipment through the SECS communication link. It does not define the internal operation of the equipment. It includes a specific transfer command state model and stocker controller state model as the basis for all equipment of this class. 2.2 This document assumes that the GEM fundamental requirements and selected additional capabilities (as specified in Section 13) have been implemented on the Stocker SEM equipment. It expands the GEM standard requirements and capabilities in the areas of state models (stocker controller, transfer command, carrier and stocker crane state models), collection events, alarm documentation, remote commands, data item variables, and material movement.

The destination of the transfer command is required.  It would be invalid for the Host to issue a transfer command to the SC without including a valid destination.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.1.2  Output to the Interbay Output Port\n\n6.1.2.1  The destination for a transfer command to move a carrier to an interbay output port must be a loading port.  It is the responsibility of the Host to ensure that sufficient capacity exists in the destination stocker when delivering from a source stocker to a destination stocker (i.e., an interbay move).  For example, it would be the responsibility of the Host to check the remaining capacity of the destination stocker prior to issuing the transfer command to send the carrier to the interbay output port of the source stocker.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.1.3  Output to the Intrabay Output Port\n\n6.1.3.1  The destination for a transfer command to move a carrier to an intrabay output port must be a loading port.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.1.4  Store to the Stocker Shelf\n\n6.1.4.1  The specific stocker shelf location is to be controlled by the Stocker Controller  (SC).  The Host does not specify a shelf ID in a transfer command.  The Host sends the name of a zone as the destination in the transfer command  \n6.1.4.2  The carrier is stored to a stocker shelf temporarily when the Host requested output port destination is occupied. This is the responsibility of the Stocker Controller. The carrier count of the stocker is incremented due to this temporary storage (i.e., the current capacity decreases).  \n6.1.4.3  For multi-crane stockers, the carrier is temporarily stored to a stocker shelf when the source and destination is not accessible by the same stocker crane. This is the responsibility of the Stocker Controller. The carrier count of the zone containing the location where the carrier is temporarily stored is incremented due to this temporary storage (i.e. the current capacity decreases).\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.2  Quantity Control in the Stocker (Capacity Planning)\n\n6.2.1  The number of carriers in the stocker is controlled by the Host.  A list of carrier database entries in the specified stocker’s SC database will be available to the Host upon request via a remote command.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.3  Number of Stocker Cranes\n\n6.3.1  No Limitation.  May be zero for systems that do not include a crane.  Host does not control the stocker crane directly.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.4  Port Type\n\n6.4.1  The independent input port and the independent output port are required for the Stocker SEM.  The swapping type is considered as an independent port.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.5  Plural Sets of Input/Output Ports\n\n6.5.1  Plural sets of Input/Output ports connected to the interbay or intrabay transport system must be considered.  (This would be considered a Multi-loop type interface connection to the stocker.) Examples of plural sets of interfaces are as follows:  \nMain Loop/Sub Loop, Right-handed rotation/Left-handed rotation, and Double Track (i.e., Stacked Track).\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.6  Carrier ID Reader\n\nManual Input Port: Carrier ID Reader is mandatory.\nAutomated Input Port: Carrier ID Reader is a customer option.\nCarrier ID Reader at any output port: Carrier ID Reader is a customer option.  \n6.6.1  The intrabay automated input port is sometimes used as the manual Input Port.  If one port is used for both an automated and a manual, the Carrier ID Reader is mandatory for this port.  If there is a Carrier ID Reader, the scenario for a stocker transfer without a Carrier ID Reader is not applicable.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 6.7  Tag\n\n6.7.1  Same assumptions as Carrier ID Reader.\n6.8  Carrier Exchanger/Gas Purger\n6.8.1  Out of scope of Stocker SEM.\n6.9  Robot Arm in the Passive Type Stocker\n6.9.1  No assumption is made regarding the passive\ntype stocker.\n6.10  Empty or Not Empty Carriers\n6.10.1  No assumption is made regarding empty and not\nempty carriers.\n6.11  Monitor/Dummy\n6.11.1  No assumption.\n6.12  Operation Mode\n6.12.1  No assumption.  \n6.13.1  The Transfer Completed Port is always the LoadingPort (LP) specified in the transfer command.  If the end user desires that the Host issue a transfer to the TSC prior to the carrier arriving at the LP, the states defined in the Stocker Carrier State Model may be utilized.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 7  Communication Requirements\n\n7.1  It is required that any Stocker SEM compliant equipment follow the Communications State Model in SEMI E30. In addition, Stocker SEM compliant equipment shall support either SEMI E37 and SEMI E37.1 or SEMI E4.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.1  State Model Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.1  State Model Requirements\n\nContent: 8.1.1 The state models included in this standard are a requirement for Stocker SEM equipment. This standard requires implementation of all SEMI E30 state models (such as control, communication, on-line/off-line, etc. according to the GEM capabilities required per Section 13). A state model consists of a state model diagram, state definitions, and a state transition table. All state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events. 8.1.2 A state model is the host’s view of the equipment, and does not necessarily describe the internal equipment operation. All Stocker SEM state model transitions shall be mapped into the appropriate internal equipment events that satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of the conditions required by the Stocker SEM state model for transition to another state. The equipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in this\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.1  State Model Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.1  State Model Requirements\n\nContent: situation. 8.1.3 Some equipment may need to include additional substates other than those in this standard. Additional substates may be added, but shall not change the Stocker SEM defined state transitions. All expected transitions between Stocker SEM states shall occur.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.2.1  SC State Model Requirements\n\n8.2.1.1  The purpose of the SC state model is to provide information to the host regarding the overall status of the stocker system. The SC state model is valid when the SEMI E30 (GEM) state is ON-LINE. The SC state model is not valid when the SEMI E30 (GEM) state is OFF-LINE. Since a stocker may consist of many components (e.g.,  \nstocker crane, conveyor, ID reader, etc.), it may be possible to continue ON-LINE operation when the operation mode of some stocker components (as viewed by the SC) is a manual state. The details of what happens when individual components of the stocker enter a manual state are specific to the Stocker SEM equipment supplier. When the SEMI E30 Control state changes from OFF-LINE to ON-LINE, the SC State Model is started from the SC INIT state.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.2.3  SC State Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.2.3  SC State Definitions\n\nContent: 8.2.3.1 SC INIT — SC initialization of stocker components is occurring. This is a non-operational state. No commands from the host will be acknowledged, queued or processed. The system will not move out of this state if there are carriers moving on any of the stocker units controlled by the SC. Such devices must be manually or automatically recovered before transitioning to the next state. 8.2.3.2 PAUSING — A system PAUSE command has been received and is being processed. All carriers that are currently moving will continue until their physical movement stops (their transfer command may still be active). Carriers that are currently moving may continue to move but they must not begin another movement. TRANSFER commands are accepted and queued. All status requests will be processed. The RESUME, INSTALL, REMOVE, and LOCATE commands will also be processed. 8.2.3.3 PAUSED — No carriers are in the process of moving on any of the stocker units controlled by the SC. Carriers may be at any port position including the OP, BP, and LP\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.2.3  SC State Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.2.3  SC State Definitions\n\nContent: positions. TRANSFER commands are accepted and queued. All status requests will be processed. The RESUME, INSTALL, REMOVE, and LOCATE commands will also be processed. 8.2.3.4 AUTO — Stocker is in the normal operational state. Commands are actively processed. 8.2.3.5 NO ALARMS — There are no alarms present in the system. 8.2.3.6 ALARMS — There are one or more alarms present in the system.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.2.4  SC State Transition Table\n\nTable 1  SC State Transition Table\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.3.1  TRANSFER Command State Model Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.3.1  TRANSFER Command State Model Requirements\n\nContent: 8.3.1.1 The TRANSFER command state model serves as the SEMI E30 Processing State Model. The purpose of the TRANSFER command state model is to provide information to the host regarding the control of the TRANSFER command. The TRANSFER command allows the host to manage carrier movement and scheduling. The control of each TRANSFER command must independently support the TRANSFER command state model. 8.3.2 TRANSFER Command State Model Diagram 8.3.2.1 The TRANSFER command state model is detailed for Stocker SEM equipment in Figure 4. 8.3.3 TRANSFER Command State Definitions 8.3.3.1 QUEUED — SC has acknowledged and queued the TRANSFER command. TRANSFER command has not been initiated. 8.3.3.2 ACTIVE — The carrier is involved in the physical aspect of the TRANSFER command. It is denoted by the time spanned by command initiation to command completion. 8.3.3.3 TRANSFERRING (ACTIVE sub-state) — The transfer command is actively being executed by the stocker. 8.3.3.4 PAUSED (ACTIVE sub-state) — The Transfer command\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.3.1  TRANSFER Command State Model Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.3.1  TRANSFER Command State Model Requirements\n\nContent: is not actively being executed by the stocker. This may be due to an internal equipment error that does not immediately terminate the Transfer command unsuccessfully. This would allow the Host or Operator the opportunity to retry the transfer. 8.3.3.5 CANCELING — The TRANSFER command cancel procedure is being performed to terminate a transfer command which never entered the ACTIVE state (currently QUEUED). This state is entered via a CANCEL remote command. 8.3.3.6 ABORTING — The TRANSFER command abort procedure is being performed to terminate a transfer command which has entered the ACTIVE state. This state can only be entered via an ABORT remote command. An unsuccessful transfer command completion will ultimately result from this state. 8.3.4 TRANSFER Command State Transition Table Table 2 Transfer Command State Transition Table\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.4  Stocker Carrier State Model\n\n8.4.1  Stocker Carrier State Model Requirements  \n8.4.1.1  The purpose of the stocker carrier state model is to provide information to the host regarding carrier tracking (the Host will not control carriers) while the carrier is in the domain of the stocker.  The carrier is in the domain of the stocker when it is in storage or transport internal to the stocker or on a stocker interface port (manual, interbay, or intrabay). The equipment shall track each carrier in compliance with the Stocker Carrier State Model.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.4.3  Stocker Carrier State Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.4.3  Stocker Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: 8.4.3.1 INSTALLED — Carrier in stocker database. 8.4.3.2 WAIT IN (INSTALLED sub-state) — Carrier at final internal port location of the stocker. Carrier is ready to be transferred to storage or output location and no further movement or action should be taken on this carrier prior to transfer. 8.4.3.3 WAIT OUT (INSTALLED sub-state) — Carrier is at an Output, Buffer, or Loading Port. 8.4.3.4 TRANSFERRING (INSTALLED sub-state) — Carrier ‘moving’ between locations in the stocker. The carrier may not be physically moving but may be on the crane (or other position) waiting for a new TRANSFER command as the result of an anomaly condition. 8.4.3.5 STORED (INSTALLED sub-state) — Carrier is sitting at a storage location. 8.4.3.6 COMPLETED (STORED sub-state) — The carrier is stored at a shelf location as a result of completing a transfer for which this shelf represents the destination of the transfer command. 8.4.3.7 ALTERNATE (STORED sub-state) — The carrier is temporarily stored at a shelf location. The transfe\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.4.3  Stocker Carrier State Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.4.3  Stocker Carrier State Definitions\n\nContent: command completion is pending until the destination and the crane become available.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.5.1  Stocker Crane State Model Requirements\n\n8.5.1.1  The purpose of the stocker crane state model is to provide information to the host for use of stocker crane information and metric tracking (i.e., the Host will not control the stocker crane). If it is possible for the stocker to continue operation while the stocker crane is not operational then the Stocker Crane State Model will retain its current state and the SC State Model will be ALARM. When the stocker crane becomes operational again, the state of the Stocker Crane State Model will transition to the new state. Whether it is possible to continue operation while the stocker crane is not operational is specific to the stocker SEM equipment supplier. If a single stocker contains multiple stocker cranes, each stocker crane must comply with the stocker crane state model. Compliance with the stocker crane state model is only required for devices that contain a crane. The Host should not be dependent on any events from the stocker crane state model.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.5.3  Stocker Crane State Definitions\n\n8.5.3.1  IDLE — The stocker crane is not performing Host or SC initiated work.\n8.5.3.2  ACTIVE — The stocker crane is busy performing Host or SC initiated work.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.5.4  Stocker Crane State Transition Table\n\nTable 4  Stocker Crane State Transition Table\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.6.1  Port Transfer State Model Requirements\n\n8.6.1.1  The purpose of the port state model is to provided information to the host for the use in accessing ports. This may permit the host and stocker to utilize ports that are in service while avoiding the use of ports that are not in service.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.6.3  Port Transfer State Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.6.3  Port Transfer State Definitions\n\nContent: 8.6.3.1 OUT OF SERVICE — Transfer to/from this port is disabled and the port should not be used in any Transfer command issued by the host. If the SC State is “Alarm” and the port cannot be accessed normally, the port transfer state shall be “Out Of Service”. This includes situations where the “Alarm” may not be directly related to the port. For example, the alarm may be associated with the crane and since the crane cannot function, the port cannot be serviced normally. If any port on a multi-position conveyor with a single LP position is “Out Of Service”, then all ports on the conveyor shall be “Out Of Service”. If a command is issued by the host which uses this port, it will not be rejected simply because the port is in this state. 8.6.3.2 IN SERVICE — Transfer to/from this port is enabled. 8.6.3.3 The following are optional sub-states of the IN SERVICE state to provide information to the host for the use in accessing ports. The information is generally obtained by the SC via a low-level interface with the\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.6.3  Port Transfer State Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.6.3  Port Transfer State Definitions\n\nContent: connected equipment (generally inline process tools). The connected equipment should generally, though not required, follow the Load Port Transfer State Model defined in SEMI E87. If these states are implemented, they are not required for every port. 8.6.3.3.1 TRANSFER BLOCKED — The state is neither READY TO LOAD nor READY TO UNLOAD. 8.6.3.3.2 READY TO LOAD — The port is able to accept (be loaded with) a carrier from the Stocker SEM equipment. 8.6.3.3.3 READY TO UNLOAD — The port is able to have a carrier removed (unloaded) by the Stocker SEM equipment.\n\nSEMI E88-1104ESPECIFICATION FOR AMHS STORAGE SEM (STOCKER SEM) - # 8.6.3.4  Port Transfer State Transition Table\n\nTable 5  Port Transfer State Transition Table",
