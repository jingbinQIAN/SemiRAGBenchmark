The Process Job creates a transient link between the three elements of the manufacturing process; the first is the material to be processed. The second is the equipment on which the process will occur. The third is the process specification, a Process Recipe. When a Process Job has completed, it ceases to exist; its Process Job ID is no longer valid. The control job is used to group a set of related process jobs. The group is logically related from the host’s viewpoint. For instance; if a carrier contains multiple lots, then the process jobs for each lot (in the carrier) could be included in the control job specification. Control jobs also provide mechanisms for specifying the destination for processed material.\n\n10.21  Stream 17 Equipment Control and Diagnostics — This stream is a continuation of Stream 2.  \n10.22  Stream 18 Subsystem Control and Data — Messages exchanged between component subsystems and higher level controllers.  Compared to similar messages exchanged between equipment and host, subsystem messages are less complex.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 11  Message Documentation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 11  Message Documentation\n\nContent: 11.1 Intent — Equipment makers using SECS-II messages must communicate the equipment-specific details of each message to the host designer in order for the host to properly adapt to the equipment. The details are communicated in a document which will follow a standard form in order to convey most clearly the information required. The following form is presented here to act as a guide for organizing the equipmentspecific details. 11.2 Standard Form SECS-II Document — The standard form will contain three clearly labeled parts as follows. Part I — General Information Part II — Message Summary Part III — Message Detail 11.2.1 Part I will contain general information on the following: Manufacturer and product number General description of equipment function Intended function of interface Software revision code Changes from previous versions 11.2.2 Part II will contain two lists of all messages understood and all messages sent by the equipment in terms of their stream and function codes. The first list will have\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 11  Message Documentation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 11  Message Documentation\n\nContent: pairs of columns: the first for the message received and understood and the second for the message sent in response. The second list will also have two columns: the first for the message sent and the second for the response understood. The message will be identified using the format “SxxFyy,” where xx is the stream number and yy is the function number. Each transaction will be on a separate line. A “-” will indicate that one of a pair is not included. All messages not listed on the received side are implied to cause an error message to the host. All messages not listed on the sent side are assumed never to be sent from the equipment. Since some messages can be sent in two directions, the same message pair may appear in each list with the sent and received orders interchanged. A transaction listed in the standard as being allowed in two directions does not have to be implemented in both directions. This list will indicate which directions are implemented. 11.2.3 Part III will contain the details for every\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 11  Message Documentation (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 11  Message Documentation\n\nContent: message listed in Part II. Messages that appear on both the sent and received sides must be detailed separately. The details shall include the following information on the data in each message: 1. For each fixed item, all the values or strings either understood or possible to send are listed along with their meaning to the equipment. 2. For each variable item, the restriction on or possible range of value or length of string. 3. Any other special interpretation of the message. 11.2.4 Each message so detailed must be clearly labeled with its stream and function code.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: 12.1 Intent — Certain SECS-II transactions require specification of units of measure for data items passed between equipment and host. The concept of units of measure has been included as part of the SECS-II standard to enhance the ability of the host system to prompt its human operators for proper information when generating process programs, and also to facilitate automated handling of process programs by host systems and automated handling of data reported to a host by equipment. 12.2 Units Symbols — Under SECS-II, a units symbol is a text string of unspecified length which specifies the physical significance of a numeric value. Units of measure symbols under SECS-II may be either a SECSII recognized unit identifier, a SECS-II unit identifier with prefix and/or suffix symbols, or an arithmetic expression of SECS-II identifiers. 12.2.1 A SECS-II units identifier is a text string which may be the full name, an abbreviation of the full name, or a special character which is unique for a specific unit of weight or\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: measure. Identifier strings may consist of upper or lower case alphabetic characters and numerals or special characters of the ASCII character set. The first character of an identifier may not be a numeral. The case of alphabetic characters is significant (e.g., G and g, the units symbols for Gauss and gram, respectively). 12.2.2 A unit identifier may be nationally or internationally recognized, may be unique to the semiconductor industry, or, due to the special requirements of SECS-II, may be unique to this standard. Section 12.4 lists all units identifiers recognized by SECS-II. For each identifier defined in Section 12.4, six pieces of information are provided. They are: 1. Unit — Full name of the unit of measure in question. 2. Unit Identifier — SECS-II-recognized identifier for the unit. 3. Prefix Allowed — Specifies whether or not the unit identifier may be combined with a prefix symbol to generate a unit identifier which is a decimal multiple or submultiple of the base unit. Metric (or SI) units are\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: usually capable of accepting a prefix symbol while English units may not. 4. Suffix Allowed — Specifies whether or not the unit identifier may be concatenated with a numeric suffix which provides additional information to the meaning of the associated unit symbol. The numeric suffix is composed of the ASCII digits 0 through 9 and represents a decimal value. This meaning of the numeric value is symbol-dependent and must be specified in the description section of the unit symbol’s definition. 5. Equivalence — In those cases where a unit can be expressed as an arithmetic expression (of simpler units), this column will contain the expression of simpler units. For those units which are nonstandard to either of the standard systems of units of measure (English or SI), this column will contain an expression which relates the non standard unit to the equivalent unit of the standard units system. In either case, the expression provided in this column may be substituted for the corresponding SECS-II units identifier\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: whenever required. 6. Description — Additional information as may be required to uniquely define the unit of measure in question. 12.2.3 Any SECS-II identifier which Section 12.4 indicates as being capable of taking on a prefix symbol may be appended to one of the prefix symbols shown in Table 23, forming a new unit which is a decimal multiple or submultiple of the base unit. A prefix symbol may not be used alone. It must appear concatenated to one of the identifiers in Section 12.4. Finally, only one prefix symbol may appear before any identifier. A units symbol such as “mus” (micromillisecond) is not allowed. The proper symbol is “ns” (nanosecond). Table 23 12.2.4 Any SECS-II identifier which Section 12.4 indicates as being capable of taking on a suffix value may have a numeric string appended to it. This decimal value allows the user to identify one of a family of symbol names with only the generic symbol name of the family being defined in Section 12.4. The meaning of a numeric suffix is dependent on the\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: particular symbol with which it is being used and must be defined in the description section of the symbol definition. 12.2.5 Arithmetic expressions of units of measure identifiers are recognized by SECS-II as units symbols if they are formed by the following rules: 1. All units identifiers in the expression are SECS-II units identifiers defined in Section 12.4 or SECS-II prefixed units identifiers as defined above. 2. Exponentiation is denoted by a circumflex (^) between the identifier to be operated on and the exponent. Exponents may be positive or negative values. A negative value is denoted by a unary minus sign (-) between the circumflex and exponent. For positive values, the exponent will immediately follow the circumflex $\\mathbf { A } ^ { \\wedge } 2$ or $\\mathbf { A } ^ { \\wedge _ { - 2 } }$ ). 3. Multiplication of units identifiers is expressed by an asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ positioned between the factors to be multiplied $( \\mathsf { A } ^ { * } \\mathsf { B } )$ . 4. Division of units identifiers is\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: expressed by a slash $( / )$ positioned between the dividend and divisor. Division may also be expressed as the product of the dividend and the divisor with a negative exponent (A/B or $\\mathbf { A } ^ { * } \\mathbf { B } ^ { \\wedge _ { - 1 } }$ ). 5. Parentheses may be used to specify the order in which the arithmetic operations will be performed. 6. Within expressions or sub-expressions where parentheses do not specify the order of operations, exponentiation will be carried out first, followed by left-to-right evaluation of all multiplication and division that is $( \\mathbf { A } ^ { * } \\mathbf { B } ^ { \\wedge } - 2 ^ { * } 3 0 ^ { * } \\mathbf { C } ^ { \\wedge } 2 )$ is equivalent to $( ( ( \\mathrm { A } / ( \\mathrm { B } ^ { \\wedge } 2 ) ) ^ { * } 3 0 ) ^ { * } ( \\mathrm { C } ^ { \\wedge } 2 ) )$ . 12.3 Compliance — For the units of measure information to have any value and to be in compliance with SECS-II, equipment and host system manufacturers must ensure that only units symbols allowed by SECS-II are\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: used by their systems. In those instances where SECS-II does not provide a units symbol required for a particular application, the manufacturer requiring the new symbol may submit a proposal to the SEMI Communications Subcommittee requesting the enhancement. A proposal must include all the information provided by each entry of Section 12.4 as described above. 12.3.1 A proposal must undergo the full approval cycle as prescribed by SECS-II for amending a standard (acceptance by committee, balloting, etc.). As a result, the proposal should be submitted as soon as possible, so that sufficient time is available to complete the standard amendment process and to notify all interested parties of the change before the product requiring the new symbol becomes available for use in a manufacturing facility. 12.4 SECS-II Units of Measure Identifiers — All units of measure symbols recognized by SECS-II are defined in this section or are compound symbols based on the identifiers defined here and formed by the rules specified in\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # 12  Units of Measure\n\nContent: Section 12.2.

To illustrate which messages might be appropriate, the following suggestions are offered for a variety of different types of equipment capabilities. It is assumed that the minimum message sets S1,F1; F2 and S9,F1; F3; F5; F7 are always implemented. R1-2.2 For equipment which makes nondestructive inprocess measurements using a fixed measurement procedure, it may be necessary only to implement S6, F9 to send the data according to a fixed format upon measurement. Optional remote control can be added with S2,F21 to start a measurement. R1-2.3 If the equipment has a variety of measurement routines, it might be desirable to respond to S1,F5 with S1,F6, which would give the host a brief report of the test being made. The test can be thought of as a process program. Accordingly, S7,F1 and S7,F2 could be used for the host to select the program. The same messages in conjunction\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-2  Some Suggested Message Usage (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-2  Some Suggested Message Usage\n\nContent: with S7,F3 and S7,F4 could load a new test procedure. S7,F19 could be used by the host to find out what tests were available. R1-2.4 Some equipment which automatically processes wafers in a batch might make more extensive use of S1,F5 or S1,F3 and might include some error reporting on S5,F1. More sophisticated equipment may include some trace features with S2,F23 and S6,F1 or some control loop tuning by S2,F15. R1-2.5 Equipment using in-line wafer movement could utilize Stream 4, S1,F9, and Stream 3 to keep track of wafers. R1-2.6 Stream 7,F9 through F19 can be used to manage a local backup of process programs should the host fail for a short while. R1-2.7 Microprocessor equipment can benefit from features such as provided by Stream 8 and S2,F1 through F12 which allow managing and servicing the software routines. R1-2.8 Equipment, including a CRT, might elect to make it available to the host by including Stream 10 messages. R1-2.9 Some equipment, such as functional testers, might have sufficient\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-2  Some Suggested Message Usage (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-2  Some Suggested Message Usage\n\nContent: need to undertake remote file usage such as provided in Stream 13. R1-2.10 These brief suggestions serve to illustrate that the final choice of the messages included in a given equipment depends upon its function. The messages can be viewed as interface features in the same way that other parts of the equipment are viewed as processing features or wafer handling features.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.1  Introduction\n\nR1-3.1.1  There are two primary ways to send and ask for data in SECS-II.  One of these is to use the trace feature and the other is to use the event reporting method.  The purpose of this note is to describe the intended operation of the messages described in the existing standard.  Discussion of completeness or need for other reporting methods is left for task force and committee work.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting\n\nContent: R1-3.2.1 This method of collecting data is intended for engineering and developmental use rather than routine data collection for production. The features included allow the collection of relatively large amounts of real time data over a finite amount of time. The data is generated at regular time intervals as determined by a timing generator in the equipment. The function of the host is to set up the trace and then to subsequently store the data as it is received from the equipment. It is assumed that some host resident applications will exist to analyze the data either as it is received or at some later time. R1-3.2.2 The trace feature will only exist in equipment which implements it. R1-3.2.3 The host sets up the trace with the S2,F23-24 transaction. At this time, the host assigns several important parameters. TRID is the trace request ID and is used later when the equipment sends back the data. Every trace data reply includes the TRID corresponding to the request that set up the trace.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting\n\nContent: Several traces can theoretically be done at the same time if the equipment allows it and the TRID keeps the data for each trace distinct from other trace data. DSPER is the data sample period and is used to indicate how often the specified parameters should be sampled (that is, have their values saved). TOTSMP is the total number of samples to be made. Since TOTSMP is finite and the number of parameters is specified in this transaction, the host can reserve adequate file space for the reported data if required. The REPGSZ is the reporting group size and corresponds to the number of time samples that should be combined into one message prior to transmission. Thus, if it is desired to sample one or two parameters every second but only send those samples to the host once a minute, the reporting group size would be 60. Having the reporting group size parameter allows the host to have some control over how often it may be interrupted to handle the trace data. However, as presently defined in the\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting\n\nContent: standard, the trace data is reported as a single block message (S6,F1), which restricts both the number of status variables or the number of samples which can be combined into one message. The equipment may be able to accommodate this in several ways, to be described shortly. R1-3.2.3.1 The last element in the trace initialize request is a list of status variable IDs. The trace command only allows tracing variables that have been declared and are known to the equipment as status variables. It is assumed that the equipment will report the variable values in the same order as specified in the trace request. This will allow the host to identify the values returned. R1-3.2.4 The trace data send message, S6,F1-2, sends the trace data as a single block message to minimize the overhead in reporting data. The TRID is the first item and identifies the request that asked for the data. The next item is SMPLN, the sample number of the last sample in this message, should more than one sample be\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.2  Trace Data Collection and Reporting\n\nContent: combined. The next item is STIME which is the time of the last sample in this message. These three items are followed by the list of values. If five (5) values were requested with a reporting group size of 5, then 25 values would be in this list, each group of 5 in the same order as requested and in the time order sampled. Some flexibility is allowed in how the equipment chooses to report the data to the host when the reporting group size exceeds one block of data. The equipment can send the data when it has a complete block or it can reject the request when it is set up.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting\n\nContent: R1-3.3.1 The second major type of data reporting is initiated by some event in the equipment. Data reporting is often desired after some event such as the completion of a measurement, the completion of a lot, the completion of a wafer, the occurrence of a special event command in the recipe, or some other action which is determined by the equipment. The two aspects involved in event driven data reporting are the control of which events cause data to be sent to the host and the formatting of the data sent to the host. R1-3.3.2 It is assumed that a set of events has been established for a particular piece of equipment and that each event can produce a report of some sort. It is further assumed that a set of equipment constants exist in the machine such that they have control over the optional reporting of the events. For example, a boolean constant may exist for each possible reporting event, and when the host sets the constant to a logical 1, the corresponding event will cause a report to be sent to\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting\n\nContent: the host, when the host sets the constant to logical 0, the event will not send a report. S2,F15-16 in the equipment constant send transaction can be used to control the event reporting. R1-3.3.3 When an event causes data to be sent to the host, there are several possible conversations, depending upon the length of the data and the complexity of the formatting. S6,F3-4 is the basic data transaction, which has a very general format. The parameters provide for an overall name, DATAID, for the type of data; a collection event identification, CEID, should there be more than one event that could generate the same type of data; and a list of data sets. This structure allows reporting such data as the measurements taken on each of the wafers in a lot. The measurements on each wafer make up one data set, and the list of data sets is the whole lot. The collection event would be the lot completion, and the data ID might be film thickness measurements. Other types of organizations are possible, depending upon\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting\n\nContent: the type of data being sent. The same type of data might be produced by a different CEID, such as the forced termination of the lot. This collection ID would indicate that the data is incomplete for the lot. Within each data set, each data value is reported as a pair of items, one item being the name of the value and the other being the value. R1-3.3.4 Since many simple measuring devices have only a very few types of data sets, an alternative data format is provided in S6,F9-10, which has the same form as S6,F3-4 but does not require the value name in the data set. Instead, the order of the values is fixed format for the particular DSID in that particular equipment. R1-3.3.5 When either of the above data messages is long enough to require multiple blocks, it must be preceded by S6,F5-6 to gain permission to send a multiple block message. R1-3.3.6 The last data control transaction is S6,F7-8, which is initiated by the host and causes a specified DATAID to be sent to the host. The implementation of\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.3  Event Driven Data Reporting\n\nContent: this function is highly equipment-dependent. In essence, it is equivalent to the host causing an event that triggers the sending of the data. Since the equipment may be generating the data, the actual data sent depend upon the equipment implementation. The equipment can respond with a zero length item if no data can be sent.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting\n\nContent: R1-3.4.1 The third major type of data reporting is similar to that described in A3.3 above, with the following enhancements: 1. Contents of data reports are not limited to DVVALs, but may include SVs or even ECVs. 2. Contents of data reports are user programmable. R1-3.4.2 It is assumed that the equipment vendor supplies a list of all “events” identified within a particular piece of equipment. A Collection Event Identifier (CEID) must be specified for each of these events. It is further assumed that the vendor supplies a list of all available variables within the machine. This includes Status Variables (SVs) and their identifiers (SVIDs), Equipment constants (ECVs) and their identifiers (ECIDs), and Data Values (DVVALs) and their identifiers(DVNAMEs). Each of the identifiers must be unique. The term VID (Variable Identifier) encompasses all SVIDs, ECIDs, and DVNAMEs. Likewise, the term V (Variable Data) encompasses all SVs, ECVs, and DVVALs. R1-3.4.3 Note that a Variable (V) may be a list (format code 0). This\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting\n\nContent: provides for referencing a group of related data values with one identifier. Consider the following: $\\nabla \\mathtt { I D } _ { 1 } \\ = \\ 1$ zone 1 temperature ID Format 32 V1 zone 1 temperature value Format 52 $\\mathsf { V I D } _ { \\mathrm { n } } \\ = \\ \\mathrm { ~ n ~ }$ zone n temperature ID Format 32 Vn zone n temperature value Format 52 $\\nabla \\mathtt { I D _ { x } } \\ = \\ \\textbf { x }$ all temperatures ID Format 32 Vx L,n Format 0 1. L,2 1. ${ < \\tt V I D _ { 1 } > }$ 2. ${ < } \\mathtt { V } _ { 1 } { > }$ n.

R1-3.4.4 In a typical initialization sequence, the host would define all the desired programmable data reports with S2,F33/S2,F34 (Define Report) transactions. Then S2,F35/S2,F36 (Link Report/Event) transactions would be used to define which reports are to be made by the equipment upon specific events (CEIDs). An individual report may be linked to more than one\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting\n\nContent: event. At this point the host may request reports with the S6,F15/S6,F16 (Report Request) transactions to obtain initial report data and/or to verify reports as defined and linked. Finally, the desired reports would be enabled by the host with S2,F37/S2,F38 (Enable/Disable Event Report) transactions. R1-3.4.5 There are two methods for the equipment to send event reports to the host. S6,F13 includes the Variable Identifier (VID) with each Variable Data item (V). S6,F11 is a shorter form, without the identifiers; some users prefer this form to reduce message size. R1-3.4.6 When any message is long enough to require multiple blocks, it must be preceded by an inquire/grant transaction.The DATAID parameter is used only to link the inquire/grant transaction with a multiblock message. This linkage is to alleviate problems in the case of interleaved messages. A unique value for DATAID must be used for each Inquire/Grant/Send/Acknowledge conversation (similar to the use of SYSBYTES in SECS-I). The DATAID parameter\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-3.4  Event Reporting\n\nContent: should not be used for any other purpose.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.1  Introduction (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.1  Introduction\n\nContent: R1-4.1.1 Two forms of process programs are supported by SECS-II: unformatted and formatted. The contents of an unformatted process program conform to no set standard. The format of the program is defined by the vendor of the equipment and probably bears no similarity to the format used by other vendors for their equipment. Because special programming would be required at the host to understand the equipment’s unique data format, the process program is most likely generated at the machine and the host is only used as a data repository, saving the foreign data for later retransmission to the equipment. S7,F3 and S7,F6 are the SECS-II messages used to move unformatted process programs between host and equipment. R1-4.1.2 Unformatted process programs were the original accepted means for moving processing instructions between host and equipment under SECSII. However, the inability of a host to generate process programs for its subordinate machines was quickly recognized as a severe problem. As a result, the formatted\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.1  Introduction\n\nContent: process program and its associated transactions were added. Five transactions are provided under SECS-II for handling formatted process programs: S7,F23-24, S7,F25-26 allow movement of process programs between host and equipment; S7,F21- 22 originates at a machine and provides a host with the information it needs to generate a process program for that machine; S7,F27-28 allows the equipment to tell the host whether or not the contents of the formatted process program received from the host are valid; and S7,F31-32 provides the host with the ability to ask the equipment to check the validity of a process program without actually downloading the program into the machine for production use.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations\n\nContent: R1-4.2.1 Formatted process programs may be generated at a host or machine. The actions taken to generate one in a machine are left to the equipment manufacturer. If the process program is created at a host, a sequence of operations is assumed. R1-4.2.1.1 Once the host’s process program generator has been invoked and has been told for which machine a process program is to be created, the host editor must obtain a copy of the process capabilities data for that machine. The information may already be available on the host or it may be obtained directly from the machine. In either case, the information originates at the equipment and is obtained using S7,F21-22. (See Section R1-4.4 for additional information.) R1-4.2.1.2 With the machine’s process capabilities in its possession, the process program editor may proceed with creating the desired process program. At the conclusion of the editing session, the new machine process program will either be saved at the host or sent directly to the machine for\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations\n\nContent: storage and/or use.At this point, the process program is known to satisfy a number of constraints, but it is not necessarily completely acceptable to the machine due to interrelationships of the process program data which are too complex to be described in the machine process capabilities data. The host at any time may verify that a process program is truly valid by sending the process program to the machine and asking it to check the process program and tell the host whether or not the process program is, in fact, correct. If not correct, the equipment is expected to provide information on what data in the process program is unacceptable. This action is accomplished through S7,F31-32. This transaction is equivalent to S7,F23-24, with one important exception, the machine is not to do anything with the process program received under S7,F31 except acknowledge that it got the message (S7,F32) and, as soon as it is able, respond with S7,F27, which provides the host with information on the validity of\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations\n\nContent: the process program. In this way, a new version of a process program already held by a machine may be checked for validity without affecting the operation of the machine (i.e., a newer version of a particular process program may be checked while an older version is simultaneously being used by the equipment for material processing). R1-4.2.1.3 At some point, a host resident process program will be required by the equipment for material processing. Transfer of a program may be accomplished in either of two ways. First, the host may initiate transfer by transmitting S7,F23. In this case, immediately upon reception of the message, the equipment is required to respond with S7,F24, which tells the host that the process program arrived and whether or not the process program is accepted for further processing by the equipment. The second means is for the equipment to initiate the transfer by asking for a process program using S7,F25. In this case, the host will send the process program to the equipment\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.2  Normal Sequence of Operations\n\nContent: or tell the equipment it is unable to satisfy the request. S7,F23 may also be used by a piece of equipment to transfer a process program to its host for archiving. In this case, the host will respond with S7,F24 and an appropriate completion code. Likewise, a host may request a process program transfer from its machine using S7,F25. The machine will respond with S7,F26, which will contain the process program or an error indication. R1-4.2.1.4 Following reception by the equipment of the process program, it is the machine’s responsibility to check the contents of the process program for validity and respond to the host with a S7,F27 message formatted with the appropriate information about the just received process program. To complete the process program exchange transaction, the host will acknowledge the S7,F27 message with S7,F28. What is done with the process program once accepted and checked for validity is dependent on the state of the process equipment.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: R1-4.3.1 The underlying assumption of SECS-II formatted process programs is that processing instructions for equipment can be expressed as sequences of commands with parameters. Commands are integer codes which tell the machine what to do. The parameters of each command are numeric (integer or floating point) values, Boolean values, or text strings which specify how to carry out the particular command. This provides a very flexible structure for building process programs but does not provide the specific information (code values, types and number of parameters, legal parameter values, etc.) required by a host system to generate a process program for a particular piece of equipment. Under SECS-II, this information is provided to a host via the machine’s Equipment Process Capabilities Data or PCD. R1-4.3.2 A PCD provides three levels of information global data pertaining to the entire process program; definition of each possible command understood by the machine; and definition of each\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: command parameter. Global process program definition data consist of MDLN, SOFTREV, CMDMAX, BYTMAX, and the list of command descriptors. R1-4.3.3 MDLN and SOFTREV provide the same data to the host as the equipment’s response to the S1,F1 host interrogative, “Are you there?” They are included in the PCD to provide a means of distinguishing between PCDs for different machines and revisions of PCDs for the same piece of equipment. Also, when a process program is generated, the MDLN/SOFTREV values of the PCD are provided in the process program to allow the machine an unambiguous method of determining if the process program was generated from a PCD it understands. R1-4.3.4 BYTMAX and CMDMAX are two integer values which allow the equipment to limit the size of the process program which will be generated. BYTMAX specifies the maximum number of bytes a process program may occupy. CMDMAX specifies the maximum number of commands which may appear in the process program. Either value may be zero, which\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: indicates that no maximum limit is being imposed by the equipment. R1-4.3.5 The PCD command list identifies (in no particular order) each of the unique operations its associated machine is capable of performing. These operations may correspond to processing operations of the equipment (bake, spin), initialization of equipment components (set beamline controls), definition of data values referenced by later commands (define bond coordinates or inspection points), or even “pseudooperations,” which allow conditional execution of the process program (go to X; if temperature out of range, then go to y; repeat ramping until speed 200; etc.). R1-4.3.6 Each command in the PCDlist has a number of data values associated with it which provide the host with the command’s personality. These are CCODE, CNAME, RQCMD, BLKDEF, BCDS, IBCDS, NBCDS, ACDS, IACDS, NACDS, and the commands parameter list. R1-4.3.7 CCODE defines the unique numeric code which the equipment recognizes as representing the command\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: being defined. CNAME is a text string which hopefully describes the function of the command. The string must be unique for each command since humans generating process programs at the host will use them, and the host process program generator will translate the CNAME to the corresponding CCODE. R1-4.3.8 RQCMD. This Boolean value allows equipment to specify whether or not a command must appear at least once within their process program. If true, the command must be used. If RQCMD is set false, the command may or may not be used in the process program at the discretion of the person creating the process program. R1-4.3.9 In addition to the information the PCD provides on allowed data content within a process program, it also can provide information to the host on possible interdependencies between the commands. Specifically, through the PCD the host can know such things as: command code A must appear before command code B; command code A must come after command code D; command code A must\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: immediately precede command code X; command code A must not come before command code E; command code A must not come after command code F; and/or command code A must immediately come after command code T. Each of the PCD entries, BCDS (before codes), ACDS (after codes), IBCDS (immediately before codes), IACDS (immediately after codes), NBCDS (not before codes), and NACDS (not after codes), is a SECS item which may contain one or more command codes. Each particular item defines the relation to be satisfied. The elements of the item identify the command codes which are to satisfy the relation with the command being defined. A zero length item indicates that no restrictions apply for that type of checking. For example, if the values of the various fields take on the values shown in Figure R1-1, the host process program editor will assure that the TEST command (code 10) will occur before commands with codes 5, 6, and 8; that it will come after commands with codes 100 and 2; that TEST will not\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: appear after the command with code 20; and that each occurrence of command code 3 will have a TEST command immediately before it, subject to the block checking limitations described elsewhere. $\\mathbf { C N A M E } = \\mathbf { T E S T }$ $\\mathrm { C C O D E } = 1 0 \\$ $\\mathrm { B C D S } = 5 { , } 6 { , } 8$ $\\mathrm { I B C D S } = 3$ $\\mathbf { N B C D S } = \\Re$ none $\\mathrm { A C D S } = 1 0 0 . 2$ $\\mathrm { I A C D S } =$ none $\\mathrm { N A C D S } = 2 0$ Figure R1-1 Figure R1-2 R1-4.3.10 Associated with before/after checking is the concept of a block which allows setting of limits on before/after checking. A block consists of a start block command, a block terminator command and possibly body commands, commands which are included between the start and terminator commands. There are no specific command codes for start, or terminator commands in SECS-II formatted process programs. Instead, being a start block, terminator block, or body command is merely an attribute of each\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: command defined in the PCD. The field BLKDEF defines this attribute for each command. A positive one indicates the command starts a new block. Zero indicates that the command is a body command and neither starts nor terminates a block. A value of negative one indicates that the command is a terminator command. R1-4.3.11 Before/after checking for a particular command is performed only with other commands within the same block. To be within the same block, a command must have the same nesting level as the command of interest or the command must be a contained block. R1-4.3.11.1 The example data in Figure R1-2 shows six grouping of commands for before/after checking: (A,B',N), (B,C,D',G',M), (D,E,F), (G,H',L), (H,I',K), (I,J). A letter followed by an apostrophe (') indicates a block which has been collapsed to a command and has the before/after attributes of its start block command. Note that body and terminator commands occur in only one grouping, while block start commands occur in two.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: Also, note that the outermost block is assumed to begin with the first command of the process program and to end with the last command. R1-4.3.12 Each command’s parameter list defines the parameters required by the equipment to carry out each particular command. The order in which each parameter descriptor appears in the PCD parameter list also defines the order in which parameters will appear in a process program command parameter list. Each parameter is one of three possible types: numeric, text, or Boolean. R1-4.3.13 Regardless of parameter type, the first four elements of any parameter descriptor list are the same. The first field, PNAME, specifies the text string which names the parameter. This data will be displayed by a host when prompting a human for the parameter data. The second field, RQPAR, specifies if the value must be specified at the time the process program is generated (true) or if specifying the data is optional (false). The third field, PDFLT, identifies the type of data\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: to be accepted for this parameter as well as providing default values to include in the process program if the RQPAR is false and no data is input for the parameter when the process program is generated. PDFLT will have zero length if no default value is provided. R1-4.3.14 The final field, PMAX, specifies the maximum length of the parameter data placed in a process program. For numeric and Boolean data, it specifies the maximum number of data entries in the SECS-II item. For a string parameter, it specifies the maximum number of characters acceptable to the machine. In either case, negative values are invalid and a value of zero indicates there is no length restriction. R1-4.3.15 For numeric and Boolean parameters which are multi-valued items, usage of PDFLT becomes a bit more complex. In these cases, PDFLT may also be a vector of values. When default values are to be included in a process program, the entry of the default vector in the same ordinal position as the parameter entry\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: requiring the default is used. If the parameter is allowed to have $\\mathbf { N }$ entries but only M defaults are provided, the last N-M parameter entries will have no defaults. R1-4.3.16 If the numeric or Boolean vector parameter is required to be entered, PDFLT will contain no default data values, but dummy values must be provided so that the length of the item specifies the minimum number of entries the equipment expects to receive for the parameter. If this minimum number of entries exceeds the maximum number of entries allowed for the parameter (PMAX), then only PMAX entries will be provided in the process program. R1-4.3.17 Numeric parameters may be any of the SECS recognized floating point or integer data types. PDFLT identifies the particular type. ULIM and LLIM will be of the same data type and specify the range of legal values for the parameter $( { \\mathrm { L L I M } } \\leq \\mathbf { x } \\leq { \\mathrm { U L I M } } )$ . UNITS is a character string formed according to E5,\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: Section 12, which specifies the expected units of measure of the numeric value. RESC specifies whether the resolution of the data item to be entered is to be in terms of a fundamental increment or significant digits. In the case of the former, RESV will be of the same type as the expected parameter and will specify the base increment. In the case of the latter, RESV will be an integer and will specify the number of significant digits to accept for the parameter. R1-4.3.18 In addition to the standard fields described above, string parameter descriptors have one unique field. This field provides a set of template strings. A text parameter will be assumed valid by a host process program generator if it matches one of the template strings. A match occurs if the input string is at least as long as the corresponding template and each position of the template and data strings match. A null string specified as a template will result in a match with any data string. A null data string will match\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.3  Equipment Process Capabilities Data\n\nContent: only a null template string.

However, inasmuch as an equipment’s PCD may be rather large and the equipment may have limited storage capacity, constant availability may be impossible. In these cases, some compromise will have to be made such as making it available only at machine initialization or when idle. In extremely severe cases, an equipment manufacturer may have to provide the PCD data with the rest of the machine documentation, requiring his customer to manually enter the data into his host system. R1-4.4.2 In light of this difficulty, host systems should maintain copies of PCD’s for each piece of equipment under its control and not expect to be able to obtain the PCD from the machine whenever it is required. Doing so, in fact, will permit more flexible process program development in the host, allowing creation of process programs even when equipment is not online and encourage the use of formatted\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.4  Equipment Capabilities Descriptor Availability (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-4.4  Equipment Capabilities Descriptor Availability\n\nContent: process programs by equipment manufacturers.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.1  Purpose and Scope\n\nR1-5.1.1  This document provides a recommendation prepared by the Rigid Disk Subcommittee for generating a baseline implementation of the SECS (SEMI Equipment Communication Standard) standards on production process and test equipment.  This document is not a tutorial to aid in understanding SECS but rather serves as an introduction to the requirements of SECS, and a brief guide to the selection of SECS messages for equipment.  Actual system requirements of many implementations are beyond the scope of this document.  The full standards, SEMI Equipment Communications Standard I (SECS-I), SEMI E4 and SEMI Equipment Communications Standard II (SECSII), SEMI E5 should be consulted by all users.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.2  Introduction\n\nR1-5.2.1  The SECS standards are an existing and developed set of communication standards currently used by the semiconductor and other industries to support automated production.  The standards provide a means for communicating information and control between production equipment and a “host” computer. This transfer of information and control can be used to provide production tracking and location of WIP (Work-In-Process), scheduling of WIP and control of material transfer at the equipment.  The process measurements and records can be used to provide process engineers with a database for statistical process control.  SECS messages are appropriate to a wide variety of applications, including measurement, processing, and material transport equipment.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.3  SECS-I Standard\n\nR1-5.3.1  SECS-I defines the lower protocol layers of a point-to-point interface between equipment and a host computer system.  The standard requires a simple, well understood physical interface, RS-232.  The SECS-I protocol allows the equipment control over the  \nprotocol: the equipment is the master of the link and can initiate the transfer of a message to the host. Likewise, the equipment can regulate the receipt of a message by its response to a handshake to receive the message.  Thus, the interface takes place at the convenience of the equipment, and equipment with very limited computer resources can still support the standard.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.4  SECS-II Standard (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.4  SECS-II Standard\n\nContent: R1-5.4.1 SECS-II defines the higher layer in the protocol, including message content, structure, and data types and their formats. SECS-II defines messages in sets with related functions called Streams. The actual content of the messages are specific to an application, but it is possible for a properly designed host software system to unpack a message and present the data in a meaningful way with no prior definition as to the content. Equipment need only implement those messages appropriate to meet its system requirements; thus, very simple equipment will require implementation of few messages. R1-5.4.2 Application Note A2 contains some suggestions for message utilization, including some information on minimum message sets. It is the intent of this report to expand in a somewhat different direction, to identify those messages which typically constitute a sufficient set given a selected equipment function. R1-5.4.3 To select a message set, the requirements for the equipment must be identified. This\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.4  SECS-II Standard (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.4  SECS-II Standard\n\nContent: requirement, in turn, determines a message set. Identified below are a number of types of equipment requirements and a baseline set of messages supporting those requirements. The message sets identified are baseline recommendations. Actual equipment implementations may need more messages than those specified here to satisfy all system requirements. The published standards should be consulted for all applications. Issues such as handling of multi-block messages, optional replies, and others are described in detail in the SEMI specifications and are not a topic of this baseline recommendation. R1-5.4.4 The implementation for a specific equipment type begins by specifying which tasks that equipment is required to perform from the following list, and then studying the expanded descriptions for those tasks chosen in the SECS-II implementation section. Typical Tasks for Measurement and Process: 1. Measurement or Action Reports 2. Equipment Alarm Reports 3. Remote Request for Equipment Condition or State 4. Operator\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.4  SECS-II Standard (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.4  SECS-II Standard\n\nContent: Interface to the Host 5. Remote Access to Process Programs 6. Remote Commands Typical Tasks for Material Control and Transport: 1. Material Status Information 2. Material Transport Control Additional Tasks for Special Situations: 1. File Transfer\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.5  Baseline SECS Implementation Recommendations: SECS-I\n\nR1-5.5.1  The baseline SECS-I requirement for equipment is to fully implement the SECS-I protocol as defined in SEMI E4.  This requirement applies to all SECS compatible equipment independent of the equipment’s function.  The flow chart (Figure 2 of SEMI E4) illustrates the block transfer protocol of SECS-I.  The body of the SECS-I standard describes protocol timeouts and other requirements that are essential components of the specification.\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.6  Baseline SECS Implementation Recommendations: SECS-II (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.6  Baseline SECS Implementation Recommendations: SECS-II\n\nContent: R1-5.6.1 The SECS-II implementation begins with a choice or selection of messages for the equipment. In order for equipment to meet the baseline requirements for a viable SECS-II interface, the equipment must be capable of generating a certain set of messages and recognizing another set. The messages required for either set will depend on tasks of equipment and on system requirements for production and process control by the host. Equipment must accept S1,F1 and send S1,F2. Note that implementation in the reverse direction is optional. In order to ensure a viable data communication link, certain messages are required: Messages for All Equipment — Required by SECS-II a. Messages Generated by the Equipment S1,F2:On Line Data S9,F1: Unrecognized Device ID S9,F3: Unrecognized Stream Type S9,F5: Unrecognized Function Type S9,F7: Illegal Data b. Messages Recognized by the Equipment S1,F1: Are You There Request R1-5.6.2 In addition to those messages which are required, the\n\nSEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.6  Baseline SECS Implementation Recommendations: SECS-II (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E5-1104 SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT (SECS-II) - # R1-5.6  Baseline SECS Implementation Recommendations: SECS-II\n\nContent: following are strongly recommended. These messages are used for diagnostic purposes: Messages for All Equipment — Strongly Recommended A. Messages Generated by the Equipment 1. S2,F25: String Diagnostic Request B. Messages Recognized by the Equipment 1. S2,F26: String Diagnostic Data R1-5.6.3 Note that messages are identified by a “stream” number and a “function” number. All primary messages have an odd-numbered function, and the corresponding reply is the next consecutive evennumbered function. Thus, many messages are paired. For example, the Stream 1, Function 1 (S1,F1) message generated by either host of equipment has the reply of Stream 1, Function 2 (S1,F2). R1-5.6.4 Reports of Measurements or Process Actions — The simplest task for measurement and process equipment is to report their measurements or actions to the host.

Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on August 8, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org October 2003; to be published November 2003. Originally published in 1992; previously published July 2003.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: 1.1 Revision History — This is the first release of the GEM standard. 1.2 Scope — The scope of the GEM standard is limited to defining the behavior of semiconductor equipment as viewed through a communications link. The SEMI E5 (SECS-II) standard provides the definition of messages and related data items exchanged between host and equipment. The GEM standard defines which SECS-II messages should be used, in what situations, and what the resulting activity should be. Figure 1.1 illustrates the relationship of GEM, SECS-II and other communications alternatives. The GEM standard does NOT attempt to define the behavior of the host computer in the communications link. The host computer may initiate any GEM message scenario at any time and the equipment shall respond as described in the GEM standard. When a GEM message scenario is initiated by either the host or equipment, the equipment shall behave in the manner described in the GEM standard when the host uses the appropriate GEM messages. The capabilities\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: described in this standard are specifically designed to be independent of lower-level communications protocols and connection schemes (e.g., SECS-I, SMS, point-to-point, connection-oriented or connectionless). Use of those types of standards is not required or precluded by this standard. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use. 1.3 Intent — GEM defines a standard implementation of SECS-II for all semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The GEM standard defines a common set of equipment behavior and communications capabilities that provide the functionality and flexibility to support the manufacturing automation programs of semiconductor device manufacturers. Equipment suppliers may provide additional SECS-II functionality not included in GEM as long as the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: additional functionality does not conflict with any of the behavior or capabilities defined in GEM. Such additions may include SECS-II messages, collection events, alarms, remote command codes, processing states, variable data items (data values, status values or equipment constants), or other functionality that is unique to a class (etchers, steppers, etc.) or specific instance of equipment. GEM is intended to produce economic benefits for both device manufacturers and equipment suppliers. Equipment suppliers benefit from the ability to develop and market a single SECS-II interface that satisfies most customers. Device manufacturers benefit from the increased functionality and standardization of the SECS-II interface across all manufacturing equipment. This standardization reduces the cost of software development for both equipment suppliers and device manufacturers. By reducing costs and increasing functionality, device manufacturers can automate semiconductor factories more quickly and effectively. The\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: flexibility provided by the GEM standard also enables device manufacturers to implement unique automation solutions within a common industry framework. The GEM standard is intended to specify the following: A model of the behavior to be exhibited by semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a SECS-II communication environment, A description of information and control functions needed in a semiconductor manufacturing environment, A definition of the basic SECS-II communications capabilities of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, A single consistent means of accomplishing an action when SECS-II provides multiple possible methods, and Standard message dialogues necessary to achieve useful communications capabilities. The GEM standard contains two types of requirements: fundamental GEM requirements and requirements of additional GEM capabilities. The fundamental GEM requirements form the foundation of the GEM standard. The additional GEM capabilities provide functionality required for some types of factory\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: automation or functionality applicable to specific types of equipment. A detailed list of the fundamental GEM requirements and additional GEM capabilities can be found in Chapter 8, GEM Compliance. Figure 1.2 illustrates the components of the GEM standard. Equipment suppliers should work with their customers to determine which additional GEM capabilities should be implemented for a specific type of equipment. Because the capabilities defined in the GEM standard were specifically developed to meet the factory automation requirements of semiconductor manufacturers, it is anticipated that most device manufacturers will require most of the GEM capabilities that apply to a particular type of equipment. Some device manufacturers may not require all the GEM capabilities due to differences in their factory automation strategies. 1.4 Overview — The GEM standard is divided into sections as described below.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # Section 1 — Introduction\n\nThis section provides the revision history, scope and intent of the GEM standard.

State model components describing different aspects of machine control can be related to one another (example: processing state model with material transport state model; processing state model with internal machine safety systems). 3.1 State Model Methodology — To document the expected functionality of the various capabilities described in this document, the “Statechart” notation developed by David Harel has been adopted. An article by Harel is listed in Section 1.5 and should be considered “must” reading for a full\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: understanding of the notation. The convention used in this and following sections is to describe the dynamic functionality of a capability with three items: a textual description of each state or substate defined, a table that describes the possible transitions from one state to another, and a graphical figure that uses the symbols defined by Harel to illustrate the relationships of the states and transitions. The combination of these items define the state model for a system or component. A summary of the Harel notation and a more detailed description of the text, table, and figure used to define behavior with this methodology is contained in the Application Note A.5. The basic unit of a state model is the state. A state is a static set of conditions. If the conditions are met, the state is current. These conditions might involve sensor readings, switch positions, time of day, etc. Also part of a state definition is a description of reactions to specific stimuli (e.g., if message Sx,Fy is received,\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: generate reply message $\\mathrm { S x , F y + \\ 1 } ,$ ). Stimuli may be quite varied but for semiconductor equipment would include received SECS messages, expired timers, operator input at an equipment terminal, and changes in sensor readings. The benefits of providing state models are: 1. State machine models are a useful specification tool, 2. A host system can anticipate machine behavior based upon the state model, 3. End-users and equipment programmers have a common description of machine behavior from which to work, 4. “Legal” operations can be defined pertaining to any machine state, To help clarify the interpretation of this document and the state models described herein, it is useful to distinguish between a state and an event and the relationship of one to the other. An event is dynamic rather than static. It represents a change in conditions, or more specifically, the awareness of such a change. An event might involve a sensor reading exceeding a limit, a switch changing position, or a time\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: limit exceeded. A change to a new active state (state transition) must always be prompted by a change in conditions, and thus an event. In addition, a state transition may itself be termed an event. In fact, there are many events that may occur on an equipment, so it is important to classify events based on whether they can be detected and whether they are of interest. In this document, the term event has been more narrowly defined as a detectable occurrence that is significant to the equipment. A further narrowing of the definition of event is represented by the term “collection event,” which is an event (or group of related events) on the equipment that is considered significant to the host. It is these events that (if enabled) are reported to the host. By this definition, the list of collection events for an equipment would typically be only a subset of total events. The state models in this document are intended to be limited to the level of detail in which the host is interested. Thus, all state\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: transitions defined in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events. 3.2 Communications State Model The Communications State Model defines the behavior of the equipment in relation to the existence or absence of a communications link with the host. Section 4.1 expands on this section by defining the Establish Communications capability. This model pertains to a logical connection between equipment and host rather than a physical connection. 3.2.1 Terminology — The terms communication failure, connection transaction failure, and communication link are defined for use within this document only and should not be confused with the same or similar terms used elsewhere. See SEMI E4 (SECS-I) or SEMI E37 (HSMS) for a protocol specific definitions of communications failure. A connection transaction failure occurs when attempting to establish communications and is caused by a communication failure, the failure to receive an S1,F14 reply within a reply timeout limit, or receipt of\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: S1,F14 that has been improperly formatted or with COMMACK2 not set to 0. A reply timeout period begins after the successful transmission of a complete primary message for which a reply is expected. (See SEMI E4 (SECS-I) or SEMI E37 (HSMS) for a protocol-specific definition of reply timeout.) A communication link is established following the first successful completion of any one S1,F13/F14 transaction with an acknowledgement of “accept”. The establishment of this link is logical rather than physical. Implementations may have mechanisms which allow outgoing messages to be stored temporarily prior to being sent. The noun queue is used to cover such stored messages. They are queued when placed within the queue and are dequeued by removing them from this storage. Send includes “queue to send” or “begin the process of attempting to send” a message. It does not imply the successful completion of sending a message. The host may attempt to establish communications with equipment at any time due to the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: initialization of the host or by independent detection of a communications failure by the host. Thus, the host may initiate an S1,F13/F14 transaction at any time. 3.2.2 CommDelay Timer — The CommDelay timer represents an internal timer used to measure the interval between attempts to send S1,F13. The length of this interval is equal to the value in the EstablishCommunicationsTimeout. The CommDelay timer is not directly visible to the host. EstablishCommunicationsTimeout is the user-configurable equipment constant that defines the delay, in seconds, between attempts to send S1,F13. This value is used to initialize the CommDelay timer. The CommDelay timer is initialized to begin timing. The CommDelay timer is initialized only when the state WAIT DELAY is entered. The CommDelay timer is expired when it “times out,” and the time remaining in the interval between attempts to send is zero. When the timer expires during the state WAIT DELAY, it triggers a new attempt to send S1,F13 and the transition to the state\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3  State Models\n\nContent: WAIT CRA3 .\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.3  Conventions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.3  Conventions\n\nContent: The attempt to send S1,F13 is made only upon transit into the state WAIT CRA. The CommDelay Timer should be set to “expired” at this time. The CommDelay timer is initialized only upon transit into the state WAIT DELAY. A next attempt to send S1,F13 shall occur only upon a transit to the state WAIT CRA. 3.2.4 Communication States — There are two major states of SECS communication, DISABLED and ENABLED. The system default state must be userconfigurable at the equipment (e.g., via a jumper setting or non-volatile memory variable). Once system initialization has been achieved, the opera-tor shall be able to change the communication state selection at any time via equipment terminal functions or momentary switch. A two-position type switch must not be used due to possible conflict with the system default. The ENABLED state has two substates, NOT COMMUNICATING and COMMUNICATING, described below. The equipment must inform the operator of the current communication state via continuous display at the equipment,\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.3  Conventions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.3  Conventions\n\nContent: including the NOT COMMUNICATING and COMMUNICATING sub-states. In the event of a connection transaction failure, a userconfigurable equipment constant EstablishCommunicationsTimeout is used to establish the interval between attempts to send an S1,F13 (Establish Communications Request) while in the NOT COMMUNICATING substate. Figure 3.2.1 shows the relationship between the superstates and substates of the Communications State Model. A description of the events triggering state transitions and the actions taken is given in Table 3.2. The states of the Communications State Model are defined as follows:\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # DISABLED\n\nIn this state SECS-II communication with a host computer is non-existent. If the operator switches from ENABLED to DISABLED, all SECS-II communications must cease immediately. Any messages queued to send shall be discarded, and all further action on any open transactions and conversations shall be terminated.4 Handling of messages currently being transmitted is an issue for lower level message transfer protocols and is not addressed in this standard.  \nThe DISABLED state is a possible system default.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED\n\nENABLED has two substates, COMMUNICATING and NOT COMMUNICATING. Whenever communications are enabled, either during system initialization or through operator selection, the substate of NOT COMMUNICATING is active until communications are formally established. Lower-level protocols (such as SECS-I) are assumed to be functioning normally in that they are capable of supporting the communication of SECSII syntax.  \nThe ENABLED state is a possible system default.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/NOT COMMUNICATING\n\nNo messages other than S1,F13, S1,F14, and ${ \\bf { S 9 , F x } }$ shall be sent while this substate is active. The equipment shall discard any messages received from the host other than S1,F13 or S1,F14 (Establish Communications Acknowledge). It shall also periodically attempt to establish communication with a host computer by issuing an S1,F13 until communications are successfully established. However, only one equipment-initiated S1,F13 transaction may be open at any time.  \nThe NOT COMMUNICATING state has two AND substates, HOST-INITIATED CONNECT and EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT, both of which are active whenever the equipment is NOT COMMUNICATING. These two substates clarify the behavior of the equipment in the event that both the equipment and the host attempt to establish communications during the same period of time5 .\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NOT COMMUNICATING/EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT\n\nThis state has two substates, WAIT CRA and WAIT DELAY. Upon any entry to the NOT COMMUNICATING state, whenever EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT first becomes active, a transition to WAIT CRA occurs, the CommDelay timer is set to “expired,” and an immediate attempt to send S1,F13 is made.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NOT COMMUNICATING/EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT/WAIT CRA\n\nAn Establish Communications Request has been sent. The equipment waits for the host to acknowledge the request.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NOT COMMUNICATING/EQUIPMENT-INITIATED CONNECT/WAIT DELAY\n\nA connection transaction failure has occurred. The CommDelay timer has been initialized. The equipment waits for the timer to expire.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NOT COMMUNICATING/HOST-INITIATED CONNECT\n\nThis state describes the behavior of the equipment in response to a host-initiated S1,F13 while NOT COMMUNICATING is active.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NOT COMMUNICATING/HOST-INITIATED CONNECT/WAIT CR FROM HOST\n\nThe equipment waits for an S1,F13 from the host. If an S1,F13 is received, the equipment attempts to send an S1,F14 with $\\mathbf { C O M M A C K } = 0$ .\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/COMMUNICATING (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/COMMUNICATING\n\nContent: Communications have been established. The equipment may receive any message from the host, including S1,F13. When the equipment is COMMUNICATING, SECS communications with a host computer must be maintained. This state remains active until communications are disabled or a communication failure occurs. If the equipment receives S1,F13 from the host while in the COMMUNICATING substate, it should respond with S1,F14 with COMMACK set to zero. If the equipment receives S1,F14 from a previously sent S1,F13, no action is required. In the event of communication failure, the equipment shall return to the NOT COMMUNICATING substate and attempt to reestablish communications with the host. It is possible that the equipment may be waiting for an S1,F14 from the host in EQUIPMENT INITIATED CONNECT/WAIT CRA at the time an S1,F13 is received from the host in HOSTINITIATED CONNECT/WAIT CR FROM HOST. When this situation occurs, both equipment and host have an open S1,F13/S1,F14 transaction. Since communications are\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/COMMUNICATING (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/COMMUNICATING\n\nContent: successfully established on the successful completion of any S1,F13/S1,F14 transaction, either of these two transactions may be the first to complete successfully and to cause the transition from NOT COMMUNICATING state to COMMUNICATING. In this event, the other transaction shall remain open regardless of the transition to COMMUNICATING until it is closed in a normal manner. If the equipment has not yet sent6 an S1,F14 to a previously received S1,F13 at the time when COMMUNICATING becomes active, the S1,F14 response shall be sent in a normal manner. A failure to send the S1,F14 is then treated as any other communication failure. If the equipment-initiated S1,F13/S1,F14 is still open when the transition to COMMUNICATING occurs, subsequent failure to receive a reply from the host is considered a communication fault by equipment. An S9,F9 should be sent when a transaction timer timeout occurs7. (See Section 4.9 for definitions of communication faults and message faults, as well as detail on Stream 9\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/COMMUNICATING (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ENABLED/COMMUNICATING\n\nContent: Error Messages.)\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.5  State Transitions — Table 3.2 contains a full description of the state transitions depicted in Figure 3.2.1. (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.5  State Transitions — Table 3.2 contains a full description of the state transitions depicted in Figure 3.2.1.\n\nContent: When the operator switches from the DISABLED state to the ENABLED state, no collection event shall occur, since no messages can be sent until communications have been established. The process of establishing communications serves to notify the host that communications are ENABLED. No other collection events are defined for the Communications State Model. Table 3.2 Communications State Transition Table 3.3 Control State Model — The CONTROL state model defines the level of cooperation between the host and equipment. It also specifies how the operator may interact at the different levels of host control. While the COMMUNICATIONS state model addresses the ability for the host and equipment to exchange messages, the CONTROL model addresses the equipment’s responsibility to act upon messages that it receives. The CONTROL model provides the host with three basic levels of control. In the highest level (REMOTE), the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.5  State Transitions — Table 3.2 contains a full description of the state transitions depicted in Figure 3.2.1. (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 3.2.5  State Transitions — Table 3.2 contains a full description of the state transitions depicted in Figure 3.2.1.\n\nContent: host may control the equipment to the full extent possible. The middle level (LOCAL) allows the host full access to information, but places some limits on how the host can affect equipment operation. In the lowest level (OFF-LINE), the equipment allows no host control8 and only very limited information.9 The control model and communications model (when implemented) do not interact directly. That is, no action or state of one model directly causes a change in behavior of the other. It is true, however, that when the communication state is NOT COMMUNICATING then most message transaction are not functional. When messages cannot be transmitted, the control capabilities and all other GEM capabilities are affected. Refer to Figure 3.3 as the CONTROL substates and state transitions are defined.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE\n\nContent: When the OFF-LINE state is active, operation of the equipment is performed by the operator at the operator console. While the equipment is OFF-LINE, message transfer is possible. However the use of messaging for any automation purpose is severely restricted. While the OFF-LINE state is active, the equipment will only respond to those messages used for the establishment of communications or a host request to activate the ONLINE state. While OFF-LINE, the equipment will respond with an $^ { \\mathrm { S x , F 0 } }$ to any primary message from the host other than S1,F13 or S1,F17. It will process and respond to S1,F13 and S1,F17. S1,F17 is used by the host to request the equipment to transition to the ON-LINE state. The equipment will accept this request and send a positive response only when the HOST OFF-LINE state is active (see transition 11 definition below). While the OFF-LINE state is active, the equipment shall attempt to send no primary message other than S1,F13,10 S9,Fx,11 and S1,F1 (see ATTEMPT ONLINE\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE\n\nContent: substate). If the equipment receives a reply message from the host other than S1,F14 or S1,F2, this message is discarded. No messages enter the spool when the system is OFFLINE. Spooling may be active when the Communications State of NOT COMMUNICATING is active. This might occur during OFF-LINE, but since the equipment will not attempt to send messages except as mentioned in the previous paragraph12, no messages will enter the spool. OFF-LINE has three substates: EQUIPMENT OFFLINE, ATTEMPT ON-LINE, and HOST OFF-LINE.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE/EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE\n\nWhile this state is active, the system maintains the OFF-LINE state. It awaits operator instructions to attempt to go ON-LINE.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE/ATTEMPT ON-LINE\n\nWhile the ATTEMPT ON-LINE state is active, the equipment has responded to an operator instruction to attempt to go to the ON-LINE state. Upon activating this state, the equipment attempts to send an S1,F1 to the host.  \nNote that when this state is active, the system does not respond to operator actuation of either the ON-LINE or the OFF-LINE switch.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # OFF-LINE/HOST OFF-LINE\n\nWhile the HOST OFF-LINE state is active, the operator’s intent is that the equipment be ON-LINE. However, the host has not agreed. Entry to this state may be due to a failed attempt to go ON-LINE or to the host’s request that the equipment go OFF-LINE from ON-LINE (see the transition table for more detail). While this state is active, the equipment shall positively respond to any host’s request to go ON-LINE (S1,F17). Such a request shall be denied when the HOST OFFLINE state is not active.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE\n\nWhile the ON-LINE state is active, SECS-II messages may be exchanged and acted upon. Capabilities that may be available to the host should be similar to those available from the operator console wherever practical.  \nThe use of Sx,F0 messages is not required while the ON-LINE state is active. Their use is discouraged in this case. The only allowed use is to close open transactions in conjunction with message faults.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/LOCAL (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/LOCAL\n\nContent: Operation of the equipment is implemented by direct action of an operator. All operation commands shall be available for input at the local operator console of the equipment. The host shall have the following capabilities and restrictions when the LOCAL state is active: The host shall be prohibited from the use of remote commands that cause physical movement or which initiate processing. During processing, the host shall be prohibited from the use of any remote command that affects that process. During processing, the host shall be prohibited from modifying any equipment constants that affect that process. Other equipment constants shall be changeable during processing. The host shall be able to modify all available equipment constants when no processing is in progress. The host shall be capable of initiating the upload and download of recipes to/from the recipe storage area on the equipment. The host shall be capable of selecting recipes for execution so long as this action does not affect any currently\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/LOCAL (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/LOCAL\n\nContent: executing recipe. The host shall be able to configure automatic data reporting capabilities including alarms, event reporting, and trace data reporting. The host shall receive all such reports at the appropriate times. The host shall be able to inquire for data from the equipment, including status data, equipment constants, event reports, process program directories, and alarms. The equipment shall be able to perform Terminal Services as defined in GEM. The host shall be allowed any other capabilities that were not specifically restricted in the above items as long as the LOCAL state is active. NOTE 2: Capabilities mentioned above which are not implemented on a specific equipment may be ignored in this context.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE\n\nContent: For equipment which supports the GEM capability of remote control (see Section 4.4), while the REMOTE state is active, the host shall have access, through the communications interface, to the necessary commands to operate the equipment through the full process cycle in an automated manner. The equipment does not restrict any host capabilities when REMOTE is active. The degree of control executed by the host may vary from factory to factory. In some cases, the operator maybe required to interact during remotely controlled processes. This interaction may involve set-up operations, operator assist situations, and others. This state is intended to be flexible enough to accommodate these different situations. To support the different factory automation policies and procedures, it shall be possible to configure the equipment to restrict the operator in specific nonemergency procedures. These restrictions shall be configurable so that the equipment may be set up to allow the operator to perform necessary functions\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE\n\nContent: without contention with the host. The categories for configuration shall include (but are not limited to): change equipment constants (process-related), change equipment constants (non-process-related), initiate process program download, select process program, start process program, pause/resume process program, operator assist, material movement to/from equipment, equipment-specific commands (on a command-bycommand basis if needed). NOTE 3: Capabilities mentioned above which are not implemented on a specific equipment may be ignored in this context. No capabilities that are available to the operator when the LOCAL state is active should be unconditionally restricted when the REMOTE state is active. The supplier may provide for configurable restriction of operator capabilities not included in the list above if desired. No configurability is necessary for any operator functions not available to the host. The control functions must be shared to some degree between the host and the local operator. At the very\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE\n\nContent: least, the operator must have the capability to change the CONTROL state, actuate an Emergency Stop, and interrupt processing (e.g., STOP, ABORT, or PAUSE). All of these capabilities except Emergency Stop may be access-limited.13 The host software should be designed to be compatible with the capabilities allotted to the operator. Table 3.3 CONTROL State Transition Table NOTE 1: The configuration mentioned for transitions 1 and 2 should be a single setting. This would provide the user with a choice of entering th EQUIPMENT OFF-LINE, ATTEMPT ON-LINE, HOST OFF-LINE, or ON-LINE states. NOTE 2: Communication failures are protocol specific. Refer to the appropriate protocol standard (e.g., SEMI E4 or SEMI E37) for a protocolspecific definition of communication failure. NOTE 3: Any host initiated transaction open at the equipment must be completed. This may happen either by sending the appropriate reply to the host prior to sending the event message or by sending an $^ { \\mathrm { S x , F 0 } }$ message following\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE\n\nContent: the event message (i.e., after the transaction). 3.4 Equipment Processing States — The behavior of the equipment in the performance of its intended function must be documented. This processing state model is highly dependent on the equipment process, technology, and style. However, there are expected to be common aspects to these models. The Processing State Diagram, Figure 3.4, is provided as an example of an implementation model. This model demonstrates the expected nature of the processing state model documentation. There is no requirement that these specific states be implemented. The equipment must generate collection events for each processing state transition, as well as provide status variables (ProcessState, PreviousProcessState) whose values are the current processing state and the previous processing state. In referring to the Processing State Diagram, note that the initialization state INIT is not an actual processing state. It is shown here simply to indicate that the IDLE processing state is\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ON-LINE/REMOTE\n\nContent: entered upon completion of equipment system initialization.

Capabilities are operations performed by semiconductor manufacturing equipment. These operations are initiated through the communications interface using SECS-II messages. A scenario is a group of SECS-II messages arranged in a sequence to perform a capability. Other information may be included with the scenario for clarity. For each capability, the reader is provided with a statement of purpose, pertinent definitions, a detailed description, requirements, and scenarios. The following capabilities are discussed: Establish Communications Event Notification Dynamic Event Report Configuration Variable Data Collection Trace Data Collection Limits Monitoring Status Data Collection On-line Identification Alarm Management Remote Control Equipment Constants Process Program Management Material Movement Equipment Terminal Services Error Messages Clock Spooling Control 4.1 Establish\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4  Equipment Capabilities and Scenarios (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4  Equipment Capabilities and Scenarios\n\nContent: Communications — The Establish Communications capability provides a means of formally establishing communications following system initialization or any loss of communications between communicating partners, and thus of notifying the communication partner that a period of noncommunication has occurred. 4.1.1 Purpose — Communications between host and equipment are formally established through use of the Establish Communications Request/Establish Communications Acknowledge transaction. The use of S1,F1/F2 for this purpose is ambiguous since the transaction can be used for other purposes and may occur at any time. The S1,F13/F14 transaction, used in conjunction with the Communications State Model, provides a means for equipment to notify the host, or the host to notify the equipment, that there has been a period of inability to communicate. The successful completion of this transaction also signals a possible need for synchronization activities between host and equipment.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.2  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.2  Definitions\n\nContent: COMMACK — Acknowledge code returned in the Establish Communications Acknowledge message. See the SEMI E5 Standard for a full definition of this data item. EstablishCommunicationsTimeout — An equipment constant used to initialize the interval between attempts to re-send an Establish Communications Request. This value specifies the number of seconds for the interval. See the SEMI E5 Standard for a full definition of this variable data item. 4.1.3 Description — There are potential problems when one side of the communications link fails and the other side does not detect it. From the point of view of the host, a loss of communications has many possible causes. In some cases, host-controlled settings on the equipment may need to be reset. In other cases, the equipment may have continued an automatic processing sequence during the period of no communication and may have changed states. The definition of a formal protocol for establishing communications alerts the host to the need to synchronize itself with\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.2  Definitions\n\nContent: the equipment’s current status. Equipment shall consider communications as formally established whenever either of the following conditions have been satisfied:14 — Communications Request has been sent to the host and an Establish Communications Acknowledge has been received within the transaction timeout period and with an acknowledge code of Accept, or Communications Request has been received from the host, and an Establish Communications Acknowledge response has been successfully sent with an acknowledge code of Accept. When the equipment sends an Establish Communications Request to the host, this notifies the host of the possible need to synchronize itself with the equipment. When the equipment is attempting to establish communications, an Establish Communications Request shall be sent periodically until communications have been formally established as described above. The interval between attempts must be user-configurable and begins as soon as a connection transaction failure is detected (see\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.2  Definitions\n\nContent: Section 3.2). Attempting to establish communications is not a lowlevel connectivity issue, but rather a logical application issue used by either party to notify its partner that the host may need to perform synchronization activities with the equipment.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.4  Requirements\n\nEquipment must support the Communication State Model (see Section 3.2). Equipment must provide the EstablishCommunicationsTimeout equipment constant described above.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.5  Scenarios (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.5  Scenarios\n\nContent: 4.1.5.1 Host Attempts to Establish Communications COMMENT HOST EQUIPMENT Communications state is Enabled (any substate) Establish Communications S1,F13--> Request <--S1,F14 Reply COMMACK $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } =$ Accept and Communications state $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } = \\mathbf { \\Sigma }$ COMMUNICATING 4.1.5.2 Equipment Attempts to Establish Communications and Host Acknowledges COMMENT HOST EQUIPMENT COMMENT Communications State $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } = \\mathbf { \\Sigma }$ NOT COMMUNICATING [LOOP] [LOOP]--SEND <--S1,F13 Establish Communications Request Establish Communications S1,F14--> Acknowledge [IF] S1,F14 rcvd w/o timeouts [THEN] exit_loop--SEND [ELSE] Delay for interval in Establish CommuicationsTimeout [ENDIF] [END_LOOP]--SEND [IF] COMMACK $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } = \\mathbf { \\Sigma }$ Accept [THEN] Communications state $\\ c =$ Communicating exit_loop-- [ELSE] Reset timer for delay, and delay for interval specified in EstablishCommunications— Timeout [ENDIF] [END_LOOP] 4.1.5.3 Simultaneous Attempts to Establish\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.5  Scenarios (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.5  Scenarios\n\nContent: Communications — For equipment that supports interleaving, it is possible that either the host or equipment could send an Establish Communications Request before receiving the request from its partner. As communications are established by the successful acceptance of any one Establish Communications Request, it is immaterial who sends the request first. The roles of host and equipment may be reversed. Equipment Receives S1,F14 From Host Before Sending S1,F14: 4.2 Data Collection — Data collection allows the host to monitor equipment activity via event reporting, trace data reporting, limits monitoring, and query of selected status or other variable data. Event data collection may be broken into two logical parts: host notification when an event occurs and dynamic configuration of the data attached to the event notification. 4.2.1 Event Data Collection — Event data collection provides a dynamic and flexible method for the user to tailor the equipment to meet individual needs with respect to data\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.5  Scenarios (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.1.5  Scenarios\n\nContent: representation and presentation to the host. The event-based approach to data collection provides automatic notification to the host of equipment activities and is useful in monitoring the equipment and in maintaining synchronization with the equipment. 4.2.1.1 Event Notification — This section describes the method of notifying the host when equipment collection events occur. 4.2.1.1.1 Purpose — This capability provides data to the host at specified points in equipment operation. This asynchronous reporting eliminates the need for the host to poll the equipment for this information. Events on the equipment may trigger activity on the part of the host. Also, knowledge of the occurrence of events related to the equipment state models allows the host to track the equipment state. An equipment’s behavior is related to its current state. Thus, this capability helps the host understand how an equipment will behave and how it will react to host behavior.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.1.2  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.1.2  Definitions\n\nContent: Collection Event — An event (or grouping of related events) on the equipment that is considered significant to the host. Collection Event ID $) ( C E I D ) - \\mathbf { A }$ unique identifier of a collection event. See the SEMI E5 Standard for a full definition of this data item. Event — A detectable occurrence significant to the equipment. Report — A set of variables predefined by the equipment or defined by the host via S2,F33/F34. 4.2.1.1.3 Detailed Description — The equipment supplier must provide a set of predefined collection events. Specific collection events are required by individual capabilities and state models. Examples of collection events include: — The completion of each action initiated by a host requested command, — Selected processing and material handling activities, — Operator action detected by the equipment, — A state transition, — The setting or clearing of an alarm condition on the equipment, and — Exception conditions not considered alarms. See Section 6 for a list of\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.1.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.1.2  Definitions\n\nContent: required collection events. The reporting of a collection event may be disabled per event by the user to eliminate unwanted messages. An event report message shall be sent to the host upon the occurrence of a particular collection event if the collection event (CEID) has been enabled. Attached to each event message is one or more event reports which contain variable data. Section 4.2.1.2 describes the capability which allows for the dynamic customization of event reports. The values of any data contained in an event report message must be current upon the occurrence of the event. This implies that event reports be built at the time of the event occurrence. The equipment shall also provide the S6,F15/F16 transaction to allow the host to request the data from a specific event report.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.1.4  Requirements\n\n— The equipment supplier shall provide documentation of all collection events defined on the equipment and the conditions for each event to occur.  \n— The equipment supplier shall provide unique CEIDs for each of the various collection events that are available for reporting.  \n— The equipment supplier shall provide a method for enabling and disabling the reporting of each event. This method shall either be available via the host interface (see Section 4.2.1.2) or the equipment’s operator console.  \n— For each event, the equipment supplier shall provide either  \na default set of report(s) linked to the event which contain data pertinent to that event, or the ability for the user to configure the data linked to that event via the equipment’s operator console or host interface (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.1.5  Scenarios\n\nCollection Event Occurs on the Equipment:  \nHost requests an event report S6,F15--> <--S6,F16 Equipment sends event report.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.2  Dynamic Event Report Configuration — This section describes a capability which allows the host to dynamically modify the equipment event reporting setup.\n\n4.2.1.2.1  Purpose — This capability is defined to provide the data reporting flexibility required in some manufacturing environments. It allows the host to increase or decrease the data flow according to need. For example, if the performance of an equipment degrades, the data flow from that equipment may be increased to help diagnose the problem.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.2.2  Definitions\n\nEventsEnabled — A variable data item that consists of a list of currently enabled collection events (CEIDs).

NOTE 4: The equipment may also supply alternative means for defining reports and linking reports to events (e.g., via the operator console). Implementation of alternate means is not required. The equipment can be instructed by the host to enable or disable reporting of collection events on an individual or collective basis. A status value (SV) shall be available that consists of a list of enabled collection events. (See Section 5.2, Variable Item List, EventsEnabled variable.) Reports may be attached to an event report message (S6,F11). These reports are specifically linked to the desired event and typically contain variable data relating to that event. The reports may be provided\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.2.3  Detailed Description — The equipment shall support the following event report configuration functionality through the SECS-II interface: (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.2.3  Detailed Description — The equipment shall support the following event report configuration functionality through the SECS-II interface:\n\nContent: by the equipment supplier or created by the user. The user must be able to create reports and link them to events via the SECS-II interface.

Note that data values shall be valid and current on certain events and certain states and might not be current at other times. The implementor shall document when a data value will be current and available for reporting.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.2.4  Requirements\n\n— The equipment manufacturer must provide documentation of all variable data available from the equipment. This is to include variable name, variable type or class (SV, ECV, DVVAL), units, format codes, possible range of values, and a description of the meaning and use of this variable.  \n— The equipment manufacturer must provide unique VIDs for the various variable data (V) available for data collection in the equipment. For example, this means that no SV shall have a VID which is the same as the VID of any ECV or DVVAL.  \nAll variable data must be available for report definition and event data collection. See Section 5.2, Variable Item List, for a list of required variable data.  \n— All report definitions, report-to-event links, and enable/disable status of event reports must be retained in non-volatile storage.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.1.2.5  Scenario\n\nCollection Event Reporting Set-up:  \nCOMMENT HOST EQUIPMENT\n[IF] Define Report is Multi-block\n[THEN] send Multi-block inquire S2,F39--> <-- S2,F40 Multi-block grant.\n[ENDIF]\nSend report definitions S2,F33--> DATAIDs, RPTIDs, and VIDs received. <-- S2,F34 DRACK17 $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\mathit { \\Theta } 0$ the reports are OK\n[IF] Link Event/Report is Multi-block\n[THEN] send Multi-block inquire S2,F39--> <-- S2,F40 Multi-block grant.\n[ENDIF]\nLink reports to events S2,F35--> CEIDs and the corresponding RPTIDs are received.

It is assumed that the report has been previously defined (e.g., using the Define Report S2,F33 transaction (see Section 4.2.1)). The values of any status variables (SV’s) and equipment constants (ECV’s) contained within the report must be current. Discrete data values (DVVAL’s) are only guaranteed to be valid upon the occurrence of a specific collection event. If DVVAL cannot be specified in equipment due to some restrictions depend on hardware and/or software conditions, the zero length item is reported.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.2.4  Requirements\n\n— Variable data items (V’s) and associated units of measure must be provided by the equipment manufacturer.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.2.5  Scenario\n\nHost Requests Report: COMMENT\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # HOST EQUIPMENT\n\nHost requests data variables\ncontained in report RPTID S6,F19--> <--S6,F20 Equipment responds with a list of variable data for the given RPTID.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.3  Trace Data Collection\n\n4.2.3.1  Purpose — Trace data collection provides a method of sampling data on a periodic basis. The timebased approach to data collection is useful in tracking trends or repeated applications within a time window, or monitoring of continuous data.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.3.2  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: Data Sample Period (DSPER) — The time delay between samples.

The number of trace reports sent to the host is determined by total samples divided by reporting group size (TOTSMP/REPGSZ). The equipment shall sample the specified data (SV’s) at the interval designated by the host (DSPER) and shall send a predefined trace report to the host for the specified reporting group size (REPGSZ). The trace report definition shall be automatically deleted from the equipment after the last trace report has been sent. The host may modify or re-initiate a trace function currently in progress by specifying the same TRID in a trace request definition, at which point the old trace shall be terminated and the new trace shall be initiated, or the host can instruct the equipment to terminate a trace report prior to its completion by specifying $\\mathrm { T O T S M P } = 0$ for that TRID, at which\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.3.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: point the trace report definition shall be deleted.

The same SVID may be collected in multiple traces simultaneously.  \nAll SVID’s available at the equipment shall be supported for trace data collection. The exception to this is any SV that will not fit into a single block.  \nNOTE 5: SEMI E5 provides for SV’s to be of a list format. Since this may in practice be a variable list, there is a potential problem with such an SV supported by the Trace Data Collection capability. This is a problem with the SEMI E5 standard.

In some contexts it may be interpreted more narrowly as the combination of UPPERDB and LOWERDB. $L I M I T I D _ { n }$ — Refers to the identifier of a specific limit (as defined by UPPERDB and LOWERDB) among the set of limits for a monitored equipment variable. LIMITIDs are consecutively numbered, beginning at one through the number of limits possible (seven minimum). Monitoring Zone — A subset of the possible range of values for a variable of interest to the host. A single limit divides the range into two zones. Multiple limits may be combined to divide the range even further. Zone Transition — The movement of a variable value from one monitoring zone to another. This transition is a collection event and has a corresponding CEID. Deadband — An overlap of two zones implemented to prevent constant zone transitions by a\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: variable sitting on or near a limit (i.e., “chattering”). UPPERDB — A variable limit attribute that defines the upper boundary of the deadband of a limit.18 The value applies to a single limit (LIMITID) for a specified VID. Thus, UPPERDB and LOWERDB as a pair define a limit. LOWERDB — A variable limit attribute that defines the lower boundary of the deadband of a limit.18 The value applies to a single limit (LIMITID) for a specified VID. Thus, UPPERDB and LOWERDB as a pair define a limit. UPPER ZONE — The range of values lying above a limit. LOWERZONE — The range of values lying below a limit. LIMITMAX — The maximum value for any limits of a specific equipment variable. This value is set by the equipment manufacturer and typically coincides with the maximum value allowed for the monitored variable. LIMITMIN — The minimum value for any limits of a specific equipment variable.19 This value is set by the equipment manufacturer and typically coincides with the minimum value allowed for the monitored\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.2  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: variable. Undefined — When used in reference to variable limits, it indicates that monitoring/reporting of zone transitions involving that particular limit are disabled. 4.2.4.3 Description — The limits monitoring capability provides the host with a minimum of seven configurable limits or barriers that may be applied to selected equipment status variables (SV’s) of the types floating point, integer, and boolean. When one of these barriers is crossed, a collection event is generated to alert the host to a change in monitoring zone or state of the monitored variable. These seven limits may be combined in a variety of ways to match the needs of the host system.19 An illustration of a combination of five of the limits to provide one type of variable monitoring is shown in Figure 4.2.1.20 This section describes the key aspects of limits monitoring. Detailed implementation examples of limits monitoring are provided as Application Note A.7. NOTE 6: While the SEMI E5 standard allows SV’s to be lists, such\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.2  Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.2  Definitions\n\nContent: variable lists are not allowed under this capability. 4.2.4.3.1 Monitoring Limit Characteristics — A limit is defined by a set of attributes that include the variable (VID) to which the limit corresponds, the units of that variable, the maximum and minimum possible values of the limit (LIMITMAX and LIMITMIN) and the specific borders of the limit (UPPERDB and LOWERDB). See Figure 4.2.2. There is a limitation to the values of UPPERDB and LOWERDB which may be stated as:\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN\n\nContent: A limit divides the possible range of variable values into two parts, the upper zone and the lower zone. At any time, the monitored variable is considered to be in one and only one of these zones. However, as Figure 4.2.2 shows, these two zones have an area of overlap. This is called the deadband. The deadband is a key concept of limits monitoring, especially for floating point variables. Its purpose is to prevent a phenomenon known as chattering — the repeated changing of zones due to small, rapid fluctuations in variable value while near the zone boundary. In practice, the value of a variable must reach the opposite boundary of the deadband before a zone transition can occur. Thus, if a variable’s value reaches the UPPERDB and transitions into the upper zone, it will not return to the lower zone until it falls back to the LOWERDB. The difference between UPPERDB and LOWERDB should always be greater than the typical amplitude of those fluctuations deemed to be insignificant. In some\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN\n\nContent: cases, the width of the deadband may set to zero (i.e., UPPERDB $\\mathbf { \\sigma } = \\mathbf { \\sigma }$ LOWERDB). At first glance, this would seem to make indeterminate the current zone when an integer value sits on the limit. This is not the case, however, when movement of the value is considered. To illustrate, an example is given, assuming that UPPERDB $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } = \\mathbf { \\Sigma }$ $\\mathrm { L O W E R D B } = 1 0 0$ . The list shows consecutive readings of the variable and the resultant zone: 99 Lower Zone (Initial Reading) 101 Upper Zone (Zone Transition) 100 Lower Zone (Zone Transition) 100 Lower Zone 99 Lower Zone 100 Upper Zone (Zone Transition) Transition from one zone into another generates a collection event, as might be reported via S6,F11. The host has the option of receiving notification by enabling event reporting for the event. For each variable that has monitoring capability, one CEID is reserved to indicate zone transitions for that variable. To aid in the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN\n\nContent: determination of the nature of a transition event, three DVVAL’s have been defined: LimitVariable — The VID of the monitored variable to which the collection event refers. EventLimit — Contains the LIMITID of the limit reached or crossed by LimitVariable. TransitionType — Defines the direction of the zone transition which has occurred: $0 =$ transition from lower to upper zone, $1 =$ transition from upper to lower zone. Sampling frequency is an important element of limits monitoring and should be considered during equipment specification. If changes in variable value are relatively fast compared to sampling frequency, it is possible for some zone transitions to be missed or for multiple zone transitions to occur between readings. Since it is possible for zone transitions to occur “simultaneously” or for limits to be identically defined, the DVVAL EventLimit has been defined to allow for a list of multiple zone transitions of a variable to be reported with a single collection event. It\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN\n\nContent: also should be emphasized that a single CEID is used to report transitions in both directions across a limit. Thus, reporting for one direction but not the other cannot be configured. The functionality of each limit for each variable can be described with the state model shown in Figure 4.2.3. Below, the three states are described more fully, followed by a table defining the transitions.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # ABOVE LIMIT\n\nA variable is considered to be above a limit when its value increases to equal or exceed the upper boundary of the deadband, UPPERDB. The significance attached to this state is a function of the host’s usage.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # BELOW LIMIT\n\nA variable is considered to be below a limit when its value decreases to equal or fall below the lower boundary of the deadband, LOWERDB. The significance attached to this state is a function of the host’s usage.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NO ZONE (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NO ZONE\n\nContent: In some circumstances it is possible for the variable value to be in neither the upper zone nor the lower zone. This may occur upon definition of a new limit or upon equipment startup when the value of the variable lies in the deadband. In this case, the active state of the limit is considered to be NO ZONE. The limit shall remain in this state until the variable value reaches either boundary of the deadband. 4.2.4.3.2 Modification of Limit Values — Values for the monitoring limits on any monitored variable may be modified by the host using the message transaction S2,F45/F46 (Define Variable Limit Attributes). The equipment must reject any S2,F45 message which contains limit information which conflicts with the following rules: LIMITMAX≥UPPERDB≥LOWERDB≥LIMITMIN; If either UPPERDB or LOWERDB is defined, both must be defined; if either UPPERDB or LOWERDB is undefined, both must be undefined. The first rule is defined and graphically depicted in Figure 4.2.2. The second rule refers to the host’s ability to turn any\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NO ZONE (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # NO ZONE\n\nContent: limit “on” or “off”. While a minimum of seven limits must be available for each monitored variable, it will be common for the host application to require less than seven or even none of the limits be used. The limits not needed can be disabled by leaving the values for UPPERDB and LOWERDB “undefined”. Limits may be disabled for a VID or for all monitored VIDs by using zero length lists in the S2,F45 message. All monitored variables must be one of three types: integer, floating point, or Boolean. This may be accomplished by using the following formats: 11, 20, 3(), 4(), 5(). NOTE 7: The binary format is not allowed. If the ASCII format is used, the equipment shall perform a conversion into one of the numeric types before performing any value comparisons, both for limit validations and zone transitions. 4.2.4.3.3 Limit Values Request — The host may request the current limit values for a specified VID using the message transaction S2,F47/F48 (Variable Limit Attribute Request).\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.4.4  Requirements\n\nTable 4.2  Limit State Transition Table  \n— A minimum of seven limits per monitored variable must be available.\nOne CEID per monitored variable must be supplied for zone transition reporting.\nAll limit definitions must be kept in non-volatile storage.\n— The equipment must enforce the limit validation rules defined above.\n— The specification and documentation of which variables may be monitored with this capability is the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer based on the specific instance of equipment.

S1,F1--> <--S1,F2 Equipment replies with MDLN and SOFTREV. 4.3 Alarm Management — The alarm management capability provides for host notification and management of alarm conditions occurring on the equipment. 4.3.1 Purpose — Historically, a precise definition of an equipment alarm has been absent. Consequently, differing interpretations have resulted in inconsistent implementations. This is addressed by providing a more rigorous definition (see definition in Section 4.3.2 below) of an alarm. In addition, it is often important for equipment to report more extensive information to the host than has been available in the S5,F1/F2 (Alarm Report Send/ Acknowledge) transaction. The data required in such cases is very dependent on equipment type, host information requirements, and alarm situation. This issue is addressed by providing event reporting methods that are tied to alarm state changes. Lastly, the alarm management capability provides mechanisms for: — Reporting the\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.6.5  Scenario: (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.2.6.5  Scenario:\n\nContent: time of an alarm state change, — Uploading a list of alarm texts, — Enabling and disabling the notification of specific alarms, and Host query of alarms set and enabled status on the equipment.\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: Alarm — An alarm is related to any abnormal situation on the equipment that may endanger people, equipment, or material being processed. Such abnormal situations are defined by the equipment manufacturer based on physical safety limitations. Equipment activities potentially impacted by the presence of an alarm shall be inhibited. Note that exceeding control limits associated with process tolerance does not constitute an alarm nor do normal equipment events such as the start or completion of processing. AlarmsEnabled — Status value consisting of a list of the alarm ID’s currently enabled for reporting to the host. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable data item. AlarmsSet — Status value consisting of a list of the alarm ID’s currently in the ALARM SET (or unsafe) state. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this variable data item. ALCD — Alarm code data item used in the S5,F1 (Alarm Report Send) and S5,F6 (List Alarm Data) messages. This code is divided into two parts, the alarm set/cleared\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: bit and the 7 bit alarm category code. Only the set/cleared bit is used—bit $8 = 1$ means alarm set, $\\ c =$ 0 means alarm cleared. The alarm category code is not used. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this data item. ALID — Alarm identifier. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this data item. ALTX — Data item contained in the S5,F1 and S5,F6 messages containing a brief textual description of an alarm. See SEMI E5 for a full definition of this data item. 4.3.3 Detailed Description — Two alarm notification mechanisms are defined to achieve the flexibility necessary for the reporting required by host systems. First, stream 5 alarm reporting enables a brief, yet fixed, method for notification of alarm occurrences using the S5,F1/F2 transaction. Second, to address the host’s potential need for more extensive and flexible data reporting, two collection events (“alarm set” and “alarm cleared”) are defined for each possible alarm condition on the equipment to allow the use of event data collection\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: mechanisms. In the latter case, reports are sent by the equipment using the Event Report/ Acknowledge transaction (see Section 4.2 on event data collection). The $\\mathrm { a l a r m } _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ detected and cleared events are derived from the state model for an alarm (see Figure 4.3 and Table 4.3.1). In this model each of n alarms can be in one of two possible states, either ALARM CLEAR or ALARM SET. The transition from the ALARM CLEAR to the ALARM SET state is defined as the collection event ${ } ^ { 6 6 } \\mathrm { A l a r m } _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ detected” (transition 1). Conversely, the transition from ALARM SET to ALARM CLEAR is defined as the collection event $\\mathrm { \\cdot } _ { \\mathrm { A l a r m _ { n } } }$ cleared” (transition 2). NOTE 8: The alarm capability is intended as an addition to standard safety alarms (e.g., lights, horns). There is no intent to replace direct operator notification of such problems, nor is there the expectation that the host can prevent or directly\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: address such alarms. Table 4.3.1 Alarm State Transition Table The equipment manufacturer is responsible for identifying all alarms on their equipment by: — Applying the above alarm definition, — Consulting Application Note A.3 for examples of alarms for various equipment configurations, — Noting that the presence of an alarm typically requires some action or intervention before resuming safe operation of the equipment, and by — Referring to Table 4.3.2 below which delineates the differences between events and alarms. Table 4.3.2 4.3.3.1 Enable/Disable Alarms — Upon request from the host, the equipment shall enable or disable reporting of certain alarms. Enabling or disabling a given alarm shall impact the communication of both the alarm set and clear messages equally (i.e., turn them both on or both off). This is not the case for enabling/disabling of the associated collection events, where the alarm-set and alarm-cleared events can be enabled and disabled separately. The current enable/disable settings\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: must be stored in non-volatile memory. Changes to the enable/disable settings must be reflected in the AlarmsEnabled status value. NOTE 9: The alarm itself is not being enabled or disabled, but the reporting of the alarm through SECS-II messages is being enabled or disabled. 4.3.3.2 Send Alarm Report — Upon detecting a change in the status of a given alarm, an associated alarm state model shall transition to the opposite state. Following initiation of local actions necessary to ensure safety, the equipment must update the AlarmsSet and associated ALCD values and send an alarm message and/or an event message to the host assuming one or both are enabled. Alarm messages must be sent before the corresponding event messages if both are enabled. NOTE 10: The ALCD is divided into two parts, the alarm set/cleared bit and the 7 bit alarm category code. Only the set/cleared bit is used—bit $8 = 1$ means alarm set, $= 0$ means alarm cleared. The alarm category code is not used. 4.3.3.3 List Alarm Text — Upon\n\nSEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30-1103 GENERIC MODEL FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT (GEM) - # 4.3.2  Definitions\n\nContent: request from the host, the equipment sends values of alarm text associated with a specified list of alarm ID’s using the S5,F5/F6 (List Alarms Request/Data) transaction. 4.3.3.4 List Currently Set Alarms — The host may obtain a listing of currently set alarms by employing any data collection method specified by GEM and referencing the variable data item called “AlarmsSet” (e.g., including \" AlarmsSet in a report definition). When reported, AlarmsSet must contain a list of all currently set alarms. Each alarm set or clear occurrence must cause a change to the AlarmsSet status value prior to reporting it to the host. 4.3.3.5 List Currently Enabled Alarms — The host may obtain a listing of currently enabled alarms by employing any data collection method specified by GEM and referencing the variable data item called “AlarmsEnabled” (e.g., including AlarmsEnabled in a report definition). When reported, AlarmsEnabled must contain a list of all alarm ID’s currently enabled for reporting. The equipment must",
