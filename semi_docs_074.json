These specifications refer to the roughness of both the final polished front and the back surfaces of a wafer. Various techniques are currently used to measure the surface roughness of silicon wafers. These techniques include AFM scanning probes, mechanical and optical profiling, interferometric microscopes, and light (electromagnetic radiation) scattering. Mechanical profiling techniques are widely used in other industries and are well standardized. Profiling techniques are generally limited to line scans and therefore provide information of only a very small part of a surface. Interferometric techniques for roughness measurements are similarly limited, whereas light scattering techniques can scan the entire wafer surface. 4.2 Historically a variety of rough ness parameters for profiling techniques have evolved and have been standardized,"

The early (older) scanners generally had one detector measuring light from a very large solid angle collector. Later systems tend to use several smaller collection angles, each with their own detector.

The relationship between $P$ and the tolerance of the parts to be characterized $( T )$ is often called the $P / T$ Ratio.  SEMI M27 describes how to determine and interpret the factors: “A test instrument is usually deemed to be suitable for the purpose if $\\mathbf { P / T }$ lies below $10 \\%$ .  If $P / T$ is greater than $30 \\%$ , the test instrument is not likely to be suitable for the purpose.  Cases for which $P / T$ lies between $10 \\%$ and $30 \\%$ must be judged on an individual basis, depending on the requirements being placed on the measurement system.”"

Therefore a systematic, standardized approach is required for defining the roughness of the entire surface of a silicon wafer. This can be done by defining one or several patterns of measurement spots which represent the entire surface so that the deviation of the average roughness and its standard deviation from the “true” values are small. The task of finding such patterns and verifying that they represent the entire surface was approached in two steps: 1. by investigating various patterns on various wafer surfaces experimentally, and 2. by simulating the roughness map of surfaces and by applying the selected patterns to them. R1-1.2 Five different site patterns were used for the experimental investigation of silicon wafer surfaces which were final polished, stock removal polished and acid etched.

The 1-, 5- and 9-point site patterns were applied to the various maps and the average roughness and standard deviation of roughness were calculated as well as the true values using all points of a map. Strong effects were observed for the 1-point pattern. As expected one point in the wafer center does in general not represent the average roughness of the entire surface reasonably well. The 5- point measurement provides the correct average $\\pm 6 \\%$ , the 9-point measurement is $\\pm 2 . 5 \\%$ . Similarly, the 5- point standard deviation is correct $\\pm 1 . 6 \\%$ and the 9- point one is $\\pm 1 \\%$ . Second order effects were found to be smaller than the main effects.

The numerical result of a roughness measurement process depends significantly on several parameters such as spatial bandwidth of the response function of the tool used including filtering, scan length, probe diameter, scanning speed etc. These parameters are not independent of each other and have been standardized only for mechanical profilers (e.g.4,5). The roughness values reported by different types of tools usually do not agree but they correlate provided their parameters were set up not too differently (6). The standardized roughness metrics such as average roughness $\\mathrm { R _ { a } }$ or root-mean-square roughness $\\mathrm { R _ { q } }$ refer mainly to line scans as performed by profiling techniques (e.g. 7).

Performing many measurements using these site patterns is one approach to assess these site patterns with respect to their validity. Another approach is to simulate roughness variations across a wafer surface and apply the site patterns to them.

The variation observed on the different wafers is related to the specific polishing technique (wax mount polishing, wax free polishing) and to the polishing parameters used. Examination of haze maps reveals three basic patterns of variation: a) a circularly symmetric haze variation b) a haze variation approximately symmetric with respect to a diameter across the wafer c) a linear gradient of haze from one wafer edge to the opposite one. models a)-c) with e and c being the roughness values near the edge and at the center of a wafer, respectively: model a: a parabolic relation $z ( \\mathrm { x , y } ) = ( \\mathrm { x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } } ) ( \\mathrm { e - c } ) / \\mathrm { r ^ { 2 } + c }$ model b: a semi-cylindrical relation $\\mathrm { z ( x , y ) = ( r ^ { 2 } { - } ( y \\cos { \\it \\tilde { \\alpha } } a - x \\sin { \\it"

R1-5.4.3 The evaluation of the factorial design outlines that the variation of the variables c1, c2, e1, and e2 has a significant effect – with respect to “noise” – on the average roughness values but not on the corresponding standard deviations. Varying the surface model does not significantly affect the averages and standard deviations. Some second order effects or interactions are also significant but less pronounced than the main effects. A pronounced interaction of the variables c1 and c2 occurs e.g. for the five point standard deviation rstdabw5. This interaction could be reduced by introducing an additional site for measuring roughness in the center of the wafer with a direction perpendicular to the present one.

When the light is introduced into multi-layers of SOI wafers, reflection occurs on the surface of top silicon film and the front and backside of BOX. In such a case, the phase varies. The final intensities of the light that reflects from top silicon film surface are the sum of the intensity of light that reflects from each layer. The thickness of top silicon film and BOX makes optical path difference and then results in phase difference that is dependent on its wave length. The reflective light intensities, depending on its wavelength, are measured. The reflective spectra are defined"

Nanotopography is the non-planar deviation of the whole front wafer surface within a spatial wavelength range of approximately 0.2 to $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and within the fixed quality area (FQA). Typical examples include dips, bumps or waves on the wafer surface that vary in peak to valley height from a few nanometers to a several hundred nanometers. 2.2 This guide provides a framewo rk for communicating specific values limiting feature levels and/or densities as agreed upon between suppliers and users. 2.2.1 Discussion — Nanotopograph y measurements have not been needed for $0 . 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ generation devices, but are expected to be required for smaller feature sizes to meet CMP requirements.

Height variations over specified distances (determined by CMP issues and/or lithography systems) need to be properly controlled to assure that wafers are acceptable for selected process steps. In the case of CMP, the issue is control of film thickness variation introduced by nanotopography. The metrology industry is building tools that will measure and map surface features at nanotopography amplitudes and spatial wavelengths. Nanotopography features are characterized by their height variation within an area, and are discriminated from other features of similar height by their spatial wavelength range. 2.3 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use."

These include: 3.1.1 The finite surface spatial band width of the tool and the applied filtering will prevent surface variations outside the bandwidth of operation from being measured. Also, the finite bandwidth of filtering produces non-physical artifacts that may be apparent in regions where the power in the rejected bands is high. 3.1.2 Bandwidth edges are not alwa ys well defined. Measurement results do not always agree well between systems, because different tool designs employ different geometries and operate them over different spatial bandwidths. 3.1.3 All surface profiling measurem ent systems have a minimum height variation sensitivity that will distort signals near the noise floor. 3.1.4 The reported shape of some fe atures may also depend on the pixel grid orientation employed by the instrument. 3.1.5 The pixel size and sampled are a will affect the bandwidth limits. 3.2 Reported profiles also vary wi th interactions between"

    "content": "1.1  Over the years numerous calibration factors used to calculate the interstitial oxygen content of silicon from the peak room-temperature infrared absorption at $1 1 0 7 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ have been standardized by several standards development organizations in various parts of the world.  All such standards have since been revised to use the IOC-88 calibration factor1,2 that more correctly relates the true oxygen content of silicon to the absorption peak.  Nevertheless, many of the old calibration factors remain in common use throughout the industry.  \n1.2  This guide is a compilation of the conversion and calibration factors used in standards established by various organizations since 1970 for the measurement of interstitial oxygen in silicon."

Despite the fact that there is a test method associated with each calibration factor, the detailed procedures in these test methods are usually ignored in common practice and measurements are most frequently made with automated (black-box) instruments that have internal algorithms. Thus, reference to a particular standard"
