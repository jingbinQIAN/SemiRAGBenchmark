This leads to high efforts to specify the communication structures between Facility Package Units (FPU) and the Facility Monitoring and Control Systems (FMCS), to evaluate the quoted solutions and to eventually integrate these units. These individual, not standardized concepts today are not reusable, bear risks in execution and lead to high maintenance costs. 1.2.2 This specification is a first step to standardize the communication between facility and monitoring components. Therefore, it focuses in its scope to a small set of requirements which are common to all FPUs. As this communication concept is adopted by the various FPU suppliers and their customers, more specific standards describing particular FPUs and their services may evolve. 1.3 Who and what is addressed by this standard. 1.3.1 A standardization of the communication concept between FMCS and"

Proper venting is also critical to correct operation. The system may also include a reclaim pit, pumps, tanks, and controls. Separate holding tanks are used for each grade of water or type of waste stream so that routing of waste and types of treatment can be matched to specific needs (see Figure 1). 6.1.1 A key consideration for the design of a water reuse system is the ability to separate different grades of water and collect each type of effluent. Typical types of segregation include: segregation of clean rinse water from acid waste; separation of waste streams that contain organics, (e.g. from IPA drying); and isolation of waste streams that require specific treatment such as for hydrofluoric acid, CMP processing, copper solutions, or phosphoric acid. 6.1.2 A recent initiative by semiconductor"

Tool manufacturers can also incorporate plumbing and treatment modules for returning spent water discharged from a tool as feed water for that tool (Point of Discharge [POD] recycling). Purchasing tools with recycle hardware already built-in eliminates the need for users to design and install customized water reuse systems unique to their site. 6.2 Treatment of Waste Streams — In addition to choosing the most effective and technically sound design choices, other considerations for treatment choices include easy access to all major components for operations and maintenance, availability of consumables and spare parts, and a high level of automation and reliability.

This electric filed is oriented transverse to the direction of water flow through the ion exchange column. Under the influence of the applied electric field, impurity ions, chemically captured by the ion exchange reactions, drift from resin bead to neighboring resin bead and ultimately through a semipermeable membrane that isolates the feed water channel from adjacent circulating water flows (“concentrate channels”) that sweep away the impurities entering through the semipermeable membranes.

For reclaim systems, special types of high rejection or low fouling RO membranes may be selected. 6.2.5 Often RO Systems are combined with ion exchange processes either with the purpose of increasing the recovery rate of the RO or by combining the high efficiency of a membrane process with the lower fouling potential of ion exchange resins, e.g. Weakly Acidic Cation Resin (WAC) is designed to remove Ca and $\\mathbf { M g }$ ions in the water.

They can be either fixed bed systems or fluidized bed systems. These processes typically require both upstream and downstream processes, such as neutralization, and maintaining a stable feed concentration for the biological process upstream and removal of bacteria downstream.

The set points and level of monitoring depends on the chemistries being used and what the ionic and organic loads are in each waste stream after the application and the treatment.

Real time, on-line instruments are not available to easily quantify and identify the complete composition of the organic molecules for proper segregation. In addition, treatment of waste water containing organics is more difficult in some cases, depending on the organic molecules being removed or converted. 8.2 Managing Excursions — Excursions in reuse water quality can occur due to various reasons such as human error in operating non-automated manufacturing equipment. 8.2.1 It is important to detect and redirect such water before it can contaminate the system for which it directed for reuse or possibly even damage the treatment equipment. Excursions from organics are particularly difficult because they cannot be detected in real time.

This issue is influenced by seasonal variations in ambient temperature. Heat exchangers for process waters can be added to a recycle system in order to keep the system at a steady state. 8.4 Discharge Permits — One aspect of water reuse that can have significant economic impact relates to site effluent and local discharge permits. As water reuse increases, contaminant concentrations in the site effluent will also increase due to the reduced volume of the wastewater. If site water reuse is great enough, these higher concentrations may approach the limits of the local wastewater discharge permits and need to be closely monitored."

One type of savings can be measured from the actual cost of the water being replaced. The cost savings depends on the grade of water being replaced and the original cost of producing that grade of water at that location. Additional savings can often be realized in maintenance costs (e.g. membrane cleaning) given that the reclaim water is generally of better quality than incoming water. Models for evaluating the economics of a reclaim or recycle water application have been developed in the industry.
