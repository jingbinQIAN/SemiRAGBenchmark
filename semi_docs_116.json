If $Z ( n )$ is the measured profile, the detrended profile is given by: $$ \\begin{array} { r } { Z d ( n ) = Z ( n ) - [ a + b \\cdot n + c \\cdot n ^ { 2 } ] } \\end{array} $$ where the quantity in the square bracket is the quadratic detrending polynomial. The estimated values of the polynomial coefficients $a , b ,$ , and $c$ , denoted by $\\hat { a } , \\hat { b }$ , and $\\hat { c }$ , respectively, are determined by least-squares fitting of the polynomial to the measured profile data as now described. The degree of the detrending polynomial is chosen by the following considerations: Removing piston only (zeroth-order polynomial, $a$ ) is useful for"

Removing piston and tilt (first-order polynomial, $\\textit { a } \\ + \\ b { } \\cdot { } n )$ is sufficient for removing uncertainties in the rigid-body positioning of a nominally flat sample in the measurement apparatus. Removing piston, tilt and curvature (second-order polynomial, $a \\ + \\ b { \\cdot } n \\ + \\ c { \\cdot } n ^ { 2 } )$ removes an additional quadratic term in the profile that may result from instrumental (extrinsic) effects or true (intrinsic) curvature in the surface being measured. 5.1.2 Piston detrending is as follows: $$ \\widehat { Z } d ( n ) = Z ( n ) - \\widehat { a } $$ and $$ \\widehat { \\boldsymbol { a } } = + \\boldsymbol { M } _ { 0 } $$ where $M _ { 0 }$ (and also $M _ { 1 }$ and $M _ { 2 }$ ) are evaluated using the general moment expression, $$ { \\cal M } _ { P } = \\frac { 1 } { N } \\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } n ^ {"

    "content": "1.1  Organics are present in many materials, such as plastics, lubricants, cleansers, soaps, and living tissues. Some of these compounds are volatile and others can become airborne through chemical reactions, heating, abrasion, or outgassing.  Also they can transfer to wafers by direct contact or be left behind from solvent residues.  Once present in clean facilities, they can deposit on wafer surfaces.  Organics deposited on wafers can cause degradation haze, wafer surface tension changes, irregular oxidation rates, and other effects, such as counter-doping by organophosphorus compounds.  Identification of trace level organic contaminants is important in determining the source of the particular contamination.  These test methods use the TD-GC technique to characterize and quantify organics deposited on wafer surfaces.  \n1.2  Monitoring of organic contamination on wafer surfaces also can be used to measure material outgassing for proper selection of cleanroom, construction, and wafer packaging materials."

Similar SIMS effects have been well known for oxygen and even carbon in thermallyprocessed silicon.11 Figure 2 shows an expanded view of the carbon and nitrogen data taken from Figure 1. The vertical scale is linear. The unusually high nitrogen signal at about $3 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ may be one of these anomalous intensity spikes. The presence of such nonrandom signals, if significant, can make the averaging method used here"

Its value is dependent on the charge structure within and on the dielectric as well as at the silicon-dielectric $\\mathrm { ( S i – S i O _ { 2 } ) }$ interface. These charges consist of interface and bulk trapped and fixed charge, mobile charge distributed within the dielectric, and charge residing on the top of the dielectric. Although the total charge in and on the oxide determines flatband voltage, the charge near the silicon has the greatest effect. 1.4.1 Most device applications require that the mobile charge be minimized to provide stable threshold voltage. Stability of the charges at elevated temperatures is a measure of mobile charge density within the dielectric. The mobile charge changes location under temperature and electric field stress. The mobile charge density can be calculated from the resulting change in flatband voltage. 1.4.2 Equipment used to produce dielectrics can become contaminated in"

When such equipment becomes contaminated, it usually introduces an increased level of mobile ions into the dielectric. 1.4.3 Measuring $V _ { s u r f }$ or $V _ { c p d } ,$ , the contact potential between the probe and the semiconductor, with a Kelvin or Monroe probe allows a quantitative measurement of the charges associated with the semiconductor surface and the dielectric, independent of top (contact) electrode variations as in MOS C-V measurements. A special reference wafer has the mobile ions confined to the top half of the dielectric. It is therefore a good check of the Kelvin or Monroe probe, which is most sensitive to charges near the top of the dielectric. 1.5 The procedures in this practice can be used to ascertain that the dielectric characterization system(s) meet quality control requirements. They can be used as a training tool for tester applications. 1.6 The results obtained by these measurements can also be used to expose and troubleshoot"

They apply in general to dielectrics with charge structure that can be measured by the characterization system. Their applicability to dielectrics of less than 3-nm electrical oxide thickness depends on the capability of the NCDCS. A thickness correlation between the reference wafer(s) and thindielectric monitor wafers must be established. 2.1.1 The reference wafers must be designed to check the repeatability and functionality of all the parts and subsystems of the characterization system. Thermally oxidized wafers are not sufficient for this purpose because of parametric drift due to temperature-bias stressing and exposure to the atmosphere. 2.2 Three methods are described to cover various experimental arrangements (see Related Information 1 for a"

No other information is encrypted into the code. This allows the performance requirements of related bar code reading equipment to be simplified. In addition, provision is made for an optional alphanumeric marking of the size specified in SEMI M12 to enable operator identification of wafers. This alphanumeric code is not intended to be machine readable.

This specification allows for consistency of all wafer marking performed by wafer manufacturers. It may be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, the alphanumeric marking codes specified in SEMI M12 and SEMI M13 or a front surface bar code like that specified in SEMI T1. 2.2 Although this specification does not specify the marking techniques that may be employed when complying with its requirements, it is assumed that the symbol will be obtained by laser scribing individual dots. 2.3 The 2-D matrix code is applicable to a broad range of wafer products, including epitaxial wafers, SOI wafers, and unpatterned or"
