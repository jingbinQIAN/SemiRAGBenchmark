For protocol efficiency, A-LINK does not define layers 3 to 7.

This requires that the operator be able to enter certain information at the equipment’s console: a new state or substate request, and specific observed behavior that prompted the request. The host system is then notified that a change in state has occurred. 1.11 Integrated systems are able to provide more accurate data for those state changes than the equipment alone is able to detect.

The host requests an ARAMS state change by specifying an ARAMS Substate Code directly, while the operator selects a state and substate combination, through the human interface, that results in an ARAMS Substate Code.

This includes requirements for retaining data across a powerdown or reset. Data retention requirements are classified for each item of ARAMS data in one of the following ways: Class 1 — A “soft” value that is reset to a default value as part of system initialization (e.g., DowntimeAlarm) Class 2 — A “hard” value that never changes (e.g., “EqpSerialNum”) Class 3 — A “firm” value that changes infrequently and is to be retained in non-volatile memory (e.g., “EqpName”) Class 4 — A “dynamic” value that is retained in non-volatile memory and changes whenever an ARAMS state transition occurs. Class 5 — A “very dynamic” value that may change rapidly and is important to retain but does not require absolute accuracy (e.g., CycleCtr for high throughput equipment). Current values shall be saved in non-volatile memory periodically at least once per minute. 1.17.1 Except where otherwise specified, data is assumed to be Class 1. 1.17.2 Variables within each section are presented in alphabetical order. 11.1"

Operators have sometimes been known to log the equipment into UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME as a way of freeing time, even though the equipment is operating completely within specifications. R2-1.2 The equipment may use the status (read-only) ARAMSInfo to record information, such as Operator ID, that could be used in its defense. R2-1.3 Additionally, equipment is encouraged to maintain an internal log of events. While the host may or may not request ARAMSInfo in an event report, the equipment’s log could be used to record the information and would be accessible to field service personnel for analysis. Recording information such as the date, day of week, time of day, identifier of the operator (where known) could be an effective protection against abuse. NOTICE: SEMI makes no"

A framework is a software infrastructure that creates a common environment for integrating applications and sharing information in a given domain.

The Provisional Specification for CIM Framework Domain Architecture defines the structure, relationships and interworkings of the components that together comprise the CIM Framework. This architecture defines the partitioning of the CIM Framework components and the responsibilities of each of those components. It also specifies the common abstractions for manufacturing jobs, material, and factory resources that are used consistently throughout the CIM Framework as unifying themes. 2.2 The CIM Framework Domain Architecture does not address the dependencies on computing technologies needed to implement these components. These aspects apply more to the realization of the components as software artifacts than to their functionality in terms of semiconductor manufacturing concepts. The"
