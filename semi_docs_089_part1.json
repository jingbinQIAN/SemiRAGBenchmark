Then with the electronic switch in position 1, the value of $\\mathrm { v _ { F } }$ is measured. The switch is then moved to position 2 for a length of time equal to $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ and the value of $\\mathrm { I _ { H } }$ is measured. Finally, at the conclusion of\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 3  Test Operation (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 3  Test Operation\n\nContent: $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } } .$ , the switch is again moved to position 1 and the $\\mathrm { v _ { F } }$ value is measured within a time period defined by $\\mathbf { t } _ { \\mathrm { M D } }$ (or $\\mathbf { t } _ { \\mathrm { M D } }$ plus tSW, depending on the definitions stated previously).

The voltage and current waveforms for the two versions of Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2.\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: The procedures below describe how to set up the test conditions and determine the acceptance limits for implementing the transient thermal test for die attachment evaluation using the apparatus and definitions stated above. 4.1 Initial Device Testing Procedu re — The following steps describe in detail how to set up the apparatus described previously for proper testing of various integrated circuit devices. Step 1 — From a 10 to 15 piece sample of the integrated circuits to be tested, pick any one device to start the set-up process. Set up the test apparatus as follows: $\\mathrm { V _ { H } } = 5 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ (Or some other desired value near the device under tests (DUT’s) normal operating voltage.) $$ \\begin{array} { c } { \\mathbf { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } } = 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m s } } \\\\ { \\mathbf { t } _ { \\mathrm { M D } } = 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { u s } } \\end{array} $$ $\\mathrm { I _ { M } } = 1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m A }$ (Or some\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: other value appropriate for the specific device under test; typically in the range of $8 0 { \\mathrm { u A } }$ to $9 . 9 \\ \\mathrm { m A } .$ .) Step 2 — Insert device into the apparatus test fixture and initiate a test. (For best results, a test fixture that offers some form of heat sinking would be desirable.) Step 3 — If $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ is in the 20 to $4 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ range, then proceed to the next step. This range corresponds to a junction temperature change of roughly $1 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ to $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and is sufficient for initial comparison purposes. If $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ is less than $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ , return to Step 1 and increase heating power into device by increasing $\\mathrm { v _ { H } }$ , or by reconfiguring the DUT connections for greater power dissipation, or a combination of both. If $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: { F } }$ is greater than $8 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ , corresponding to a junction temperature change greater than $4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , it would probably be desirable to reduce the heating power by returning to Step 1 and reducing $\\mathrm { V _ { H } }$ , or by reconfiguring the DUT connections to reduce power dissipation, or a combination of the two. Reducing $\\mathrm { V _ { H } }$ is the preferable approach. Because two different devices can show the same rise in junction temperature, even if the value of $\\mathrm { \\bf P _ { H } }$ is different, a comparison of the devices is best accomplished using the CU value. As defined in Section 2 above, CU provides a comparison unit that takes into account different device $\\mathrm { I _ { H } }$ values for a given $\\mathrm { V _ { H } }$ test condition. Step 4 — Test each of the sample devices and record the $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ and CU data as shown in\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: Figure 3. Step 5 — Select out the devices with the highest and lowest values of CU and put the remaining devices aside. The $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ values can be used instead of CU if the measured values of $\\mathrm { I _ { H } }$ are very tightly grouped aroung the average value. Step 6 — Following the Heating Time $( \\mathrm { t _ { H } } )$ sequence shown in Figure 4, read and record the $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ and CU data values for each of the two devices of Step 5. Step 7 — Using the data from the previous step, prepare heating curves for the two devices in a manner similar to the examples shown in Figure 5. Step 8 — Interpretation of the heating curves is the next step. Realizing that the thermal characteristics of identical chips should be the same if the heating time $( \\mathrm { t _ { H } } )$ is less than or equal to the thermal time constant of the chip, the two curves should start\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: out the same for the low values of $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ . Non-identical chips (i.e., thinner or smaller in cross section) will have completely different curves, even at the smaller values of $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ . As the value of $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is increased, thereby overcoming the chip thermal constant, heat will have propagated through the chip into the die attachment region. Since the heating curve devices of Step 5 were specifically chosen for their difference, the curves of Figure 5 diverge after $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ reaches a value where the die attachment variance has an effect on the device junction temperature. Increasing $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ further will probably result in a flattening of the curve as the heating propagates in the device package. If the device package has little thermal mass and/or is not well mounted to a good heat\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: sink, the curve will not flatten very much, but will show a definite change in slope. Figure 6 shows the key elements of the heating curve. Step 9 — Using the heating curve, select the appropriate value of $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ to correspond to the inflection point in the transition region between heat in the chip and heat in the package. If there are several different elements in the heat flow path-chip, die attachment, substrate, substrate attachment, and package, for example, in a hybrid there will be several plateaus and transitions in the heating curve. Appropriate selection of $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ will optimize evaluation sensitivity to other attachment areas. Step 10 — Return to the apparatus and set $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ equal to the value determined from Step 9. Step 11 — Because the selected value of $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ is much less than that for thermal\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: equilibrium, it is possible to significantly increase the heating power without degrading or destroying the device. The increased power dissipation within the device under test will result in high $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ and/or CU values that will make determination of acceptable and non-acceptable devices much easier. Step 12 — The pass/fail limit, the cutoff point between acceptable and non-acceptable devices, can be established in a variety of ways: a) Correlation to other die attachment evaluation methods, such as die shear and/or $\\mathbf { x }$ -ray; while these two methods have little actual value from a thermal point of view, they do represent standardized methods as described in MIL-STD specifications. b) Maximum allowable junction temperature variation between devices; since the relationship between $\\Delta \\mathrm { T _ { J } }$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ is about $0 . 5 ^ { \\circ }\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: \\mathrm { C / m V }$ , the junction temperature spread between devicescan be easily determined. The $\\mathrm { T _ { J } }$ predicts reliability. Conversely, the $\\mathrm { T _ { J } }$ spread necessary to meet the reliability projections can be translated to a $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ and/or CU value for a Pass/Fail criteria, based on correlation with steady-state thermal equilibrium conditions. To fully use this approach, it will be necessary to calibrate the devices for the exact value of the $\\mathrm { ~ T _ { J } ~ - ~ V _ { F } ~ }$ characteristic. The characteristic’s slope, commonly referred to as K Factor, is easily measured on a sample basis using a voltmeter, environmental chamber, temperature indicator and a power supply setup for forcing, both active devices and thermal test chips as shown in Figure 7. A simple set of equations yields the junction temperature once $\\mathrm { K }$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm { V\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ are known: $$ \\begin{array} { l } { \\Delta \\mathrm { T } _ { \\mathrm { j } } = \\vert \\left( \\mathrm { K } \\right) \\left( \\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } } \\right) \\vert } \\\\ { \\mathrm { T } _ { \\mathrm { J } } = \\mathrm { T } _ { \\mathrm { A } } + \\Delta \\mathrm { T } _ { \\mathrm { j } } } \\end{array} $$ Where $\\mathrm { { T _ { A } } }$ is the ambient or reference temperature. c) Statistically from a moderate size device sample; the distribution of $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ or CU values should be a normal one with defective devices out of the normal range. Figure 8 shows a $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ distribution for a sample lot of integrated ciruits. Note that the left-hand side of the histogram envelope is fairly well-defined, but the other side is greatly skewed to the right. This comes about because the left-hand side is constrained by the absolutely best heat flow\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: that can be obtained with a given chip assembly material and process. The other side has no such constraints because there is no limit as to how poorly a chip is mounted. The usual rule of thumb in setting the maximum limit for $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ or CU is to use the distribution average value and one standard deviation ( σ) i.e. — $$ \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\left( \\Delta \\mathbf { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } } \\right) } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ h i g h } } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ l i m i t } } \\\\ & { \\left( \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { C } } \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { U } } \\right) } \\\\ & { \\left. \\mathrm { ~ h i g h } \\right| = \\overline { { \\boldsymbol { \\mathbf { C } } \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { U } } } } + \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { X } } \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { { c u } } } } \\\\ & { \\left. \\mathrm { ~ l i m i t } \\right| } \\end{array} $$ Where ${ \\mathrm { X } } = 1$ in most cases.

Step 13 — Once the test conditions and pass/fail limit have been determined, it is necessary only to record this information for future testing requirements of the same device in the same package. With the apparatus properly set-up, including the fail limit selector on those apparatus set ups so equipped, the operator need only insert the device, initiate a test, and then either read the $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ or CU display or observe the appropriate pass or fail indicaors. The steps listed hereto have been conveniently summarized in Figure 9. The total time required to perform these steps is greatly dependent on the operator but, in general, should require about one hour if the statistical approach of Step 12.C is used. 4.2 Routine Device Testing Proced ure — Once the proper control settings have been determined for a particular device type from a given\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Test Procedure\n\nContent: manufacturing process or vendor, repeated testing of that device type simply requires that the same test conditions be used as previously determined. New device types or the same devices manufactured with a different process will require a repeat of Section 4.1. 4.3 Comparison of Different Vend or Devices — Each device type is defined as a specific chip manufactured to a given set of procedures. Integrated circuit users who buy a specific part number from more than one vendor or manufacturers that redesign or otherwise modify the fabrication of their devices will be able to use the heating power and approximately the same $\\mathfrak { t } _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ for all vendors, but probably will have to use a different $\\Delta \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } }$ or CU pass/fail limit for each different vendor because the K Factor for parts manufactured by different vendors will probably be different.

After a suitable radius has been formed at the shoulder, there must be no compound angle formation to achieve the lead spread requirements. Lead Bend Angle may just be a reference if Lead Spread is specified (see Figures 1A, B, C). 3.4 Lead Coplanarity — the vertic al position of a lead foot with respect to a reference plane created by the three leads with feet most extended from the bottom surface of the package body. The term “foot” applies to both PLCC foot radii and PQFP feet (see Figure 2). 2.2 Reference Documents 3.5 Lead Shoulder (Dambar Area) Protrusions or Intrusions — a protrusion (tab) on the shoulder or lead, or intrusion cut into the\n\nSEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 3  Selected Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 3  Selected Definitions\n\nContent: shoulder or lead as a result of dambar trimming (see Figures 3 and 4). 3.6 Lead Sweep — lead movemen t measured with respect to a datum, perpendicular to the top or bottom surface of the package and which passes through the midpoint of the lead, when viewed from the sides of the package (see Figure 4). 3.7 Mismatch — misalignment be tween the top and bottom cavities. The measurement of mismatch is stated as the difference between the center lines of the top and bottom cavities (see Figure 5). All statements regarding mismatch of cavities are applicable to both the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ and $\\mathrm { Y }$ axis. All measurements are made prior to lead trim and form. 3.8 Offset — the difference in the bottom cavity position from a leadframe datum when compared to design (see Figure 6). This measurement ignores leadframe tolerances. All statements regarding offset are applicable to both the X and Y axis. All measurements are made prior to lead trim and form. 3.9\n\nSEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 3  Selected Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 3  Selected Definitions\n\nContent: Overlap — the difference in le ngth or width between the top and bottom cavities. Overlap may be a feature designed into the mold to avoid mismatch (see Figure 5). All statements regarding overlap of cavities are applicable to both the X and Y axis. All measurements are made prior to lead trim and form. 3.10 Package Warpage — loss of planarity of a molded surface excluding protrusions and intrusions (see Figure 7). Each package type has a maximum allowable warpage and a warp factor is used to determine the maximum warpage for a particular package dimension. The Warp Factor (WF) is defined as follows: $$ { \\mathrm { W F } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { T o t a l ~ W a r p ~ i n ~ i n c h e s ~ ( m m ) } \\times 1 0 0 0 } { \\mathrm { P a c k a g e ~ d i m e n s i o n ~ i n ~ i n c h e s ~ ( m m ) } } } $$ Package warpage is usually caused by incorrect package design and/or poor molding conditions. 3.11 Parting Line Protrusions, or In trusions — plastic excesses (flash) or\n\nSEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 3  Selected Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 3  Selected Definitions\n\nContent: losses (chips or voids) at the parting line after normal processing to mold, deflash, trim, and singulate the packages. 3.12 Surface Protrusions or Intrusi ons — plastic excesses (bumps or blisters) or recesses (pits or voids) on any surface of the package.\n\nSEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 4  Ordering Information (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G52-90 (Reapproved 1104) STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF IONIC CONTAMINATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR LEADFRAMES (PROPOSED) - # 4  Ordering Information\n\nContent: Purchase orders for molded plastic tooling furnished to this document, shall include the following items: 4.1 A package tooling outline drawing showing all the required dimensions listed in Section 5.

Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on July 23, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004. Originally published in 1993.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 1  Preface\n\n1.1  Use — This test may be used for process control and outgoing inspection at the supplier or by the user for incoming inspection.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This method describes the standard method for measuring the brightness of silver plating on semiconductor leadframes.  \nNOTE 1:  This method determines quantitative measures which are not related directly to the traditional “Dull,” “SemiBright” and “Bright” descriptors for silver plating.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 3.1  SEMI Standard\n\nSEMI G21 — Specification for Plating Integrated Circuit Leadframes  \n3.2  JIS Specifications  \nJIS H8621 — Electroplated Coatings of Silver for Engineering Use  \nJIS Z8722 — Method of Measurement for Color of Reflecting or Transmitting Objects  \nJIS Z8741 — Method of Measurement for Specular Glossiness  \n3.3  Military and Federal Specifications2  \nQQ-S-365 General Requirements for Electrodeposited Silver Plating  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 4  Significance\n\n4.1  Brightness values indicate surface roughness for given plating conditions. Surface roughness affects the wettability of resinous die attach processes on leadframes. If the surface is too smooth, poor wetting may occur which results in low die share strength values.  \n4.2  Brightness variations may also affect the ability of the pattern recognition systems used on assembly equipment to recognize the set points.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 5  Summary of Method\n\n5.1  The method is based on the use of a GAM Densitometer. This method is chosen as the standard because of the small measurement area requirements and the high accuracy of the method for typical silver plating brightness used on leadframes.  \n5.1.1  This method is based on the measurement of the reflectance of light at $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ from a surface illuminated from a light source perpendicular to the surface. This value of Reflectance (R) gives a Density Value (D) based on the following formula:  \n$\\mathrm { D } = \\log \\ 1 / \\mathrm { R }$ Density is a measure of the Brightness.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 6.1  Surface Finish\n\n6.1.1  Brightness values depend on surface roughness. A rough surface shows a low brightness value when compared to a smooth surface. Variable plating conditions, such as the addition of brighteners to the plating solution, may give brightness results, which are not comparable for the acceptance of plated leadframes.  \n6.1.2  Scratches and other flaws in the surface will affect reflectance.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 6.2  Storage Time and Conditions\n\n6.2.1  Figure 1 shows the brightness results for leadframes subjected to indoor, atmospheric storage for  \nan extended time. Results are shown for silver plating on copper alloy and Alloy 42 leadframes.  \n6.2.2  Leadframes shall be stored in conditions agreed between supplier and customer in order to limit atmospheric tarnishing, and brightness measurements shall be taken within an agreed time of delivery.  \n6.3  Degradation of the standards will affect calibration.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 7  Equipment\n\n7.1  GAM Densitometer or equivalent.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 8  Sampling\n\n8.1  A sampling plan shall be agreed between user and supplier.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 9  Preparation of Samples\n\n$9 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { N o }$ special preparation requirements are necessary. Do not contaminate the samples by touching with bare hands.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 10  Measurement Conditions\n\n10.1  To confirm the lamp is on enough to measure the brightness values. (Lamp intensity is automatically calibrated.)\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 11.1  Equipment Setup\n\n11.1.1  Set up and turn on the equipment according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  \n11.1.2  Allow at least 30 minutes for equipment stabilization before beginning measurements.\n\nSEMI G55-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING BRIGHTNESS - # 11.2  Calibration\n\n11.2.1  Calibration shall be performed using standard black and white plates.  \n11.2.2  The equipment shall be recalibrated every 30 minutes.",
