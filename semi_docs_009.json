This step, while clearly necessary, is unlikely to be sufficient to guarantee meeting the NTRS requirements of the future. Steps to minimize environmental particle concentration, $c$ , and time of exposure, t, will have to be part of the strategy for creating acceptable processing environments.

Static charge on a conductive or static dissipative object can be easily controlled if the object is provided with a path for the charge to flow to earth ground.

Additionally, the Automated Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability Standard (ARAMS) SEMI E58 can be used for equipment with ARAMS capability. Productivity metrics for flexible-sequence cluster tools require tracking of SEMI E10 equipment states and recipes at the level of individual processing modules.

Because theoretical production time per unit may vary widely by recipe, good throughput performance may not indicate correspondingly good performance in terms of overall equipment efficiency. Similarly, a high OEE score may not be indicative of high throughput. Given this disparity, it is essential that both metrics be analyzed and compared as separate entities. R2-2.2 Data from rapid characterization experiments may be displayed graphically on a Productivity Effectiveness Plane (PEP) diagram, Figure R2-1. R2-2.3 In PEP diagrams, IEE is plotted as a function of throughput. Points that appear further to the right have higher throughput and points that appear higher up have higher IEE. It is desired to have combined equipment and process designs whose performance would appear in the upper right quadrant of the plane for the entire operating range of the tool. R2-2.4 The four"

This curve is referred to as a tool signature. R2-2.5 Tool signatures may be used to describe tool performance relative to isolated variables. This representation helps equipment suppliers and users visualize the effects of tool operating modes on IEE and throughput. For more complex multi-dimensional experiment sets, the tool signature would appear as a hyper-surface. R2-2.6 OEE can be plotted for comparison against tool signatures. In Figure R2-1, an OEE measurement of a typical week is plotted. For the known throughput corresponding to this OEE score, the value of IEE on the tool signature for the same throughput may be used to approximate the IEE score for the week without calculating IEE explicitly.

The parallel input/output (PI/O) control signals between the production equipment and the AMHS must be better defined for more reliable and efficient carrier handoffs (load/unload) at production equipment load ports.  \n1.2  The purpose of this specification is to enhance the capabilities of the parallel I/O interface defined in SEMI E23 in order to support improvements in the reliability and efficiency of carrier transfer. The enhanced capabilities include continuous handoff, simultaneous handoff, and the capabilities of error detection on the interface.  \nNOTE 1:  The specifications in this document shall be considered independent from the specifications in SEMI E23; therefore use of this specification does not require SEMI E23."

In addition, the CONT signal is used to indicate a continuous handoff. In the sequence shown in Figure 10, the carrier on the load port is unloaded first, and a new carrier is loaded on the load port. The CONT signal is turned ON at the time of active equipment BUSY ON of the first handoff to indicate that the handoff is continuous. In successive load sequences, the same load port number (CS_0 in this example) is specified to use the same load port. In this example, there are no more carriers that are to be transferred after the second load sequence, therefore the active equipment turns the CONT signal OFF when the BUSY signal is turned ON in the second handoff to indicate the continuous handoff is complete. 6.2.6.4 Continuous handoff sequence for handoffs at different load ports (Lo"
