    "content": "R4-4.2.1  When component damage or equipment problems due to ESD are suspected, it may be useful to detect the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by the ESD event. This type of testing is both a starting point for determining that static charge has been generated, and it is a measurement point to ascertain that any static control methods have been successful. EMI locators measure dynamic operating conditions, as it is usually not necessary to interrupt equipment operations to make measurements."

In its simplest form, it consists of an AM radio tuned off station. A popping noise will be heard when an ESD event occurs. At the most complex it consists of a wideband (greater than 1 GHz) digital storage oscilloscope with a set of appropriate antennas, probes, and software. Measurements of radiated interference can be made using antennas while probes can be connected to equipment parts or electronics and power lines. R4-4.3.2 An oscilloscope attached to a single antenna can assist in pinpointing the actual location of the ESD event.8, 9, 10, 11 A set of antennas can be used to not only detect the presence of an ESD event, but to determine the location of the pulse in 3 dimensions.12, 13 Using the same concept as a global positioning system (GPS), the difference in the arrival times of the signal to multiple antennas is directly related to the difference in the distance of each antenna from the ESD source.

R4-4.3.3 Several other types of EMI locating equipment are currently in use. Most consist of high frequency receiving circuitry followed by level detectors to determine the magnitude of the signal. For the purpose of detecting EMI from ESD events, the equipment should have some way of differentiating the short impulse of EMI from the ESD event from the continuous high frequency radiation of other EMI sources. Some instruments contain a counter to total the number of ESD events above the threshold, or alarms to indicate when the number of ESD events exceeds a preset number. This type of instrument can be placed near a piece of equipment that is suspected of causing ESD events and left in place to monitor. R4-4.3.4 Several EMI Locators are battery-operated handheld devices that can be easily carried around a facility or placed directly in equipment to check for ESD events. This allows"

    "content": "R4-4.4.1  One caution needs to be observed when using EMI locators to detect ESD events that cause component damage. The signal received by these devices is generated in areas usually surrounded by grounded metal components. It may have to pass through equipment panels and travel some distance through the air before it reaches the detector. There may  \nbe other radio frequency sources and reflecting or absorbing materials in the area. The actual location of the ESD event may be a considerable distance from the EMI locator. It will be difficult to establish any correlation between the amplitude of the signal received by the EMI locator and the energy in the ESD event that produced the signal. The EMI locator primarily indicates the occurrence of an ESD event and can be used to illustrate that a particular static control method has eliminated it. It should not be assumed that every ESD event detected results in damage to components or equipment problems. Additional testing will be needed to establish that connection."

    "content": "R4-5.1  Static event detectors (SED) are devices that are installed directly on products to detect the presence of an ESD event. They may be attached in proximity to an ESD-sensitive component, connected to the external device leads, or integrated into the device package. Typically they detect the current pulse of an ESD event through an antenna or direct connection to the device circuitry.  \nR4-5.2 SEDs can be useful in determining the occurrence of ESD events in operating production equipment. The SED has the ability to indicate ESD events of a known level, aiding in the design and performance verification of automated equipment. While costly analysis of failed devices can also provide this information, correlation to machine operations is usually difficult. An SED that can be monitored optically as it passes through operating equipment provides a convenient method to verify that automated equipment is not generating levels of static charge that result in ESD damage."

The SED is designed to trip at a predetermined threshold voltage, detecting ESD transients above the selected amplitude. Some devices can be reset magnetically or optically making them reusable. R4-5.3.2 Other devices use the controllable ESD damage threshold of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET). The test methodology is to amplify an ESD transient to create sufficient energy to destroy the gate oxide. The device may be used until the specified ESD level is achieved, and then the SED fails. A similar device is based on the metal oxide semiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP). The current leakage through the device significantly increases if the ESD amplitude is sufficient to damage the MOS structure. Both of these types of SED must be removed from where they are installed and require additional instrumentation to determine their status. R4-5.3.3 Another"

The liquid reaction products are collected by rolling a DI water droplet over the whole wafer surface using up to $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\textmu L }$ for advisable machine operation or an appropriate volume for manual operation. Any cross contamination is minimized by using DI water as solvent. 8.4 Collection Procedure — An automatic scanning procedure is preferable, but if the collection procedure is manual the following procedure should be used. 8.4.1 Use appropriate method to exclude the wafer edge. 8.4.2 A droplet of collecting agent, usually ultra-pure hydrofluoric acid or another reagent or a combination of reagents, is rolled"

The contamination is measured directly from the silicon surface. Three important aspects are covered: a. Contamination due to the minienvironment alone, b. Contamination from the use of minienvironments for wafer processing, and c. Contamination from future materials to be used in semiconductor technology. 5.2 Silicon wafers are either place d in the minienvironment or used for headspace sampling experiments. The sample is heated and the target compound is either desorbed or outgassed. These compounds are swept by the carrier gas into the Ion Molecule Reactor. Here the molecules are chemically ionized under atmospheric pressure. The target ions are separated in a drift cell by electrophoreses in the gaseous state and detected by an electrometer. Additionally, a quadrupole mass spectrometer could be used as a second detector. The result"

The FOUP can be clamped onto the kinematic couplings by inserting an oblong head on a shaft (not specified here) through the slot and rotating it $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ in either direction. Either retaining feature would only engage after the FOUP is fully seated on the kinematic coupling pins. Either retaining feature must be able to withstand a force in any direction of at least $f 6 0$ . It is recommended that SEMI E15.1 tool load ports be designed to accommodate the minimum hole dimensions of the retaining features to ensure carrier interchangeability. Projections on the tool"

Figures 5 through 8 also show front clamp flanges and exclusion volumes (defined by x62, y60, y61, $z 6 6$ , z67, $z 6 8$ , and $z 6 9$ ) behind them that can be used to clamp the FOUP to the FOUP opener when the FOUP is purged with Nitrogen. However, it is strongly recommended that the front clamp flanges not be used for pulling the FOUP from the undocked position into the FIMS interface. Also, all of the dimensions of the FOUP (such as the wafer location, etc.) are defined with reference to the kinematic coupling pins, and most FOUPs are designed so that all of the features are in the proper location only when the FOUP is held in place on the kinematic coupling pins only by gravity. Thus, if the front clamp flanges are used, the wafers and the FOUP features may be in a different position than defined in SEMI E1.9 (possibly resulting in damage to wafers,"

All required convex features may also have a radius of up to $r 6 6$ to prevent small contact patches with large stresses that might cause wear and particles.
