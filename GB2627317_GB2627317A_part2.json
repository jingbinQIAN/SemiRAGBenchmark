The heat dissipation structure may include several dissipation means such as thermal pins 36 in the chiplet; a redistribution layer, RDL, 12 that has contacts that do not provide electrical device signals; and a plurality of metal layers 52 within the wafer. The chiplet and wafer may also have a passivation layer 34. This structure can be used for heat management after micro transfer print process.\n\nTechnical field\n\nThe present invention concerns semiconductor structures and in particular semiconductor structures comprising a heat dissipation structure. More and more applications nowadays require high linearity, high power handling, low noise figure and low power consumption. As these requirements are in most cases antagonistic, they are very hard to achieve in MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) circuitry. For that reason, it is common to use system in package (SiP) techniques to enclose in a single module several integrated circuits from several technologies, to benefit from the best of each one of them. Dies will then be connected together using bonding wires or bumps. This SiP technique allows a system level integration of several dies/technologies. GaN is a relatively new technology compared to other semiconductors, such as Si and GaAs, but it has become the technology of choice for high-RF, power-hungry applications like those required to transmit signals over long distances or at high-end power levels. GaN transistors provide high power density, high operating temperatures, improved efficiency, low on-resistance, and they can be operated in different frequency bands ranging from 1 GHz to 110GHz. Silicon on insulator (SOI) technology is used in semiconductor manufacturing, especially microelectronics, to reduce parasitic capacitance by having a layered silicon-insulator- silicon substrate structure (rather than bulk Si). SOl CMOS provides lower power consumption for analogue and digital RF mixed circuits in the design of low power RF transceivers thanks to its low leakage capabilities. To achieve some of the advantages of both GaN and SOI, attempts have been made to grow GaN on SOl, using trench etching to isolate GaN transistors. Alternatively, micro- transfer printing [1] can be used to transfer a GaN device from a native/source wafer to a target SOI wafer. In this process, the GaN device is detached/lifted from the native wafer it was grown on and re-attached on the SOI wafer. The SOI devices as well as the Gal transistors are fabricated separately in their process environments and can have different wafer diameters. Most of the circuit can be designed on SOI technology while relatively few transistors are micro-transfer printed on top of the SOI wafer. [1] R.

Aspects of the present invention provide a semiconductor structure, a system and method of forming a semiconductor structure as set out in the appended claims. Embodiments of the invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.\n\n15 Brief description of drawings\n\nFigure 1 shows a sequence of steps for releasing a chiplet during micro-transfer printing process; Figure 2 shows a schematic cross section of a semiconductor structure; Figure 3 shows a schematic cross section of a semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 4 shows a schematic top view of a semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 5 shows a schematic top view of another semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 6 shows a schematic cross section of another semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 7 shows a schematic cross section of another semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 8 shows a schematic cross section of another semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 9 shows a schematic cross section of a semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipations structure; Figure 10 shows a schematic perspective view of a semiconductor structure comprising a heat dissipation structure; Figure 11 shows a circuit diagram of a SPDT switch; and Figure 12 shows a circuit diagram of micro-transfer printed transistor connected to a target wafer.\n\nDetailed description\n\nMicro-transfer printing (UTP) enables monolithic designs with shorter interconnections, which can prevent losses and transitions between chips and_ substrates. Interconnections are provided directly between the two stacked chips with metal (e.g. thick copper) a.k.a. redistribution layer (RDL). When micro-transfer printing, one or more chiplets is lifted from the native substrate and attached to the target wafer. A chiplet, as mentioned above, is a (small) piece of chip for which the native substrate has been removed. A potential problem with transfer printed technology is the thermal dissipation from the transfer printed chiplet, which can lead to thermal breakdown of components at lower powers and thus limit the power handling capability of the components. The transfer printed chiplet is thermally isolated from the target substrate, and conventional technology of using through silicon vias (TSVs) to direct the heat off-wafer are not compatible with micro-transfer printed technology. 25 Embodiments described herein can at least partly solve this problem by improving the heat transfer from the chiplet. Figure 1 illustrates some of the steps of a transfer printing process by releasing a chiplet 2 (e.g. a GaN chiplet) from a native silicon substrate 4. (A) The passivation layer 6 and the dielectric layers 8 of the backend stack 10 are etched to reveal the underlying active layer 14 (a.k.a. device layer) around the chiplet 2. (B) An etch (e.g. a GaN etch) is then performed to isolate the chiplet 2, followed by (C) deposition of an encapsulation layer 16 (e.g. SIN) to protect the chiplet 2. (D) The encapsulation layer 16 is etched to reveal the top metal 18 of the chiplet 2 for forming connections to the target wafer (not shown) after transfer printing. (E) Another etch is performed around the chiplet to reveal the underlying silicon substrate 4, followed by (F) the release of the chiplet 2 by etching the silicon substrate 4 underneath the chiplet 2. After release, the chiplet 2 can be transferred and attached to a target wafer (e.g. a SOI wafer). As part of the attachment process, an adhesion enhancing layer may be provided on the target wafer. For example, a glue layer may be deposited on the target wafer before providing the chiplet on the target wafer. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of a cross section of a part of a semiconductor structure 1 comprising a chiplet 2 being a GaN chiplet, attached to a target wafer 20 being a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer. The same reference numerals have been used in different figures to denote equivalent or similar features in order to aid understanding and are not intended to limit the illustrated embodiments. The chiplet 2 comprises an active layer 14, comprising one or more semiconductor devices such as transistors, dielectric layer 8, a first passivation layer 6, and a second passivation layer 16. The chiplet 2 is attached to the target wafer 20 by an adhesion enhancing layer 22 being a glue layer (e.g. comprising Benzocyclobutene, BCB). A redistribution layer (RDL) 12 electrically connects the chiplet to the target wafer 20. In particular, the RDL 12 connects the top metal layer 18 of the chiplet 2 to a metal pad 24 (e.g. an aluminium pad) at the surface of the target wafer 20. The RDL may have a thickness of 3 um. The target wafer 20 comprises an upper silicon layer 26 (e.g. an epitaxial layer) and a silicon substrate 28 separated by a buried oxide (BOX) layer 30. The wafer 20 comprises a passivation layer 32 (e.g. SION) covering the upper silicon layer 26. The upper silicon layer 26 of the SOI wafer 20 is illustrated as a single layer but comprises the back-end comprising metal layers, dielectric layers to separate the metallization, and an active silicon layer for forming semiconductor devices in the SOI wafer. The passivation layer 32 is opened to expose the metal pad 24. The structure, comprising both the chiplet, RDL 12 and SOI 20 Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of a cross section of a part of another semiconductor structure 1. In addition to the features illustrated in Figure 2, the semiconductor structure 1 comprises a thermal pin 36. The thermal pin 36 comprises a part of the top metal layer 18 of the chiplet 2 and a via 38 connected to that part of the top metal layer 18 and terminating at or close to the active layer 14 of the chiplet 2. The active layer 14 can comprises one or more semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors) of the chiplet 2, which dissipate heat during use. The thermal pin 36 is arranged to transfer heat from the active layer 14 to a part of the RDL 12, thereby reducing the temperature build up in the chiplet 2. That part of the RDL 12 is in turn connected to an interface structure 42 comprising a connection pad 43 located in an opening in the passivation layer 34. An electronic package such as a PCB (not shown) can be connected to the RDL 12 via the interface structure 42. Preferably, the electronic package comprises a heat sink that is configured to be connected to the RDL 12 and thermal pin 36 via the interface structure 42. For example, the semiconductor structure 1 can be thermally connected to the electronic package by soldering, or wire bonding. While the RDL 12 is also used for electrically connecting the chiplet 2 to the wafer 20, the part of the RDL 12 connected to the thermal pin 36 has no electrical connections in the chiplet 2 or in the wafer 20 and can be left floating. That is, while other parts of the RDL 12 are electrically connected to semiconductor devices in the active layer 14 of the chiplet 2 at one end, and to other semiconductor devices and/or passive devices in the target wafer 20 at the other end, the part of the RDL 12 connected to the thermal pin 36 is part of a heat dissipation structure, which is not used for electrical connections. In other embodiments, the heat dissipation structure can be grounded. The heat dissipation structure further comprises the third passivation layer 34, which comprises a thick layer of aluminium nitride (AIN). The passivation layer 34 may have a thickness greater than 5 um, e.g. 7 um. The dielectric passivation layer 16 and of the chiplet 2 may also comprise AIN to further increase the heat transfer from the chiplet 2. In other embodiments, a different Figure 4 shows a schematic top view of a part of a semiconductor structure 1, such as the part shown in Figure 2 or Figure 3. The structure 1 comprises a transistor 44 comprising a gate pin 46, source pin 48 and a drain pin 50. Each pin is connected to a corresponding part of the RDL 12a-c, which connects the transistor 44 to the wafer 20. The structure 1 further comprises a thermal pin 36 connected to another part of the RDL 12d. This part of the RDL 12d may have a relatively larger surface area compared to the other parts 12a-d in order to lower the thermal resistance. The part of the RDL 12d connected to the thermal pin 36 is not electrically connected to any of the other parts of the RDL 12a-c and can be left floating. Figure 5 shows a schematic top view of a part of a semiconductor structure 1 comprising multiple thermal pins 36. Similar to the structure 1 illustrated in Figure 4, the structure 1 comprises a transistor 44 comprising a gate pin 46, source pin 48 and a drain pin 50. Each pin is connected to a corresponding part of the RDL 12a-c, which connects the transistor 44 to the wafer 20. The structure 1 further comprises five thermal pins 36 connected to other parts of the RDL 12d-f. These parts can be electrically connected to each other, but not to the pins 46, 48 and 50. Figure 6 shows a schematic diagram of a cross section of a part of another semiconductor structure 1. In addition to the features of the structure 1 illustrated in Figure 3, the heat dissipation structure further comprises a plurality of metal layers 52 in the upper silicon layer 26 of the target SOI wafer 20 and connected by vias 54. The metal layers 52 further increase the total cross sectional area of thermally conductive material between the chiplet 2 and the interface structure 42. For example, the combined height/thickness of the RDL and the plurality of metal layers 54 may be greater than 10 um, e.g. 12 um. The target SOI wafer 20 comprises a plurality of metal pads 24 in openings of the passivation layer 32 connecting the plurality of metal layers 52 to the RDL 12 and thereby indirectly to the thermal pin 36. In use, heat is conducted from the thermal pin 36 to the RDL 12, from the RDL 12 to the plurality of metal layers 52 in the target SO! wafer 20, and from the plurality of metal layers 52 to the connection pad 43 of the interface structure 42. Only a part of each metal layer 52 may form a part of the heat dissipation structure, while other parts may be used to connect to semiconductor devices in the SOI wafer. Hence, the heat dissipation structure comprises a part of the backend stack of the target SOI wafer 20. Figure 7 shows a schematic diagram of a cross section of a part of another semiconductor structure 1. The semiconductor structure 1 is similar to the one illustrated in Figure 6, but comprises a through silicon via (TSV) 56 connected to the plurality of metal layers 52 in the wafer 20. The TSV 56 is a part of the interface structure 42 to which a PCB or other external component can be connected. The TSV 56 allows heat to be transferred from the chiplet 2 via the RDL 12 and metal layers 52 off the wafer 20. Figure 8 shows a schematic diagram of a cross section of a part of another semiconductor structure 1, wherein the interface structure 42 comprises both a connection pad 43 in an opening in the top passivation 34 to allow connection to the RDL 12 and a TSV 56 connected to the plurality of metal layers 52 of the target wafer 20. The top passivation 34 comprises a thick (e.g. 7 um) AIN layer to further increase the heat transfer from the chiplet 2. Figure 8 also shows a solder bump 58 connected to the RDL 12 via the connection pad 43 and forming part of the interface structure 42 for connecting to a PCB (not shown). Figure 9 illustrates a part of another semiconductor structure, wherein the thermal pin 36 is not connected to the metal RDL 12, but instead directly to a layer of AIN 60. The AIN layer 60 may be the top passivation layer 34 or may be covered by the top passivation layer 34. The AIN layer 60 is connected to a connection pad 43 of an interface structure 42 for connecting to a PCB or other electronic package with solder bump 58 and for transferring heat off the wafer. The AIN layer 60 may also be in contact with the RDL 12 (not shown in Figure 9), to further increase the thermal conductivity between the chiplet 2 and the interface structure 42.. The second passivation layer 16 on the chiplet 2 may also comprise AIN, in order to further lower the thermal resistance between then chiplet 2 and the interface structure 42. Figure 10 shows a schematic perspective view of a semiconductor structure 1, comprising a chiplet 2 comprising a transistor 44 and gate, source and drain pins 46, 48 and 50 for connecting to the corresponding terminals of the transistor 44. The chiplet 2 is attached to a SOI wafer 20 by a glue layer 22. The glue layer 22 can reduce heat dissipation from the transistor 44, and the chiplet therefore comprises a heat dissipation structure 62 comprising a thermal pin 36 located in the chiplet 2 and a thermally conductive path 64 connected to the thermal pin 36 at one end and to an interface structure 42 comprising a copper pillar at the other end. The thermally conductive path may comprise a part of a RDL layer or a thermally conductive dielectric layer (e.g. comprising AIN). Figure 11 shows a circuit diagram of single pole double throw (SPDT) switch circuit comprising a semiconductor structure as described herein. The heat dissipation structure, can increase the maximum power handling of the SPDT before thermal breakdown occurs. The regions indicated by dashed lines include circuit components from one or more chiplets that have been micro-transfer printed onto the RF-SOI wafer. Figure 12 shows a circuit diagram of a circuit 66 comprising a semiconductor structure as described herein. The circuit comprises a transistor 44 and thermal pin 36 (in the chiplet) and input and output impedance matching elements for connections to the target wafer. The circuit 66 can be part of a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and can be connected to the SPDT illustrated in Figure 11. In general, embodiments described herein can provide a semiconductor structure comprising a wafer, a chiplet attached to the wafer, an comprising a semiconductor device (e.g. a transistor) and one or more metal layers connected to the semiconductor device, an interface structure for connecting to the wafer, and a heat dissipation structure for transferring heat from the chiplet to the interface structure. There may be limited heat transfer through the bottom of the chiplet into the wafer, and the heat dissipation structure can prevent thermal build up and breakdown by increasing the heat transfer from the chiplet. The chiplet is typically attached to the wafer by an adhesion enhancing layer such as a glue layer and may comprise at least one of Benzocyclobutene (BCB) anda photodielectric material such as InterVia™. The chiplet may be a GaN chiplet comprising one or more GaN devices, such as field effects transistors (FETs) or binary junction transistors (BUTs). In other embodiments, the chiplet comprise one of GaAs, SiC and InP. The wafer may be a silicon on insulator (SOl) wafer. The interface structure may comprise a through silicon via (TSV) though a buried oxide (BOX) layer of the SOI wafer. The semiconductor structure may be comprised by a single pole double throw (SPDT) switch circuit. The heat dissipation structure may comprise a thermal pin located in the chiplet and comprising a part of a top metal layer of the one or more metal layers of the chiplet and a via connected to the part of the top metal layer. The via terminates at or close to the active layer of the chiplet (close to the one or more semiconductor devices) in order to transfer heat dissipated by the semiconductor device(s). The heat dissipation structure can comprise a plurality of thermal pins in the chiplet. Each thermal pin may comprise a single or a plurality of vias to the active layer. The heat dissipation structure may comprise at least a part of a dummy metal layer comprised by a top metal layer of the one or more metal layers of the chiplet. “Dummy” in this context refers to the fact that the dummy metal layer is not used to form any electrical connections, and does not (significantly) affect the final device performance. The semiconductor device normally comprises a device metal layer for electrical connections to the semiconductor device (i.e. for electrical connections to doped regions in the active layer), and the dummy metal layer does not contact the device metal layer. Both the dummy metal layer and the device metal layer may advantageously be formed in the top metal layer of the backend stack of the semiconductor device, and are separated when patterning the top metal layer. The dummy metal layer forms no electrical connections but increases the mechanical strength of the chiplet, and can thereby reduce warping and prevent cracking during the micro-transfer printing process. The dummy metal layer may be part of or connected to one or more thermal pins in the chiplet. The dummy metal layer can have a thickness in the range of 0.3 um to 4m, and preferably a thickness of 1.25 um, which can provide sufficient mechanical strength. Advantageous properties in terms of mechanical strength of the chiplet have been found for a dummy metal layer having a thickness in the range of 1 um to 2 um. For example, the gap between the dummy metal layer and the device metal layer can have a width of at least 10 um, to avoid capacitive effects that could negatively affect device performance. For devices operating at frequencies below 5 GHz, a smaller gap may be used, while for high frequency applications (e.g. > 20 GHz) a gap of at least 30 um may be preferable. For GaN transistors, the device metal layer comprises metal contacts such as source, drain and gate contacts. The dummy metal layer and the device metal layer can be arranged so that metal is substantially uniformly distributed on the chiplet. Uniformly distributing the metal across the chiplet can improve the mechanical properties of the chiplet and further reduce the occurrence of defects during micro-transfer printing. For this purpose, the dummy metal layer may also be substantially symmetrically arranged on the chiplet. The dummy metal layer and/or the device metal layer may have x and/or y symmetry. To increase the mechanical strength of the chiplet, it may be advantageous to cover a large proportion of the surface area of the chiplet with metal. The dummy metal layer and the device metal layer may together cover between 20% and 90% of the total surface area of the chiplet. The heat dissipation structure may comprise a part of a redistribution layer (RDL) connected to the chiplet. The RDL may comprise metal lines (e.g. Cu) having a thickness in the range of 1 um to 5 um. Alternatively or in addition, the heat dissipation structure may comprise a dielectric layer that is thermally conductive (e.g. AIN). For example, the heat dissipation structure may comprise a part of the top passivation. The dielectric material may be a ceramic based on aluminium, such as AlzO3 or AIN, which have good chemical stability and a low thermal expansion coefficient (close to that of silicon). Different processes may be used to form the dielectric layer. For example, an alumina nanocomposite with good thermal conductivity may be formed as described in Kumari et al. [2] by chemical vapour deposition and spark plasma sintering. Alternatively, Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) may be used to form the dielectric layer. Such a process is described in T.E.S. Araujo et. al. [3]. PEO can be an environmentally friendly and cheap process of forming an oxide coating on a lightweight metal. The process comprises applying a DC voltage to a sample in an electrolytic solution. Under lower voltages, mainly oxygen-containing ions are attracted to the sample, causing the formation of an insulating oxide layer on the surface. The voltage is then increased to form complex structures involving species on the substrate and the coating. The coatings may have good adhesion and also resistance to corrosion. [2] L. Kumari, T. Zhang, G.H. Du, et. al. Compos. Sci. Technol. 68 (9) (2008) 2178-2183. [3] Tamires E.S. Araujo, Marcos Macias Mier, Alfredo Cruz Orea, Elidiane C. Rangel Nilson C. Cruz, Materials Letter: X 3 (2019) 100016. The wafer typically comprises a plurality of metal layers, such as the back end of line (BEOL) metals (M1, M2, M3, .., Mrop). The plurality of metal layers may be connected to the active silicon layer (a.k.a. device layer) of the wafer to form and provide connections to semiconductor devices in the wafer. The heat dissipation structure can comprise a part of one or more of the metal layers. For example, the heat dissipation structure can comprise a part of each metal layer of the plurality of metal layers, wherein the parts are connected by vias. This can allow improved heat transfer through the wafer to the interface structure. The heat dissipation structure may further comprise a passivation layer comprised by the chiplet. For example, the top passivation layer (also known as encapsulation layer) of the chiplet may comprise a thermally conductive material such as AIN. The interface structure may comprise a connection pad in an opening in a passivation layer on the wafer. Typically, the interface structure comprises a connection to the RDL, in order to allow bonding to semiconductor structure. For example, the interface structure may comprise at least one of a connection pad, a solder bump, a wire bond, a copper pillar and a through silicon via, TSV. For example, the interface structure may comprise a TSV for connecting to a first side of the wafer and a connection pad for connecting to a second, opposite side of the wafer. An electronic package comprising a heat sink can then be connected to the semiconductor structure via the interface structure. The semiconductor structure may comprise a plurality of passivation layers comprising a first passivation layer comprised by the wafer, wherein the chiplet is attached to the first passivation layer, a second passivation layer comprised by the chiplet, and a third passivation layer covering the chiplet and the wafer. Other embodiments provide a system comprising a semiconductor structure as described above and a printed circuit board, PCB, connected to the semiconductor structure by the interface structure. The system further comprises a heat sink attached to the PCB for dissipating heat transferred via the interface structure. Also described herein is a method of forming a semiconductor structure. The method comprises providing a chiplet comprising one or more semiconductor devices and a thermal pin comprising a part of a top metal layer of the chiplet and a via connected to the part of the top metal layer, attaching the chiplet to a target wafer, forming a redistribution layer (RDL), and forming a passivation layer covering at least a part of the RDL. For example, the step of providing the chiplet may comprise a micro-transfer printing process, wherein the chiplet is lifted from its native substrate. The chiplet may be covered by a passivation layer before lifting. The passivation layer may comprise a thermally conductive dielectric material such as AIN.
