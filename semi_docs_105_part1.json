It should be noted however, that unlike silane, DCS is not expected to autoignite in almost all ambient conditions where we would find it in use. For fire protection purposes it can be treated as a highly flammable gas. 6.2 Risk Management Strategies Fundamental concepts of safety and accident prevention are: 6.2.1 An understanding of facilities, piping and equipment, from storage to gas abatement, is essential for safe handling of silane family gases in semiconductor or FPD manufacturing facilities. 6.2.2 The safety of facilities can be enhanced by implementation of designs for sources, piping and equipment that use devices with fail-safe, foolproof, self-diagnostic and predictive functions. 6.2.3 Safety systems should detect current safety status and generate notices that indicate conditions of elevated risk, through computer self-diagnosis and dedicated SSCS devices. If the SSCSs cannot confirm normal operation of assigned silane family gas handling system or\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 6  General Principles (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 6  General Principles\n\nContent: unit, the silane family gas supply should automatically be shut off. 6.2.3.1 SSCSs can determine if a safe status has been achieved before proceeding to the next step in a silane family gas handling process. 6.2.3.2 SSCSs should be provided in distribution facilities, cylinder cabinets, process equipment, gas treatment systems, and the like. 6.2.4 Safe design depends on equipment designers’ and facilities designers’ understanding of silane family gas properties and hazards. Design methods for controlling these hazards require full integration of measures from all portions of the delivery and use systems. NOTE 3: Information on silane family gases’ hazards is available from various sources, including: regulations, MSDSs, Factory Mutual Loss Prevention Data Sheets, NFPA Standards, consensus Building Codes, and various research papers. 6.2.4.1 The supplier should complete, prior to use, a hazard identification and risk assessment [such as Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Hazard and Operability Analysis\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 6  General Principles (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 6  General Principles\n\nContent: (Haz-Op), Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)], for all silane family gas systems. 6.2.4.2 The results of the analysis should be reported using the SEMI S10 risk matrix. 6.2.5 Minimization of Quantity The quantity of any silane family gas online and in use should be limited to the smallest amount necessary for effective production.

Interrupted monitoring may not capture a pressure change that indicates ineffective purging. 14.4.2.1.1 The design of\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 14.4  Changing Sources (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 14.4  Changing Sources\n\nContent: automatic-sequence control systems for cylinder cabinets should incorporate the following features: a) Fault-tolerant design, b) The ability to perform a leak check of the container by measuring pressure rise in the system, with the container valve closed, under the condition that the container has been connected and the purge gas eliminated, c) Continuous pressure monitoring of the system during all purges and operating conditions, and d) Written procedures for safe source container replacement including verification requirements for the leak testing and verification of the sensing system function. NOTE 44: All tasks assessed as high risk (from the risk assessment) should minimize human interaction as much as possible.\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.1  General Considerations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.1  General Considerations\n\nContent: 15.1.1 To enable purging without venting into unsafe locations, a purge port should be installed at locations where sealed systems require purging. Purge ports should have a stop valve, if not connected to the purge gas, should be sealed with a cap or plug. 15.1.2 Dead leg sections (internal piping which can trap silane family gases) should be minimized to the smallest volume possible. 15.1.3 An excess flow control valve should be installed on every silane family gas piping system as close as practical to the source. The excess flow control valve should be sized to deliver only as much gas as necessary to the process requirements. NOTE 45: See Related Information 3 for an example. 15.1.3.1 Silane family gas delivery systems should be equipped with the following controls and safeguards: a) Excess flow protection, b) A manual shutdown valve at both the point of dispensing and in the distribution line near or in the equipment gas box, and c) Over-pressure monitors with pressure relief and\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.1  General Considerations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.1  General Considerations\n\nContent: automatic gas shutoff when pressure is detected above the designed limit.\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.2.1  Piping General\n\n15.2.1.1  Piping should be welded throughout or contained within an exhausted enclosure.  \nEXCEPTION: Non-welded piping, outdoors, may not require an enclosure.  \n15.2.1.2  Piping should be labeled with the gas name and flow direction.  \n15.2.1.3  If the piping diverges into two or more lines, each line should be provided with a shut off valve.  \nNOTE 46:  Some jurisdictions require both manual and automatic shut off valves.  \n15.2.1.3.1  These valves should enable cycle purging of each line.  \n15.2.1.3.2  These valves should be provided with an exhausted enclosure.  \n15.2.1.3.3  The enclosure should be monitored with detectors for the silane family gases present.  \n15.2.1.4  The ventilated enclosures should have exhaust monitoring per SEMI S2.  \n15.2.1.5  The piping of oxidizer gases should be isolated from the piping of silane family gases.  The isolation should also be applied to silane family gas purge lines.\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.2.2  Coaxial Piping (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.2.2  Coaxial Piping\n\nContent: NOTE 47: Some jurisdictions require building-runs of silane family gas piping to be of secondarily contained (coaxial) construction. Some believe there is little evidence that coaxial piping for these gases is appropriate, as long as nonwelded fittings are within secondary enclosures. Coaxial piping may add substantial costs and other hazards which should then be addressed. However, pressurized, monitored, and interlocked coax lines provide a local warning to persons who accidentally damage the jacket. The sound of the escaping inert gas used to pressurize the jacket alerts the worker. The interlock alerts the facility of the breach, and reduces the total amount of process gas lost if the inner line is damaged. 15.2.2.1 When coaxial piping is installed, the annular space should be pressurized with helium or other inert gas, purged, or maintained at a vacuum. 15.2.2.2 If a purge method is used, the purge gases from the coaxial piping should be monitored with detectors for the specific silane family\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.2.2  Coaxial Piping (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.2.2  Coaxial Piping\n\nContent: gas. 15.2.2.2.1 This detector should shut down the source when a leak is detected. 15.2.2.3 If a pressure or vacuum method is used, the pressure or vacuum in this annular space should be monitored and should alarm at a constantly attended location when a change occurs. 15.2.2.3.1 The alarm should also shut off the silane family gas at the nearest up-stream valve. 15.2.2.4 A procedure for responding to an annular space alarm, and determining the nature of the hazard condition, should be created.\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.3  Flow Components (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.3  Flow Components\n\nContent: 15.3.1 The state of a valve (open or closed) should be indicated through display or on the valve itself. The supplier should provide the user with reliability data for repeated operations, and the user should replace the valve within its expected lifetime. 15.4 Heaters and Heat Insulation Materials External heating of piping and regulators may be required in outside locations or long distance lines to prevent re-liquification. In such cases, the following should be considered: 15.4.1 If electrical resistance heating is used with insulation, the insulation should be visually inspected periodically for degradation or exposed wiring to avoid electrical arcing and damage to the piping. 15.4.1.1 Electrical resistance piping heating systems should not be placed in wet areas because of the increased possibility of damage from corrosion. 15.4.2 Electrical resistance piping heating systems should be monitored. Monitors should alarm in the event of over temperature, an open circuit or a short circuit and should\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.3  Flow Components (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING - # 15.3  Flow Components\n\nContent: shut off the power supply and gas supply. 15.4.2.1 Gas supply shutdown may be required by some jurisdictions.

Safe shutdown of the equipment itself or silane family gas sources may be appropriate. 16.1.2.1 Any silane process vacuum pump, when used, should be maintained and monitored for its ability to safely remove potentially hazardous silane family gases from equipment for maintenance and repair. NOTE 49: For fire detection, suppression, and alarm criteria see Section 9. 16.1.3 Fire detection system activation should shut off flammable and pyrophoric gases supplying the equipment being monitored, as this is the only safe method of extinguishing gas fires. 16.1.4 Equipment using silane family gases should be capable of performing a\n\nSEMI S18-1102 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY GUIDELINE FOR SILANE FAMILY GASES HANDLING -
