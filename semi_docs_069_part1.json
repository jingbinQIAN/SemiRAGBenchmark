Approval was by full letter ballot procedures with publication authorized by the NA Regional Standards Committee on October 21, 1999.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-1  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-1  Scope\n\nContent: A1-1.1 The increasing complexity of integrated circuits and the reduction in design rule dimensions place new demands on the characterization of wafer surface geometry. Various high resolution optical lithographic systems have very limited depth of field and use a variety of methods to hold the wafer, to establish the focal plane, and to position the wafer relative to the focal plane during exposure. These varying focusing and location methods differ enough to make a single, simple flatness criterion (such as global TIR) ineffective in predicting successful or unsuccessful lithography in all cases. A1-1.2 To clarify the requirements for wafer flatness characterization for the various classes of lithographic equipment, the decision tree depicted in Figure A1-1 has been developed. This tree gives an orderly procedure for selecting the various parameters that must be specified if wafer flatness is specified. A1-1.3 In this tree, it is assumed that the focal point is the site center for all parameters, except for SFQD, SFQR, SFSD, and\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-1  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-1  Scope\n\nContent: SFSR, where the focal plane is identical to the reference plane. Most flatness characterization systems employ this convention. However, a number of photolithographic aligners use slightly different conventions for determining the focal plane. Currently, the difference between the centerpoint and other focusing conventions has not been quantified, but it is presumed to be insignificant for material characterization purposes. A1-1.4 For sites to be included in the measurement, the site center must lie within the Flatness Quality Area (FQA). For subsites (se Figure A1-2) to be included in the measurement, the subsite center must lie within a site whose center is within the FQA and some of the subsite must lie within the FQA (see Figure A1-3).\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree\n\nContent: A1-2.1 In the decision tree, there are decision blocks, shown as diamonds, whose use requires some knowledge of the lithographic tool to be used. The rectangular blocks require information to be furnished; this information is dependent on the device layout and the manufacturing procedures to be employed (such as dedicated or mixed aligner use). A1-2.2 Step 1 — Select the Fixed Quality Area (FQA): Decide on and specify the nominal edge exclusion, $E E$ which defines the FQA. (See Figure 1.) A1-2.3 Step 2 — Choose the Measurement Method: Choose global flatness (G) if the lithographic tool uses a single, global exposure of the wafer, or choose site flatness (S) if the lithographic tool steps across the wafer, exposing only a portion of the wafer at a time. A1-2.3.1 If global flatness is chosen, proceed to Step 3. If site flatness is chosen, it is also necessary to specify site size (related to exposure area dimensions) and site array (including (a) number of sites, (b) location of sites relative to the\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree\n\nContent: center of the FQA and to each other, as in an offset or bricklaying pattern, and (c) whether or not partial sites are to be excluded). A1-2.4 Step 3 — Choose the Reference Surface: Choose front surface (F) or back surface (B), depending on whether the lithographic tool is referenced to the front or back surface. A1-2.5 Step 4 — Choose the Reference Plane and Area: A1-2.5.1 For global flatness measurements, a global reference plane is appropriate. If the lithographic tool is referenced to the back surface, an ideal plane (I) defined by the chuck which holds the wafer is appropriate. If the lithographic tool is referenced to the front surface, either a 3-point plane (3) defined by three points equally spaced about the edge of the front surface of the wafer or a plane defined by the least squares fit to the front surface (L) may be appropriate. The 3-point plane is appropriate if the lithographic tool holds the wafer in this fashion and does not allow interactive gimbaling of the wafer, while the least\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A1-2  Use of the Flatness Decision Tree\n\nContent: squares plane is appropriate if the lithographic tool allows interactive gimbaling of the wafer. Figure A1-1 Flatness Decision Tree A1-2.5.2 For site flatness measurements, any of the above three planes [(1), (3), or (L)] may be suitable or, if the wafer is regimballed once at each site, a site least squares reference plane (Q) may be appropriate or, if the wafer is regimballed more than once at each site, a subsite least squares reference plane (S) may be appropriate. A1-2.6 Step 5 — Choose the Measurement Parameter: Choose either TIR, also known as range (R), or FPD, also known as deviation (D). In the case of site measurements, it is possible to specify the maximum value of (R) or (D) or the percentage of the sites (or FQA) which have an (R) or (D) less than some specified value.

Larger wafer diameters and increasing complexity of processes and circuits have increased the need for accurate, standardized measurement of unclamped wafer geometry. The quantities that have historically been used, Bow and Back Surface Referenced Warp, may be inadequate to describe and quantify the geometries of interest in advanced processes. Additional surface geometry quantities, such as Sori and Median Surface Referenced Warp, have been introduced into standards. A2-1.2 In addition, there is considerable confusion as to the precise meaning of these quantities, even though they are defined in the applicable SEMI test methods. A2-1.3 The Shape Decision Tree was developed to provide an orderly method of identifying each of the variables involved in the quantities used to quantify unclamped wafer surface geometry. As such, the tree provides a concise and precise description of each shape\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A2-1  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A2-1  Scope\n\nContent: quantity. A branch of the tree consists of a selection of one of the choices for each variable. The variables and the choices for each are listed in Table A1-1. A2-1.4 Four branches of the tree, representing quantities for which measurement methods have been standardized by SEMI, are depicted in Figure A1-1. There are many other branches of the tree, not all of which may represent practical combinations of variables.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A2-2  Use of the Shape Decision Tree (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A2-2  Use of the Shape Decision Tree\n\nContent: A2-2.1 Step 1. Select the Fixed Quality Area (FQA): Decide on and specify the nominal edge exclusion, $E E$ , which defines the FQA. (See Figure 1.) A2-2.2 Step 2. Select the measurement method: global (over the entire fixed quality area) or local (over a site). NOTE 1: At present, all shape quantities in common use are global measurements. The significance and use of local shap quantities have yet to be defined. A2-2.3 Step 3. Select the reference surface: front, median, or back, to be used to establish the reference plane. A2-2.4 Step 4. Select the kind of reference plane: least-squares or 3-point. NOTE 2: A measurement made with a least-squares reference plane is less affected by small changes in wafer position within the measurement apparatus than is a measurement made with a 3-point reference plane.

A2-2.6 Step 6. Select the measurement surface: front, median, or back, for which the deviations are to be measured. A2-2.7 Step 7. Select the measurement pattern: full scan (a regular array of measurement points over the entire measurement area), partial scan (a specified pattern of measurement points covering only a portion of the measurement area), or centerpoint (measurement at the center of the wafer only). A2-2.8 Step 8. Select the parameter to be determined: range (TIR) or maximum RPD. A2-2.9 Step 9. Compare the branch thus obtained with the branches in Figure A2-1. If the branch obtained matches one of the branches illustrated in Figure A1-1, the resulting quantity is given by the code shown in the box at the bottom of the branch. Standard test methods have been adopted for measurement of each of these quantities. If the branch obtained does not match any of the branches illustrated\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A2-2  Use of the Shape Decision Tree (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # A2-2  Use of the Shape Decision Tree\n\nContent: in Figure A2-1, the quantity obtained has not been given a standardized term, nor has a standard test method been adopted for its measurement. A2-2.9.1 These codes, which uniquely describe the various branches, are formed from the codes in Table A2-1. Stating this code together with the numerical value for the FQA nominal edge exclusion provides enough information to describe the shape parameter and to establish numerical limits for it.

Under some circumstances these tests may be considered destructive, and an alternative means may be required. One nondestructive test is SEMI MF673, having a range from 0.0001 to $1 0 0 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ . Another nondestructive test is SEMI MF398, which is limited to carrier concentrations in the ranges from $1 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 8 }$ to $1 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 1 } ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ for $n$ -type silicon and from $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 8 }$ to $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ for $p$ -type silicon, and has only moderate inter-laboratory precision. Other older methods that require a bar-shaped test specimen include SEMI MF43 and DIN 50430; these methods are no longer in general use. It is also possible to establish the dopant density from room temperature measurements in silicon using SEMI MF723 (for boron, phosphorus, or arsenic doped silicon) or DIN 50444 (for\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-4  Electrical Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-4  Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: boron and phosphorus doped silicon only). SEMI MF1527 is a useful standard in describing ways of ensuring that resistivity measuring instruments are performing correctly. R2-4.2 Radial Resistivity Variation is generally determined by SEMI MF81 or DIN 50435. These test methods use several different measurement positions so the desired position must be specified. It is also possible to measure the resistivity in one of the circular patterns specified in SEMI MF1618 using SEMI MF1529 as the resistivity measurement method. R2-4.3 Resistivity Striations can generally be viewed visually using one of the techniques discussed in Section R2- 9. For an electrical measurement, spreading resistance (SEMI MF525) is generally employed but this is strictly an off-line measurement. R2-4.4 Minority Carrier Lifetime can be measured by a number of methods. The photoconductive decay methods (SEMI MF28, JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 0 4$ , and DIN 50440/1 all require the use of special test specimens; Microwave reflectivity\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-4  Electrical Characteristics (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-4  Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: measurements (SEMI MF1535 and JEITA EM-3502) are applicable to measurements on wafers, but special surface passivation procedures may be required to obtain meaningful results. Minority carrier lifetime may also be inferred from measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF1388, which yields generation lifetime if the measurements are made at room temperature and recombination lifetime if they are made at elevated temperature $5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $7 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The test specimens required for this test method can be made by procedures compatible with typical wafer processing.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-5  Chemical Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-5  Chemical Characteristics\n\nContent: R2-5.1 Oxygen Concentration in relatively high resistivity specimens $\\mathbf { \\hat { \\rho } } _ { \\mathcal { S } } ^ { } > 1$ to $3 \\Omega$ ·cm at room temperature) should be measured by infrared techniques. SEMI MF1188, JEITA EM-3504, and DIN 50438 all utilize approximately normal incidence illumination and the IOC-88 calibration factor to determine the interstitial oxygen content. See SEMI M44 for a discussion of other calibration factors and their relationship to IOC-88. SEMI MF1619 uses $p$ - polarized radiation, incident at the Brewster angle to reduce the multiple reflections from polished wafers. For more heavily doped wafers, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS, SEMI MF1366) and gas fusion analysis (GFA) can be used to determine total oxygen content. There is no standardized method for performing GFA, and the repeatability of this technique is generally poorer than SIMS. R2-5.2 Radial Oxygen Variation should be determined by measuring the oxygen content by one of the above methods at selected\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-5  Chemical Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-5  Chemical Characteristics\n\nContent: locations on the wafer defined in SEMI MF951. Usually measurements are made at the center and at a single point on the primary flat or notch bisector $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the edge of the wafer opposite the fiducial; this is known as test plan A-1. R2-5.3 Carbon Concentration should be measured by SEMI MF1391, JEITA 56, and DIN $5 0 4 3 8 / 2$ . The most modern calibration coefficients are used in SEMI MF1391 and JEITA 56. For these methods, the test specimen cannot be too heavily doped, and special thick test specimens may be necessary. R2-5.4 Boron Contamination in heavily doped $n$ -type silicon can be determined by SEMI MF1528.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-6  Structural Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-6  Structural Characteristics\n\nContent: R2-6.1 Dislocation Etch Pit Density, Slip, Lineage, Twins, and Swirl are usually displayed by etching and visual or microscopic observation. JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 0 9$ is a comprehensive test method for carrying out this procedure with the use of non-chromic etchants. SEMI MF1809 also recommends non-chromic etchants for this test. For the full procedure, SEMI MF1809 must be used with other standards including SEMI MF1726 and SEMI MF1810. DIN 50434 is an older, but comprehensive test procedure to observe these and other structural defects based on chrome-containing etchants. It is also possible to observe these defects by x-ray topography using DIN 50443/1. R2-6.2 Shallow Pits can be exposed by the relatively low temperature heating cycle and procedures in SEMI MF1049 if they are present in sufficient density, but testing for shallow pits in production environments is usually carried out using the temperature cycle in SEMI MF1727 followed by etching with etchants discussed in SEMI MF1809, examination by\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-6  Structural Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-6  Structural Characteristics\n\nContent: SEMI MF1726, and counting by SEMI MF1810. They can also be observed by using JIS ${ \\mathrm { ~ H ~ } } 0 6 0 9$ . R2-6.3 Oxidation Induced Stacking Faults (OISF) can be observed by using JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 0 9$ , or by using the temperature cycle in SEMI MF1727 followed by etching with etchants discussed in SEMI MF1809, examination by SEMI MF1726, and counting by SEMI MF1810. OISF can also be observed by x-ray topography using DIN 50443/1 following thermal treatment according to JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 0 9$ or SEMI MF1727. R2-6.4 Oxide Precipitates (Bulk Micro Defects, BMD) are generated with the use of a temperature cycle such as those in SEMI MF1239. The amount of precipitation can be measured by the oxygen reduction method of SEMI MF1239 or by direct observation by infrared that has not yet been standardized. R2-6.5 Bulk Defects can be detected by x-ray topography in accordance with DIN 50443/1.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics\n\nContent: R2-7.1 Diameter is presently very well controlled in silicon wafers that have been edge profiled with cam follower equipment. For three-point measurements at locations defined by SEMI MF2074 and, except for positions on 150 mm diameter, $n$ -type (100) wafers, by DIN 50441/4. The latter utilizes a measuring or projection microscope to make the diameter measurements, but the former allows a dial gauge or any other equally accurate method of dimensional measurement. R2-7.2 Flat Length should be determined by SEMI MF671. If flat diameter is specified instead of flat length, it can be determined by $\\ P 6 . 2 . 1$ of DIN 50441/4 or by a dial gauge method as agreed upon between the supplier and customer. Both SEMI MF671 and DIN 50441/4 take account of the possibility that the ends of the flat might be rounded. R2-7.3 Notch Dimensions should be determined by SEMI MF1152 (see Figure 5). R2-7.4 Flat Orientation can be confirmed by SEMI MF847.

R2-7.5 Edge Profile is usually determined by using one of the two templates (see Figure 6) with Method B of SEMI MF928 or Procedure 2 of DIN 50441/2, both of which are nondestructive. The other two procedures in these methods are destructive and not so widely used. R2-7.6 Thickness is usually determined at the center point of the wafer with the use of SEMI MF1530, an automated technique. Manual techniques originally used in the industry include SEMI MF533, JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 1 1$ , and DIN 50441/1. NOTE 2: Test methods SEMI MF1530 (for thickness, thickness variation, and flatness), SEMI MF1451 (for sori), and SEMI MF1390 (for warp) may not be suitable for use on large diameter wafers with polished back surfaces. New standardized test methods for measuring these parameters on such wafers are under development.

JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 1 1$ differs from SEMI MF533 and DIN 50441/1, in that the measurements in JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 1 1$ are taken at the center and at $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ from the edge on diameters parallel and perpendicular to the primary flat or notch bisector, while the measurements in SEMI MF533 and DIN 50441/1 are taken at the center and at $6 \\mathrm { m m }$ from the edge on diameters 30 degrees and 120 degrees counterclockwise from the bisector to the primary flat or notch (with the wafer facing front surface up). TTV can also be determined with the use of SEMI MF657, which involves a continuous scan pattern over a portion of the wafer surface. Currently, however, it is most frequently determined using SEMI MF1530, which involves an automated continuous scan pattern over the entire wafer surface. In this case, the quantity determined is equal to the global flatness GBIR (see Appendix 1 and Note 1, above). R2-7.8 Surface Orientation can be determined by\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics\n\nContent: the x-ray methods of SEMI MF26, JEITA EM-3501, or DIN $5 0 4 3 3 / 1$ , the optical method of SEMI MF26 or DIN $5 0 4 3 3 / 2$ , or the Laue method of DIN 50433/3. R2-7.9 For off-orientation {111} wafers, the orthogonal misorientation is specified for each of the wafer categories in Tables 4 through 9. There is no standardized measurement method for this property so it should be determined by a method agreed upon between supplier and customer. R2-7.10 Bow can be determined with the manual methods SEMI MF534 and JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 1 1$ . Currently, bow is not as widely used a parameter as warp. R2-7.11 Warp is currently most often measured with the use of SEMI MF1390, which is an automated method with full surface scan and correction for gravitational sag. It can also be measured with the use of the contactless manual method SEMI MF657, in which the prescribed scan pattern covers only a portion of the wafer surface in which there is no correction for gravitational sag.

Because SEMI MF657 employs a back surface reference plane, the measured warp may include contributions from thickness variation of the wafer. SEMI MF1390 employs a median surface reference plane and is not susceptible to interferences from thickness variations. In general, the latter is preferred, especially for wafers $1 5 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ in diameter and larger (see Note 1, above). R2-7.12 Sori , which is sometimes specified in lieu of bow or warp or both, can be determined by SEMI MF1451 (see Note 1, above). R2-7.13 Global Flatness can be determined by either capacitance measurements, as in SEMI MF1530, or by multiple beam interference, as in DIN 50441/3. Generally, the former is considered to be more reliable, especially as the need increases for measuring smaller flatness deviation (see Note 1, above). As noted in ¶R2-7.7, GBIR is the same as TTV; other global flatness parameters are discussed in Appendix 1. R2-7.14 Site Flatness is generally determined by\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2.7  Dimensional Characteristics\n\nContent: SEMI MF1530 (see Note 1, above). The most commonly used site flatness parameter is SFQR; other site flatness parameters are discussed in Appendix 1. Although it is not widely used, the scanning site flatness parameter SFSR was recently introduced. For this parameter, use a subsite width, Wss, equal to $8 \\mathrm { m m }$ and orient the wafer so the effective scan direction is along the wafer’s $y$ -axis as defined in SEMI M20. R2-7.14.1 SEMI M49 is a guide for specifying test equipment for use in determining thickness, shape, and flatness parameters on wafers intended to be used to fabricate advanced integrated circuits. R2-7.15 Nanotopography should be determined by SEMI M43. This guide gives a variety of options that can be used, so it is essential to specify the various conditions that are desired in any given case. The conditions chosen should be agreed upon between supplier and customer.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-8  Front Surface Chemistry (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-8  Front Surface Chemistry\n\nContent: R2-8.1 Surface Metal Contaminants R2-8.1.1 Sodium, aluminum, potassium, and iron can be measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS), or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). SIMS has been standardized as SEMI MF1617. The latter two methods are frequently combined with vapor phase decomposition (VPD), but they have not yet been standardized. R2-8.1.2 Potassium, chromium, iron, nickel, copper, and zinc can be measured by Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TXRF), ICP/MS, and AAS. TXRF has been standardized both with (SEMI M33 and ISO 17706) and without (ISO 14706) use of VPD to preconcentrate the surface metal contaminants. R2-8.1.2.1 VPD is chemical preconcentration of the surface metals using vapor phase HF to decompose the surface native oxide and a water (or acid-spiked water) droplet to scan across the wafer dissolving the surface metals. The recovery rate of this preconcentration method is dependent upon the chemistry of the surface\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-8  Front Surface Chemistry (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-8  Front Surface Chemistry\n\nContent: metals and upon the chemistry used for the preconcentration. An alternative preconcentration method to VPD is to scan an acid droplet across the wafer surface. R2-8.1.2.2 VPD/AAS is a single-element technique which is widely used in Japan. It is element-specific and very sensitive. VPD/ICP-MS is a rapid multi-element technique which is a more recent development. It is also very sensitive, but its reproducibility is dependent upon the injection process into the ICP-MS. VPD/TXRF is an even more recently developed multi-element technique. It is also very sensitive, but its reproducibility is dependent on the residue-drying process. R2-8.2 Surface Organics can be measured by SEMI MF1982. This standard describes two methods; the method to be utilized should be agreed upon between supplier and customer.\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics\n\nContent: R2-9.1 Visual Inspection of either the front or back surface of wafers can be carried out in accordance with SEMI MF523 or JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 1 4$ . The following conditions should be used for examination under high intensity illumination: Background light intensity: $8 \\pm 2$ fc $( 8 6 \\pm 2 2 \\mathrm { l u x } )$ ), Angle (alpha): $4 5 ^ { \\circ } \\pm 1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , and Angle (beta): $9 0 ^ { \\circ } \\pm 1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . See $\\yen 6$ for a discussion of which artifacts on the surface should be considered as defects. SEMI MF154 is a useful guide for identifying structures and contaminants seen on silicon surfaces. R2-9.1.1 Scratches—In inspecting for scratches, it is important to note that while macro-scratches can be seen under both high intensity and diffuse illumination, micro-scratches can be seen only under high intensity illumination. Therefore, to separate the two kinds of scratches, it is necessary to count the scratches observed under both kinds of illumination. The count of\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics\n\nContent: scratches seen under diffuse illumination is the number of macro-scratches while the difference of the counts seen under high intensity illumination and diffuse illumination is the number of microscratches. Of course, if the total requirement is for no scratches of either kind, then examination under high intensity illumination only is adequate. R2-9.2 X-ray Topography (DIN 50443/1) can also be used to test for defects in silicon wafers. This method may see defects that do not intersect the surface, and can also be used to examine for bulk defects in the wafer (see Section 2.4.10 of Table 1). R2-9.3 Automated Surface Inspection by Light Scattering can also be used to detect many surface defects, especially on polished surfaces. These techniques have not been fully standardized but there is a group of standards that assist in making certain that the instruments are performing correctly. These include SEMI M52 for determining if surface scanning inspection systems (SSIS) have suitable characteristics for\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics\n\nContent: the desired use, SEMI M53 for calibrating SSISs, SEMI M58 for assuring that the calibration artifacts meet the desired requirements, SEMI M50 for determining capture rate characteristics of SSISs and SEMI M35 for discriminating among various surface features with an SSIS. Because of the lack of complete standardization, the testing conditions for use of SSISs should be agreed upon between supplier and customer. R2-9.3.1 Localized Light Scatterers — SSISs are particularly appropriate for inspecting polished surfaces for the presence of particles and other localized light scatterers (LLS). In this case, it is essential to define the size ranges (in units of latex sphere equivalents, LSE) as well as the maximum permissible counts, usually in terms of counts per wafer, but occasionally in terms of counts per unit area. R2-9.4 Surface Roughness affects the size of particle or other LLS that can be detected on a surface. SEMI M40 provides guidance on how to measure and report surface roughness on planar\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics\n\nContent: surfaces. Surface microroughness can be determined with SSISs, through the use of the power spectral density as described in SEMI MF1811, or with an atomic force microscope, which can be calibrated with the use of JEITA EM-3505. Other documents useful in connection with surface microroughness measurements include ISO 4287/1 and ANSI/ASME B46.1. Because of the lack of standardization, the testing conditions for surface microroughness measurements should be agreed upon between supplier and customer. R2-9.5 Back Surface Finish of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ diameter wafers is specified as “polished.” The standard quantitative test for the polish finish, which is not a smooth as the mirror polished front surface, is gloss. The general techniques for determining gloss are given in ASTM Test Method D 523 and JIS Z 8741. However, for measuring gloss of silicon surfaces, visible illumination at a $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ angle of incidence is referenced to a mirror polished silicon front surface. Surface\n\nSEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI M1-0305SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICONWAFERS - # R2-9  Surface Inspection Characteristics\n\nContent: microroughness measurements (see ¶R2-9.4) can also be used as a quantitative test for back surface finish, especially when it is necessary to observe particles or other LLSs smaller than $0 . 2 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ LSE on the surface.

Also called self-doping. NOTE 1: Sources of autodoping can be the back and front surfaces and edges of the substrate, other substrates in the reactor, the susceptor, or other parts of the deposition assembly. 4.3.2 chemical vapor deposition, in semiconductor technology — a process in which a controlled chemical reaction produces a thin surface film. NOTE 2: Epitaxial growth is an example of a special case of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 4.3.3 edge crown — the difference between the surface elevation 1/8 inch $( 3 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ from the edge of the wafer and the elevation at the wafer edge. 4.3.4 effective layer thickness, of an epitaxial layer — the depth from the front\n\nSEMI M2-1103 SPECIFICATlON FOR SILICON EPITAXIAL WAFERS FOR DISCRETE DEVICE APPLICATIONS - # 4  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M2-1103 SPECIFICATlON FOR SILICON EPITAXIAL WAFERS FOR DISCRETE DEVICE APPLICATIONS - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: surface in which the net carrier density is within the specified limits. 4.3.5 epi profile slope, of an epitaxial layer — the difference between the net carrier density at 0.75 of the layer thickness and the net carrier density at 0.25 of the layer thickness divided by one-half the layer thickness: $$ \\mathrm { e p i } \\mathrm { p r o f i l e s l o p e } = \\frac { N _ { 0 . 7 5 t } - N _ { 0 . 2 5 t } } { 0 . 5 t } $$ where: $N =$ net carrier density, $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ , and $t \\ =$ layer thickness, $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . 4.3.6 epitaxial layer — a layer of single crystal semiconductor material grown on a host substrate that determines its orientation. 4.3.7 epitaxy — The growth of a single crystal layer on a substrate of the same material, homoepitaxy; or on a substrate of different material with a compatible crystal structure, heteroepitaxy. 4.3.8 flat zone, of an epitaxial layer — The depth from the front surface to the point where the net carrier density is $20 \\%$ greater than or less than the\n\nSEMI M2-1103 SPECIFICATlON FOR SILICON EPITAXIAL WAFERS FOR DISCRETE DEVICE APPLICATIONS - # 4  Terminology (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M2-1103 SPECIFICATlON FOR SILICON EPITAXIAL WAFERS FOR DISCRETE DEVICE APPLICATIONS - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: average net carrier density (see Section 8.3.2) of the region between 0.25 and 0.75 of the layer thickness. 4.3.9 thickness, of an epitaxial layer — The distance from the surface of the wafer to the layer-substrate interface. 4.3.10 transition width, of an epitaxial layer deposited on a more heavily doped substrate of the same conductivity type — The difference between the layer thickness as determined by infrared reflectance (see Section 8.3.1) and the flat zone based on the same thickness measurement.",
