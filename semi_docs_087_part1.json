Overall accuracy with this method is $\\pm ~ 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\Omega$ .  This accuracy estimate includes basic instrumentation error, probe placement repeatability, and typical package construction (printed pattern accuracy).\n\nSEMI G23-0996 TEST METHOD FOR INDUCTANCE OF INTERNAL TRACES OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Application Note (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G23-0996 TEST METHOD FOR INDUCTANCE OF INTERNAL TRACES OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 4  Application Note\n\nContent: Readings below $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m } } \\Omega$ can be made with acceptable reeatability if considerable care in pleacement is taken. For example, in measuring a conductor made of tungsten $0 . 0 1 0 \"$ wide, a $0 . 0 1 0 \"$ variation in the distance between the two sets of probes will result in a $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\Omega$ change in the measured reading. The same variation in a gold conductor would result in a $3 { - } 5 \\mathrm { m } \\Omega$ error. NOTICE: These standards do not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with their use.

A filtered aliquot of sample is injected into an Ion chromatograph. The sample is pumped by the eluent stream through two (2) different ion exchange columns: a guard column, which serves to protect the separator column from residual particulate matter and retain certain organics, and the separator column, the primary function of which is to separate analyzed ions based on their affinity for the exchange sites of the resin. Both guard column and the separator column are packed with identical low capacity anion exchanger (anion analysis) or cation exchange (cation analysis). The separated ionic species then pass to a detector module consisting of a chemical suppressor device and a conductivity cell. The suppressor device is used to reduce background conductivity of the eluent to a low, or\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 6.4.4  Calculation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 6.4.4  Calculation\n\nContent: negligible level, and convert analyte anions into their acid form or analyte cations into their hydroxide form. Thus, separated and modified ionic species are detected using an electrical conductivity cell. Anions are identified based on their retention time compared to the known standards. Quantitation is accomplished by measuring the peak height or area, and comparing it to a calibration curve generated from known standards. NOTE 5: For recommended practice for ion chromatography analyses, see instrument manufacturer’s literature and ASTM D 4327.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 6.5.2  Interferences\n\n6.5.2.1  High levels of organic acids may be present in molding compound extracts.

Because the plasma ionizes most atomic species, background interferences are vastly reduced and linear response over several orders of magnitude can be observed for most elements. The sample extract is aspirated into the plasma by means of a high purity argon carrier gas. The resulting emissions are directed into the spectrometer and signal strengths are read by photomultiplier tubes placed at emission points in a focal curve. A computer is used to scan each elemental channel many times a second, and this output is sent to a printer in numerical form. The cycle or time of analysis is usually about seven (7) seconds. With this instrument, very little of the extracted sample is consumed.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 6.6.2  Instrument Conditions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 6.6.2  Instrument Conditions\n\nContent: Typical operating conditions are: 6.6.3 Measurement of Sodium, Potassium, and Antimony — A standard solution of ten (10) ppm of sodium, potassium, and antimony should be prepared and cycled through the ICP instrument. The blank extract sample and the unknown molding compound extracts are then run through the ICP. The values obtained for sample are corrected by subtracting values obtained for the blank. With the ICP, sodium, potassium, and antimony can be analyzed with sensitivities to the ten (10) PPB levels. Any additional elements present may be obtained on the same cycle with no additional preparation.

This test method deals only with junction-to-case or mounting surface measurements of thermal resistance and limits itself to heat sink and fluid bath testing environments. Following the guidelines outlined in this test method, junction-to-case thermal resistance measurements of ceramic packages using the heat sink and fluid bath methods should give the same results only under certain limited conditions (i.e., under conditions that approximate unidirectional heat flow through the chip and substrate to the preferred heat removal surface). If discrepancies occur, the heat sink mounting technique shall be considered as the referee test method. The heat sink mounting method for measuring junction-to-case thermal resistance will be a conservative measure of the package’s ability to transfer heat to the ambient environment because heat sinking is provided only on one side of the package, whereas the fluid bath mounting method has\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: the potential for equally cooling both sides of the package. 1.1 Definitions — The following d efinitions and symbols shall apply for the purpose of this test: a. case temperature, ${ \\mathrm { T } } _ { \\mathrm { C } } ,$ in degrees Celsius. The case temperature is the temperature at a specified accessible reference point on the package in which the microelectronic chip is mounted. b. mounting surface temperature, $\\mathrm { { T _ { M } } . }$ , in degrees Celsius. The mounting surface temperature is the temperature of a specified point at the device-heat sink mounting interface (or primary heat removal surface). c. junction temperature, ${ \\mathrm { T } } _ { \\mathrm { J } } ,$ , in degrees Celsius. The term is used to denote the temperature of the semiconductor junction in the microcircuit in which the major part of the heat is generated. For purposes of this test, the measured junction temperature is only indicative of the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the element used to sense the temperature. d. power dissipation,\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 1  Purpose (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: $\\mathrm { \\bf P _ { H } } ,$ in watts, is the heating power applied to the device causing a junction-to-reference point temperature difference. e. thermal resistance, junction-to-specified reference point, RΘJR, in degrees Celsius/watt. The thermal resistance of the microcircuit is the temperature difference from the junction to some reference point on the package divided by the power dissipation $\\mathrm { \\bf P _ { H } }$ . f. temperature-sensitive parameter, TSP, is the temperature-dependent electrical characteristic of the junction under test which can be calibrated with respect to temperature and subsequently used to detect the junction temperature of interest.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus\n\nContent: 2.1 The apparatus required for the se tests shall include the following as applicable to the specified test procedures. a. Thermocouple material shall be copper-constantan (type T) or equivalent, for the temperature range -100 to $+ 3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The wire size shall be no larger than AWG size 30. The junction of the thermocouple shall be welded to form a bead rather than soldered or twisted. The accuracy of the thermocouple and associated measuring system shall be $\\pm 0 . 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . b. Suitable electrical equipment as required to provide controlled levels of conditioning power and to make the specified measurements. The instrument used to electrically measure the temperature-sensitive parameter shall be capable of resolving a voltage change of $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m V }$ . c. Controlled temperature chamber, fluid bath, or heat sink capable of maintaining the specified reference point temperature to within $\\pm \\ : 0 . 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ of the preset (measured) value. Typical\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus\n\nContent: temperature-controlled heat sink and fluid bath assemblies are presented for illustrative purposes only. 2.2 Heat Sink Assembly — A typic al heat sink assembly for mounting the microelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 1. The primary heat sink is water cooled using a temperature-controlled fluid circulator bath. An adapter socket/heat sink is fastened to the heat removal surface of the primary heat sink, and has a special geometry to handle specific size packages (e.g., flat packs, dual-in-line packages, chip carriers). This adapter provides a repeatable and efficient interface between the package and the primary heat sink. The mounting surface temperature is determined with a thermocouple attached from the side or bottom of the adapter with a thermal conducting adhesive or grease at or near the interface between the adapter and the package. It is at this point that the device-under-test temperature is specified and controlled. The adapter also contains the socket or other electrical interconnection scheme. A thin\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus\n\nContent: coating (about $2 5 - 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ thick) of a thermal heat-sinking compound, such as zinc-oxide-loaded silicone thermal grease, is used at the interface to provide a reliable thermal contact. 2.3 Fluid Bath Assembly — A typ ical temperaturecontrolled fluid bath for thermally characterizing the microelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 2. In this figure, the package is mounted in a fluid bath separate from the fluid circulator, although it can be immersed directly in an integrated fluid circulator/bath unit. The fluid in the bath should be continuously stirred or agitated to ensure the required temperature stability. Since this working fluid is being used as an infinite heat sink, the case-to-fluid (ambient) temperature difference at the case temperature reference point of interest should be minimized, i.e., less than or equal to $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } .$ . For case-to-fluid temperature differences greater than $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , accuracy and repeatability difficulties may occur due to\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus\n\nContent: a large variable temperature gradient in the fluid film boundary layer at the package-fluid interface. The case-to-fluid temperature difference can be minimized by increasing the fluid velocity and by decreasing the power density seen by the fluid. The device under test should be mounted such that heat transfer to the fluid is not impeded. For leaded devices, the leads should be oriented in such a manner so as not to interfere with the heat transfer to the fluid and provide freedom to any thermal currents caused by the power dissipation within the package. The case temperature of the device under test should be measured with a thermocouple that is attached to the package and should not be assumed to be at the fluid temperature. Care should be taken to minimize exposure of the thermocouple bead to the high temperature gradient in the fluid film boundary layer at the package-fluid interface. The working fluid should have a thermal conductivity at $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ of at least 0.0006 $\\mathrm { W / c m ^ { \\circ } C }$\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  Apparatus\n\nContent: . Working fluids such as inert fluorocarbon liquids and silicone oils are suitable as a cooling media.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure\n\nContent: 3.1 Direct Measurement of Refere nce Point Temperature — $\\mathrm { T _ { C } }$ . For the purpose of measuring a microelectronic device thermal resistance, the reference point temperature shall be measured at the package location of highest temperature which is accessible outside the package. This reference point location is determined with the device operating in free air and with no external heat-sinking. In general, this reference point is found to be on the outside surface of the package substrate directly underneath the chip in the major path of heat flow from the chip to the heat sink or ambient. Examples of the reference point location for both cavity-up and cavity-down ceramic packages are depicted in Figure 3. The package surface may be altered to facilitate this measurement, provided that such alteration does not affect the original heat transfer paths and, hence, the thermal resistance, within the package by more than a few percent. For packages with an integral heat dissipater attached to the outside surface of the\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure\n\nContent: package substrate, the case temperature reference point shall be on the surface of the heat dissipater at a point opposite the backside of the chip as indicated in Figure 4. 3.1.1 Case temperature, $\\mathrm { T _ { C } }$ . The mic roelectronic device under test shall be mounted under specified conditions so that the case temperature can be held at the specified value. A thermocouple shall be attached on the surface of the device package directly under the chip. A conducting epoxy may be used for this purpose. The thermocouple bead should be in direct mechanical contact with the case of the microelectronic device under test. For devices which, in their normal application, are intimately connected (by pressure contact, adhesive, soldering, or other means) to an external heat sink, the mounting surface temperature, as measured directly below the primary heat removal surface of the case, may be used as the equivalent case temperature. If it is found that attaching the thermocouple directly to the case is impractical, an alternate\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure\n\nContent: approach utilizing a thermocouple welded to one side of a thin metal disk should be used. This can be accomplished by parallel gap welding the crossed thermocouple wires to one side of a $0 . 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ (0.094 in) diameter, $0 . 0 2 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ (0.008 in) thick beryllium-copper disk and then, with a thin layer of adhesive, bonding the other side of the disk to the case at the point of interest. 3.1.1.1 Mounting surface temperature , $\\mathrm { \\Delta T _ { M } }$ . The mounting surface temperature is measured directly below the primary heat removal surface of the case. It is measured with a thermocouple at or near the mounting surface of the heat sink. A typical mounting arrangement is shown in Figure 5. The surface of the copper mounting base shall be nickel plated and free of oxides. The thermocouple hole shall be drilled into the mounting base such that the thermocouple lead is directly below the area on the case of interest. It is recommended that the thermocouple be secured into the mounting base with a\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  Procedure\n\nContent: thermal conducting adhesive (or solder) and that particular attention be paid to minimizing air voids around the ball or the thermocouple. A thermal conducting compound (or adhesive) should be used at the interfaces of the mounting base and the device under test. The mounting surface technique is application oriented in that it takes into account the mounting surface interface.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR\n\nContent: 3.2.1 General Considerations The thermal resistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of the ability of its carrier or package and mounting technique to provide for heat removal from the semiconductor junction. The thermal resistance of a microelectronic device can be calculated when the case/mounting surface temperature and power dissipation in the device and a measurement of the junction temperature are known. When making the indicated measurements, the package shall be considered to have achieved thermal equilibrium when halving the time between the application of power and the taking of the reading causes no error in the indicated results within the required accuracy of measurement. 3.2.2 Indirect Measurement of Junction Temperature for the Determination of $\\cdot R _ { \\Theta J R }$ — The purpose of the test is to measure the thermal resistance of integrated circuits by using particular semiconductor elements on the chip to indicate the device junction temperature.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR\n\nContent: In order to obtain a realistic estimate of the operating junction temperature, the whole chip in the package should be powered in order to provide the proper internal temperature distribution. During measurement of the junction temperature the chip heating power (constant voltage source) shall remain constant while the junction calibration current remains stable. It is assumed that the calibration current will not be affected by the circuit operation during the application of heating power. The temperature-sensitive device parameter is used as an indicator of an average (weighted) junction temperature of the semiconductor element for calculations of thermal resistance. The measured junction temperature is indicative of the temperature only in the immediate vicinity of the element used to sense the temperature. The temperature-sensitive electrical parameters generally used to indirectly measure the junction temperature are the forward voltage of diodes and the emitter-base\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR\n\nContent: voltage of bipolar transistors. Other appropriate temperature-sensitive parameters may be used for indirectly measuring junction temperature for fabrication technologies that do not lend themselves to sensing the active junction voltages. 3.2.2.1 Steady-state technique for mea suring $\\mathrm { T _ { J } }$ . The following symbols shall apply for the purpose of these measurements: The measurement of $\\mathrm { T _ { J } }$ using junction forward voltage as the TSP is made in the following manner: Step 1 — Measurement of the temperature coefficient of the TSP (calibration). The coefficient of the temperature-sensitive parameter is generated by measuring the TSP as a function of the reference point temperature, for a specified constant measuring current, IM, by externally heating the device under test in an oven or in a fluid bath. The referencepoint temperature range used during calibration shall encompass the temperature range encountered in the power application test (see\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR\n\nContent: Step 2). The measuring current is generally chosen such that the TSP decreases linearly with increasing temperature over the range of interest, and that negligible internal heating occurs in the silicon and metal traces. For determining the optimum TSP calibration or measuring current, $\\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M C } }$ vs. $\\mathrm { l o g } \\mathrm { I _ { M } }$ curves for two temperature levels that encompass the calibration temperature range of interest should be plotted. The optimum measuring current, $\\mathrm { { I _ { M } } , }$ is then selected such that it resides on the linear portion of the two $\\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M C } }$ vs. log $\\mathrm { \\Delta I _ { M } }$ curves that were generated. A measuring current ranging from 0.05 to $5 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m A }$ is generally used, depending on the specifications and operating conditions of the device under test, for measuring the TSP. The value of the TSP temperature coefficient, V $\\mathrm { { _ { M C } / T _ { M C } }\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3.2 Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference point, RΘJR\n\nContent: }$ , for the particular measuring current used in the test, is calculated from the calibration curve, $\\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M C } }$ vs. $\\mathrm { T _ { M C } }$ . At least three points should be used to generate the voltage vs. temperature curve for the determination of the TSP temperature coefficient.\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # Step 2 — Power application test. (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # Step 2 — Power application test.\n\nContent: The power application test is performed in two parts. For both portions of the test, the reference point temperature is held constant at a preset value. The first measurement to be made is that of the temperaturesensitive parameter, i.e., $\\mathrm { V _ { M C } }$ , under operating conditions with the measuring current, $\\mathrm { { I } _ { M } } .$ , used during the calibration procedure. The microelectronic device under test shall then be operated with heating power $( \\mathrm { P _ { H } } )$ applied. The temperature-sensitive parameter, $\\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M H } , }$ shall be measured with constant measuring current, $\\mathrm { { I _ { M } } , }$ , that was applied during the calibration procedure (See Step 1). The heating power, $\\mathrm { \\bf P _ { H } }$ , shall be chosen such that the calculated junction-to-reference point temperature difference as measured at $ { \\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M H } } }$ is greater than or equal to $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . In accomplishing this, the device under\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # Step 2 — Power application test.

Care should also be taken not to exceed the design ratings of the package-interconnect system, as this may lead to an overestimation of the power being dissipated in the active area of the chip due to excessive power losses in the package leads and wire bonds. The values of $\\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M H } }$ , $\\mathrm { \\Delta V _ { M C } } ,$ , and $\\mathrm { \\bf P _ { H } }$ are recorded during the power application test. The following data shall be recorded for these test conditions: a. Temperature-sensitive electrical parameters $( \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { F } } ,$ , $\\mathrm { v _ { E B } }$ , or other appropriate TSP). b. Junction temperature, $\\Gamma _ { \\mathrm { J } } ,$ is calculated from the equation: $\\mathrm { T _ { J } = T _ { R } + \\left( V _ { M H } - V _ { M C } \\right) \\frac { \\Delta V _ { M C } } { \\Delta T _ { M C } } } \\Bigg | ^ { -\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # Step 2 — Power application test.

A sample data format for the test chip can be found in Appendix A. Based on the results of computer simulations of various chip-substrate configurations (Section 3.1), the following recommendations are made for the design of thermal test chips for VLSI package characterization (Section 3.2).\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline\n\nContent: 2.1 Heat Sources — The heat sour ces (i.e., transistors or resistor stripes), should use as much of the active chip area as possible so that the measured package thermal resistance is indicative of the chip size being used. A $\\mathrm { 1 0 ~ m i l }$ $\\mathrm { ( 0 . 2 5 ~ m m ) }$ parameter stripe (inactive area) should be sufficient for bonding pads and scribe lanes. It is desirable to use a range of test chip sizes so that the package thermal resistance can be determined as a function of chip size. A basic cell size of $7 5 \\ \\mathrm { m i l }$ $( 1 . 9 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ square with a power dissipation capability of 7.5 to $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ is recommended. The heat source area should exceed $8 5 \\%$ of this basic cell active chip area. This basic cell could be arrayed or scaled up to a 450 mil $1 1 . 4 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m } )$ square chip in increments of $7 5 \\mathrm { \\ m i l }$ $( 1 . 9 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ on a side. For larger chip sizes, the basic cell size should be chosen so arrays can match the\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline\n\nContent: chip sizes in actual use. Since the larger chips can be $1 5 { - } 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ per side, the basic cell may need to be $5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ per side, so a $3 \\times 3$ array can be $1 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ square minimum. 2.2 Spacing between Heat Sources — The spacing between heat sources, which is needed to accommodate the temperature-sensing elements (i.e., p-n junctions), should be minimized. The spacing should be less than or equal to $2 \\ \\mathrm { m i l }$ $( 0 . 0 5 1 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m } )$ . The sensing element should be located at the center of the chip surface. For chips that are built up from an array of standard cells, sensing elements are also needed near a corner and between two adjacent corners (i.e., near or in the inactive regions), of the basic cell. Additional sensing elements for such purposes as die attachment evaluation and non-uniform power dissipation studies may be included as appropriate. All sensing elements and associated metallization runs must be electrically isolated from the heat\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline\n\nContent: sources. 2.3 Thermal Test Chip Thickness — The thermal test chip thickness should be between $1 8 ~ \\mathrm { m i l }$ $\\left( 0 . 4 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m } \\right)$ and $2 2 \\mathrm { \\ m i l }$ $\\mathrm { 0 . 5 6 ~ m m } )$ ). For thin packages, the test chip thickness should be reduced to the normal die thickness for that package. 2.4 Thermal Test Chip — The ther mal test chip should be designed such that its power dissipation limitations are consistent with the range of package thermal resistance encountered. This includes properly designed metallization runs such that for arrayed test chips, heating current for inner chips is routed so that wire runs from the package to inner chips are minimized. The ability to cause a chip surface-to-case temperature difference of at least $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ is desirable. To accomplish this for silicon chips mounted on a variety of substrates (ranging from alumina to beryllia), the basic cell structure (i.e., $7 5 \\mathrm { \\ m i l }$ $( 1 . 9 1 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m } )$ on a\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline\n\nContent: side) should dissipate a minimum of $7 . 5 \\mathrm { W }$ . 2.5 Bond Pads — Band pads (clear opening) should be equal to or greater than $4 \\mathrm { \\ m i l }$ $( 0 . 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } )$ on a side. Sensing and heating elements should not be connected to common bonding pads. Bonding pad location and size can or should be configured such that for arrayed test chips, chip-to-chip bonding is facilitated (i.e., bonding wire runs from the package to inner chips are minimized), but this is not mandatory for acceptable functional operation. 2.6 Temperature-Sensing Diode/Diode Bridge Elements The temperature-sensing diode/diode bridge elements should be usable over the complete operating power and temperature range of the thermal test chip. The thermal test chip should function at junction temperature of $1 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ minimum. 2.7 Arrayed and Scaled Up Therm al Test Chips — Pictorial representation of arrayed and scaled up thermal test chips are depicted in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Heating elements\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 2  General Guideline\n\nContent: (shaded areas) are transistors or resistor stripes connected in a variety of series-parallel combinations on as well as off the chip. The heating elements should fill as much of the shaded area as practical (consistent with the integrated circuit layout design rules).\n\nSEMI G29-1296E TEST METHOD FOR TRACE CONTAMINANTS IN MOLDING COMPOUNDS - # 3  References\n\n3.1 Albers, J., “Semiconductor Me asurement Technology: TXYZ: A Program for Semiconductor IC Thermal Analysis,” NIST Spec.
