Type 2 — Equipment is energized. Energized circuits are covered or insulated. NOTE 38: Type 2 work includes tasks where the energized circuits are or can be measured by placing probes through suitable openings in the covers or insulators. Type 3 — Equipment is energized. Energized circuits are exposed and inadvertent contact with uninsulated energized parts is possible. Potential exposures are no greater than 30 volts rms, 42.4 volts peak, 60 volts dc or 240 volt-amps in dry locations. Type 4 — Equipment is energized. Energized circuits are exposed and inadvertent contact with uninsulated energized parts is possible. Potential exposures are greater than 30 volts rms, 42.4 volts peak, 60 volts dc, or 240 volt-amps in dry locations. Potential exposures to"

The supplier should move as many tasks as practical from category Type 4 to Types 1, 2, or 3. Routine Type 4 tasks, excluding troubleshooting, should have specific written instructions in the maintenance manuals. General safety procedures (e.g., wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment and establishing barriers) for troubleshooting, including Type 4 work, should be provided. 13.4 Electrical Design — Equipment should conform to the appropriate international, regional, national or industry product safety requirements. 13.4.1 Nonconductive or grounded conductive physical barriers should be provided: Where it is"
