Measure the initial leakage current at 500 volts maximum. NOTE 3: The leakage current shall be measured after 5 minutes voltage application. 5.3 Repeat the measurement for al l the lead pairs, $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ with ${ \\bf A } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathbf { B } _ { 1 }$ with $\\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ , and $\\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ with ${ \\bf B } _ { 3 }$ . 5.4 Place the samples in the HAST chamber and run the test. 5.5 After the tester has been autom atically cooled to room temperature, remove the samples. 5.6 Measure the leakage current b etween the same lead pairs mentioned in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. 5.7 Repeat the HAST exposure an d measure the cur-rent leakage. 5.8 Calculation 5.8.1 Maximum and minimum leaka ge current shall represent the test results. 5.8.2 Calculate the average result fo r all of the test points at each test stage. 5.8.3"
