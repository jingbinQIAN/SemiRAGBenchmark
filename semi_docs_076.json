This test method describes standard procedures for Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) fabrication, electrical measurement, analysis, and reporting. 2.2 Thermally grown gate oxide films with gate oxide thicknesses ranging from $2 0 { - } 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { ~ n m }$ and polysilicon electrodes are used as MOS capacitors. Discussion of the gate oxide thickness is given in a later section. 2.3 Time Zero Dielectric Breakdown (TZDB) is used as the electrical characterization method of MOS capacitors. 2.4 It is well known that oxygen precipitates are also a source of gate oxide defects.1 However, this is beyond the scope of this standard because the as-received wafers contain only a small amount of oxygen precipitate.

NOTE 2: The TZDB method measures oxide breakdown electric fields using MOS capacitors. The density of COPs can be estimated from a histogram of the breakdown electric field. NOTE 3: For a detailed discussion of sample structures for this test method, the reader is referred to EIA/JEDEC Standard 35-1. In general, the three most likely sample structures are simple planar MOS capacitors, MOS capacitors with various isolation structures (for example, local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS), shallow trench isolation (STI)), and field effect transistors (FET). For the purpose of silicon wafer characterization, the simple planar MOS capacitor structure is preferable. This is because with the various isolation structures and FET, silicon wafers sometimes receive thermal treatments during the complicated sample fabrication process. Therefore, it is questionable to look upon a measurement of one of the latter two wafers as the starting silicon wafer characterization. NOTE 4: This standard is based on round robin"

The defect is estimated from the Bmode failure fraction. This test is for characterizing silicon wafers and is very useful in evaluating the crystal defects (mainly COPs) of mirror-polished CZ silicon wafers. 5.2 MOS Capacitor Fabrication Process — Many MOS capacitors are formed on the test wafer. The MOS capacitor fabrication process consists of wafer cleaning, thermal oxidation, polysilicon deposition, phosphorous doping, activation heat treatment, photolithography and polysilicon etching. 5.2.1 Fabrication Environment — It is necessary to fabricate MOS capacitors in a clean room environment of 1000 class or better in total quality.

The spatial distribution of scattered light from COPs and particles is different, and therefore these two classes of defects may be distinguished by an appropriately equipped SSIS. COPs were first detected by SSIS and believed to be small particles. It was also noticed that after repeated cleaning (etching) the number of the COPs increased as the etching process enlarged the pits and changed their scattering characteristics. Later these defects were identified as voids caused by the coalescence of vacancies during the cooling of the silicon crystal from its growth temperature. The term crystal originated particle had already become accepted, and even today many people still refer to COPs by their original,"

However, the measured amplitude of the light scatter signal depends on both the characteristics of the SSIS and the characteristics of the scatter source. The use of a deposition of polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres (see Section 5.3.4) as a known source of scatter signal allows meaningful comparisons to be made between scatter signals from PSL spheres as measured by dark field detection systems of different designs. On the other hand, calibration with PSL spheres alone does not guarantee meaningful performance comparisons to be made between dark field detection SSISs of the same or different designs when detecting either real particles of materials different from PSL spheres or other surface defects. 1.2 This practice"

The data set is usually partitioned into bins of equal size on either a linear or logarithmic scale, as appropriate.

Automated inspection techniques are quantitative in the sense that scatterers with different scattering intensities can be segregated. However, the amplitude of the scattered light intensity, or “laser-light scattering event”, as measured by any combination of incident beam direction and collection optics, does not by itself convey topographical information about the LLS; particles and pits cannot be distinguished solely on the basis of single-channel amplitude data. Also, the observer cannot deduce the size, shape, or composition of the LLS from singlechannel amplitude alone.

The amount of light scattered from a localized light scatterer (LLS) that is captured by the SSIS is a function of both the scattering characteristics of the LLS (including the directional dependence of the scattering) and the geometry of the collection optics of the SSIS. For a given wavelength of incident radiation, regular objects of certain sizes exhibit non-linearities, usually in the form of a dip, so that the curve of scattering amplitude as a function of physical size of the scatterer may not be monotonic. Thus, similar objects with modest variations in physical size can"

Different materials may exhibit non-linearities at different sizes. Because these effects tend to be less pronounced for irregular particles such as may be found on polished wafer surfaces, instrument calibration is usually carried out by avoiding the sizes of spheres that correspond to a dip. Sometimes, however, it is desired to fully characterize the response of the SSIS to a particular type of scatterer; in this case, the calibration can be carried out with a set of particles with sizes that cover the desired range with adequate density to ensure that any non-linearities in the scattering amplitude-size curve are detected. 5.3.14 nominal sphere size distribution — the stated diameter distribution of a suspension of PSL spheres of a certified diameter used in the calibration of SSISs. 5.3.14.1 Discussion — The nominal sphere size distribution is usually expressed as the standard"

This change in philosophy has come about for two reasons. First, in many situations, there is actually some advantage to creating depositions with different characteristics from those of the bulk PSL spheres.

Secondly, most deposition systems produce at least minor changes in diameter distributions that are difficult to eliminate in any case. As a result, this philosophical change is being introduced to increase the accuracy with which SSIS calibration can be accomplished. R1-1.2 Deposition systems generally consist of an atomizer (which takes the particles from a liquid suspension to an air droplet mist), followed by a dryer (so that droplets of the source liquid do not reach the wafer), and often include a bipolar charger and differential mobility analyzer (or DMA) to size and/or filter the particles. The changes in characteristics from source to deposition are due to at least three distinct causes.

Although this is not as important for larger particles greater than $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ , it is highly recommended that a PSL suspension with low non-volatiles be used to reduce this source of error. If the DMA is operated in a manner that meets the requirement of this practice for distributions with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of no more than $5 \\%$ of the peak diameter, then many source distributions are narrowed by the DMA. This is true because many PSL sphere sources with diameters less than $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { {"

The $5 \\%$ FWHM value does not impose severe difficulties on the DMA design. R1-1.3 In addition to narrowing the deposition diameter distributions, these standards address related accuracy issues. These are easily understood by considering the filtering process of the DMA on the source distribution as shown in Figure R1-1. The left hand side of the figure represents a rather broad PSL source diameter distribution. Notice that it is not symmetrical, which makes the mean (or average) diameter different from the modal (or peak) diameter. Typically PSL manufacturers have given the mean diameter with their product and industry users have assigned this value as the diameter for that deposition. Unfortunately depositions are generally made at the peak diameter. This is because the peak is easily found by scanning the DMA through the source"

The center section of the figure shows the ideal triangular transfer function of the DMA fixed at some center diameter. By adjusting airflows through the DMA, the FWHM can be changed.

The analytical procedure is time-consuming and costly, hence it is generally confined to e.g. biannual control measurements of the supplier to ensure that raw material supply, synthesis and crystal growth procedures are stable. By virtue of the compensation process (see Section 4.11) the donor concentration [D], including intrinsic defects, is implicitly controlled by specifying [C], [EL2] and ρ. 5.12 The total concentration of impurities acting as acceptors is measured by SSMS or GDMS. The analytical procedure is time-consuming and costly, hence is generally confined to regular control measurements of the supplier to ensure that raw material supply and the synthesis and crystal growth procedures are stable. The dominant contribution usually is C, intentionally doped to control ρ.
