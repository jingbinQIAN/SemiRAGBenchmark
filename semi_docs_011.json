The standardization of these technologies is also necessary to provide the CIM/FA infrastructure in a short period of time at a low cost. Since the standards will have to cover a wide range of production equipment, communication hardware, and software tools, it is very important that the standards have a high degree of compatibility. In order to improve the compatibility, this guide provides a functional structure model of an Equipment Front End Module (EFEM) that handles carriers and substrates at the interface between the factory material handling system and the process equipment. 1.2 The major purposes of this guide are as follows: 1) provide a common understanding of functions of EFEM (Equipment Front End Module) and associated interfaces between functional elements (components with particular"

However, this system (of single-wafer box and SWIF) must have box placement sensing pads as specified in SEMI E47.1 FOUP standards Requirements Section 6.12.

Thus, batch wafer handlers will probably not work with this system. 6.6 Wafer Clearances — The clearance below the middle wafer must be the same as the clearance below the bottom wafer in an ordinary FOUP (z8 minus z6, both from SEMI E1.9), and the clearance above the middle wafer must be the same as the clearance above the top wafer in an"

One possible example of such a system (of single-wafer box and SWIF) is shown in Figures 1 and 2 (with vertical clearances indicated). 6.7 SWIF Sensing — It is possible that the SWIF is not removed from the load port when single-wafer boxes are removed and replaced on the SWIF. However, when the single-wafer box is removed from the SWIF, all of the carrier sensing pads (defined in Section 6.6 of SEMI E1.9) on the bottom of the SWIF must be raised (so that the load port can sense a change of carriers by its carrier placement sensor, if any).
