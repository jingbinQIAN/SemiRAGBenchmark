However, when referring to other SEMI standards used in this specification, the reader should allow for some editorial exceptions in order to apply the specification to FPD equipment. For example, if another SEMI specification referenced here uses the term “wafer”, the reader can assume that this also applies to FPD substrates, and likewise with “silicon” and glass or plastic. These minor differences in no way impact the interpretation or implementation of those standards in FPD manufacturing equipment and factory systems.  \n3.2  This guide is not an all-inclusi ve list of applicable standards, but is a starting point for defining requirements of these equipment automation functions, and a guideline for implementation."

However, it is more appropriate to identify the system as “SECS-I Compliant” and/or “SECS-II” compliant. This distinction is important because SECSII can be implemented independently from SECS-I. The term “SECS Compliant” is ambiguous, but commonly used. It is suggested that the following terms be used instead to describe the equipment and host communication interface. 5.1.2 SECS-I Compliant — This term is used to identify a system that complies completely with SEMI E4. 5.1.3 SECS-II Compliant — This ter m is used to identify a system that complies completely with SEMI E5. 5.1.4 HSMS Compliant — This term is used to describe systems which comply with SEMI E37 (HSMS) and either SEMI E37.1 (HSMS-SS) or SEMI E37.2 (HSMS-GS)"

Although more modern data communication specifications are available (e.g. HTML), SECS-II has unique aspects which are valuable in microelectronics manufacturing. Also, there are many available “off-the-shelf” software packages which provide the SECS-II feature set. 7.2 Furthermore, for maximum co mpatibility and reliability, the implementation of any optional SEMI E5 objects (data items, variable items, messages, etc.) on the system should meet the requirements of SEMI E5. For example, if an FPD system implements the S7,F3 message, it must do so in compliance with SEMI E5 to be considered “SECS-II Compliant”. It is possible to implement “user-defined” SECS-II messages, and it is allowed by SEMI E5. 7.3 However, it is usually unneces sary to use such custom SECS-II messages.

End-users will make certain assumptions about the capabilities of “GEM” systems based on the requirements of SEMI E30. 8.1.2 SEMI E30 is applicable to FPD manufacturing equipment. FPD equipment suppliers may choose to implement GEM. In order for FPD equipment to be “GEM Compliant” or “Fully GEM Capable”, it must meet the requirements of SEMI E30 without exception. However, it may not be necessary to implement certain optional GEM capabilities for effective FPD automation. 8.1.3 The implementation of SEMI E30, or lack thereof, is usually a point of much negotiation between equipment supplier and end-user.

For this reason, when panel makers and their users who conduct business with a fixed quality level set a mura acceptance level, limit samples are used as necessary. 1.3 Operational problems with limit samples include: Level of mura cannot be determined without viewing the sample. Due to this, it is not possible to express the level via written documentation or telephone. The sample settings are subjectively decided by the setter, and lack objectivity.

Using the ten-key pad, the subjects adjusted the luminance of mura, to a point “where mura can just no longer be detected” (referred to as “jnd”: just noticeable difference below) and to a “point where mura can clearly be detected” (referred to as “distinct” below), recording the contrasts at these times.

The larger the area of the mura, the smaller jnd contrast (C jnd) became. (Muras are more visible as area becomes larger) Muras with a width of one pixel, compared to other muras, require nearly 1.5 to 2 times the contrast. (Muras with a width of one pixel are difficult to detect) Comparing the distribution between the subjects, there was no difference between the Expert and Novice groups for jnd contrast (C jnd) Compared to the Expert group, the Novice group had a larger distribution for distinct contrast. R1-3.2 The relation between mura area and jnd contrast showed the same trend as in past experience[1], and the quality of reproducibility was confirmed. Therefore at this point, for the sake of standardization, we examined the function for mura area, and tried linear regression for it with jnd contrast. Figure 1 shows the results. When the horizontal axis is $\\frac { 1 } { S ^ { 0 . 3 3 } }$ (S is mura area in $\\mathrm {"

R1-3.3 This bold line shows the relation between mura area and contrast at the point where the mura becomes just not detectable (jnd), and if area is determined, then jnd contrast (C jnd) can be figured out. In Figure 1, $\\bigcirc$ is a mura with a width of one pixel, and $\\bullet$ represents other muras (not one pixel wide) respectively representing the averages of the 16 subjects. As noted above in 2), a mura with a width of one pixel tends to be slightly different, which is why they were handled separately. Also considering past experiment results, when viewing distance is $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , the $0 . 3 \\mathrm { m m }$ level seems to be the boundary.

Figure 1 shows straight lines made up of 2.0 jnd and 3.0 jnd. $\\times$ is distinct contrast for the Expert group, but in cases besides 1-pixel wide muras, it can be understood to be distributed slightly above the 2.0 jnd straight line. R1-3.5 This indicates that the straight-line relationship of Figure 1 is not only jnd level, but also consists of visible contrast level. Accordingly, with the bold line jnd as a standard, mura quality level can be expressed by n in n x jnd. From the experiment results this time, from 3.0 being a level slightly above distinct, it can be thought that it is desirable to operate using a range of levels 1.0 to 3.0."

Luminance should be expressed in a unit such as candelas per meter squared $[ \\mathrm { c d } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } ]$ .  This luminance is the value measured at one center point or average value at several testing points. Generally, the lamp current of BLU should be set to typical lamp current.  If the lamp current value has fluctuation state, the user should wait by stable state.  The measurements are performed in the dark room under standard measuring conditions and design viewing direction."

    "content": "Title: SEMI D33-0703 MEASURING METHOD OF OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR BACKLIGHT UNIT - # 6.3.3  Luminance Uniformity\n\nContent: 6.3.3.1 Luminance uniformity is a measure of how well the luminance remains constant over the surface of the active area and it is a closely related measurement to luminance itself. Backlights are particularly liable to have the non-uniformity characteristics. The measuring method is similar to the luminance measuring method. In this measurement, it is important to determine the testing position. The determination of the testing position occur some different testing result. In this standard, we calculate the uniformity with the ratio of max luminance and min luminance level. The simple formulas are below. There are two formulas for uniformity. These formulas explain the non-uniformity concept, but they very popular with related industry. Measuring position in luminance uniformity formula: $$ \\begin{array} { l } { { U n i f o r m i t y ( \\% ) = ( \\displaystyle \\frac { L _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } } - L _ { \\operatorname* { m i n } } } { L _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } } } ) \\times 1 0 0 } } \\\\ { { \\phantom {"

    "title": "SEMI D33-0703 MEASURING METHOD OF OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR BACKLIGHT UNIT - # 6.3.4  Color",
    "content": "6.3.4.1  In this standard, color coordinate systems are the 1931 or 1976 CIE systems. CIE1931 use the $\\mathbf { \\epsilon } ^ { \\bullet } \\mathbf { x } ^ { \\bullet }$ and ‘y’ coordination and CIE1976 use $\\mathrm { \\mathbf { u } } ^ { \\prime }$ and v’ coordination. The relation between CIE1931 to CIE1976 is below:  \n$$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle u ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { 4 X } { X + 1 5 Y + 3 Z } = \\frac { 4 x } { - 2 x + 1 2 y + 3 } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle v ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { 9 Y } { X + 1 5 Y + 3 Z } = \\frac { 9 y } { - 2 x + 1 2 y + 3 } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle x = \\frac { 2 7 u ^ { \\prime } } { 1 8 u ^ { \\prime } - 4 8 \\nu ^ { * } + 3 6 } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle y = \\frac { 1 2 \\nu ^ { \\prime } } { 1 8 u ^ { \\prime } - 4 8 \\nu ^ { * } + 3 6 } } \\end{array}\n$$  \n6.3.4.2  Generally, because the light source of BLU is a discontinue wavelength, color should be measured by spectroradiometer. It is more accurate than filter colorimeter for color measuring.  In this standard, the measuring distance and viewing direction are the same with the luminance testing method."

It means how the displays have the consistent chromaticity. In case of the color uniformity, we use the $\\mathrm { \\mathbf { u } } ^ { \\prime }$ and $\\mathbf { v } ^ { \\star }$ coordinates from CIE1976. The reference point is center position. It is referenced the ∆u’v’ formula.
