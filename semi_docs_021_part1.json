The first layer, identity, is supported by the element “E36Item”, which identifies the tagged information as complying with SEMI E36-0699. The second layer, metadata, provides the tags most important for managing and retrieving the documentation.  \n5.2  Level two compliance is achieved by the inclusion of one or more of the metadata elements described below.\nFor elements inserted for Level 2 compliance, all attributes are considered optional, unless otherwise indicated.  \n5.3  Attributes associated with the elements appearing below are multi-valued; no restrictions on cardinality are expressed or implied.  If an attribute has multiple values, the attributes statement must be repeated, once for each value.\n\nSEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 5.4  Element Name — E36Item (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 5.4  Element Name — E36Item\n\nContent: 5.4.1 Element Description — This element serves as the basic super type from which, by default, all of the elements in the SEMI E36 tag set are derived. An E36Item element can contain arbitrary content. The E36Item element has the following attributes: ItemID — Globally unique URI1 used to distinguish each E36Item. This attribute partitions the space of E36Items into equivalence classes, each of which represents an individual item of information. EditionID — Globally unique URI2 used to distinguish each member of an equivalence class, as defined by the ItemID. This attribute is used to control variation within an equivalence class. 5.4.2 Metadata The following namespaces are defined for E36Item metadata: 5.4.2.1 DC — representing the Dublin Core3 namespace. 5.4.2.2 RDF — representing the Resource Description Framework namespace. 5.4.2.3 e36base — representing the E36 basic namespace. 5.4.3 In the DC namespace, standard interpretations of the following items of metadata are\n\nSEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 5.4  Element Name — E36Item (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 5.4  Element Name — E36Item\n\nContent: utilized: 5.4.3.1 Title 5.4.3.2 Publisher 5.4.3.3 Subject 5.4.3.4 Description 5.4.3.5 Format 5.4.3.6 Source 5.4.3.7 Language 5.4.3.8 Rights 5.4.4 In the e36base namespace, the following items of metadata are utilized: 5.4.4.1 ReleaseDate — This item is a Date describing the moment when the content contained in the tag becomes valid.

First, organizing the work into these segments makes each segment more coherent. Next, layering the segments provides a flexible means for adopting the standard incrementally. 6.1.1 The metadata depends on the identity layer. The internal structure layer implies the identity layer. 6.2 Identifiers The use of identifiers is critical in the design. Each of the levels requires them to function. The reason is that being able to unambiguously identify an item independently of the item itself enables elegant solutions to many problems: Item Versioning Item Security Item Lookup Distributed Metadata Efficient Distribution 6.3 Externalizing Information Many XML initiatives focus on rigorously defining rich structure for Elements. The current approach has been the opposite, to externalize as much structure as possible. 6.3.1 This approach is to promote flexibility and simplicity. The objective was to provide a small set of\n\nSEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 6  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 6  Requirements\n\nContent: powerful modeling primitives from which richer models may be built. Providing a mechanism for distributing related information among different locations allows systems to capitalize on this property for economic efficiency. The metadata model allows content to be stored in some sort of native XML format, while associated metadata is maintained in a relational database system. This creates more options for users. 6.4 Utilizing RDF as the Basis for Metadata Level 2 type and metadata is based on the existing XML standard for metadata called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF provides a very simple, but very powerful model of information that is easy to understand and process. RDF allows flexible extension of the metadata standard without having to modify existing schema definitions. This will allow users to incorporate future key learnings into the standard. 6.5 Tag and Attribute Selection A large number of tags and attributes were considered for possible inclusion in the standard.\n\nSEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 6  Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # 6  Requirements\n\nContent: In making decisions about which of the many possibilities to choose as the basis of this work, several factors were considered. First representative users of the information were interviewed to identify concepts and relationships that they considered to be important and valuable. Tags resulting from this work were given high priority relative to tags that derived from other sources. Next, semantic or conceptual tags were favored over tags derived from structural or physical properties of the service documents. Finally, tags determined to have broad utility were chosen in favor of tags considered useful in only a limited context. 6.5.1 Once a reasonable set of tags were selected for inclusion, a set of attributes was produced for those tags. The basic approach was to determine an attribute set that was necessary and sufficient for making the information captured by the tags economical to produce and beneficial to end users.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on March 14, 2004.\n\nSEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # R1-1  Identity and Metadata Example (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # R1-1  Identity and Metadata Example\n\nContent: R1-1.1 This section illustrates the use of the identity and metadata defined in the standard. The material shown below was produced using a tool called the “RDF Validation Service” available on the web at http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/. Given a candidate XML/RDF document, the tool will first validate the document for compliance with the RDF specification. Next, the document is parsed and represented in three alternative forms: the original XML version, a tabular version, and a graphical version. R1-1.2 The graph shows that the sample RDF document contains five elements, as shown by the five ellipses on the left side of the graphic. These items are the subjects of the RDF model. These are the items we are associating metadata. Each subject has a URI embedded within; this URI points to the content that the subject refers to. This binds metadata to a subject in a completely different context than that in which the subject’s content is developed. R1-1.3 Emanating from the\n\nSEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # R1-1  Identity and Metadata Example (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E36.1-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INFORMATION TAGGING STANDARD E36 - # R1-1  Identity and Metadata Example\n\nContent: subjects are arrows. Each of these arrows defines a relationship between the subject and another information item. The nature of the relationship is indicated as a label on the arc and corresponds to one of the relationships defined in the E36 RDF model. R1-1.4 These arrows terminate on graphics representing the object of the relationship. In cases where the terminating graphic is a box, the object of the relationship is a literal value such as a number, date, or phrase. When the terminating graphic is an oval, this is an indication that the object of the relationship is another resource.

HSMS uses TCP/IP stream support, which provides reliable two way simultaneous transmision of streams of contiguous bytes. It can be used as a replacement for SECS-I communication as well as other more advanced communications environments. The procedure for HSMS communications parallels the more familiar SECS-I communications it replaces. The following steps are followed for any communications (HSMS or otherwise): 1. Obtain a communications link between two entities. In SECS-I, this is the RS232 wire physically connecting host and equipment. In HSMS, the link is a TCP/IP connection obtained by the standard TCP/IP connect procedure. Note that the abstract term “entity” is used instead of “host” or “equipment.” This is because, while HSMS is used for SECS-I replacement, it has more general applications as well. In a SECS-I\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5  HSMS Overview and State Diagram (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5  HSMS Overview and State Diagram\n\nContent: replacement application, the “host” is an “entity” and the “equipment” is an “entity.” 2. Establish the application protocol conventions to be used for exchanging data messages between two entities. For SECS-I, this step is implicit in the fact that semiconductor equipment is physically connected on the two ends of the wire: the protocol is SECS-II. In the case of HSMS, the communications link is a dynamically established TCP/IP connection on a physical link which may be shared with many other TCP/IP connections using protocols other than HSMS or connections using non TCP/IP protocols. HSMS adds a message exchange (called the Select procedure) which is used to confirm to both entities that the particular TCP/IP connection is to be used exlusively for HSMS communications. 3. Exchange Data. This is the normal intended purpose of the communications link. In both SECS-I and HSMS, the procedure is to exchange SECS-II encoded messages for the control of semiconductor equipment and/or processes. Data exchange\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5  HSMS Overview and State Diagram (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5  HSMS Overview and State Diagram\n\nContent: normally continues until one or both of the entities are taken off-line for equipmentspecific purposes, such as maintenance. 4. Formally end communications. In SECS-I, there is no formal requirement here; the equipment to be taken off-line stops communicating. In HSMS, a message exchange (either the “bilateral” Deselect procedure or the “unilateral” separate procedure) is used for both parties to confirm that the TCP/IP connection is no longer needed for HSMS communications. 5. Break the communications link. In SECS-I, this is done by physically unplugging the host or equipment from the communications cable, which only occurs during repair or physical reconfiguration of the factory network environment. In HSMS, since it uses the dynamic connection environment of TCP/IP, the TCP/IP connection is logically broken via a release or a disconnect procedure without any physical disconnect from the network medium. Two additional procedures, of a diagnostic nature, are supported in HSMS, which are generally not\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5  HSMS Overview and State Diagram (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5  HSMS Overview and State Diagram\n\nContent: required by a simple SECS-I link or a SECS-I direct replacement. These follow: 1. Linktest. This procedure provides a simple confirmation of connection integrity. 2. Reject. Because HSMS is intended to be extended to protocols other than just SECS-II (by means of subsidiary standards), it is possible that two entities can be connected (due to a configuration error) which use incompatible subsidiary standards. Also, during initial implementation, incorrect message types may be sent, or they may be sent out of order due to software bugs. The reject procedure is used to indicate such an occurrence. 5.1 HSMS Connection State Diagram — The HSMS state machine is illustrated in the diagram below. The behavior described in this diagram defines the basic requirements of HSMS: subsidiary standards may further extend these or other states.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5.2  State Descriptions\n\n5.2.1  NOT CONNECTED — The entity is ready to listen for or initiate TCP/IP connections but either has not yet established any connections or all previously established TCP/IP connections have been terminated.  \n5.2.2  CONNECTED — A TCP/IP connection has been established. This state has two substates, NOT SELECTED and SELECTED.  \n5.2.2.1  NOT SELECTED — A substate of CONNECTED in which no HSMS session has been established or any previously established HSMS session has ended.  \n5.2.2.2  SELECTED — A substate of CONNECTED in which at least one HSMS session has been established.  This is the normal “operating” state of HSMS: data messages may be exchanged in this state. It is highlighted by a heavy outline in the state diagram.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 5.3  State Transition Table\n\nTable 1\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6  Use of TCP/IP\n\n6.1  TCP/IP API — The specification of a required TCP Application Program Interface (API) for use in implementations is outside the scope of HSMS. A given HSMS implementation may use any TCP/IP API — sockets, TLI (Transport Layer Interface), etc. — appropriate to the intended hardware and software platform, as long as it provides interoperable TCP/IP streams protocol on the network.  \nThe appendix contains examples of the TCP/IP procedures referenced in this standard and sample scenarios using both the TLI (POSIX standard 1003.12) and the popular BSD socket model for TCP/IP communication.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.2  TCP/IP Network Addressing Conventions\n\n6.2.1  IP Addresses Each physical TCP/IP connection to a given Local Area Network (LAN) must have a unique IP Address. IP Addresses must be assignable at installation time, and an HSMS implementation cannot select a fixed IP Address. A typical IP Address is 192.9.200.1.  \nIP imposes restrictions on these numbers which are outside the scope of the HSMS protocol. Consult Section 2.3 of RFC 791, Internet Protocol (IP) in Section 3.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.2.2  TCP Port Numbers — A TCP Port Number can be considered as an extension of the IP Address.\n\nHSMS implementations should allow configuring TCP Port to the full range of the TCP/IP implementation used.  A typical TCP Port Number is 5000.  \nConventions have been established for selecting TCP Port Numbers which are outside the scope of the HSMS protocol. Consult RFC 793, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in Section 3.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection\n\nContent: 6.3.1 Connect Modes The procedures for establishing a TCP/IP connection are defined in RFC 793. However, not all the procedures defined by RFC 793 are supported by commonly available APIs. In particular, while RFC 793 permits both entities to initiate the connection simultaneously, this feature is rarely supported in available APIs. Therefore, HSMS restricts an entity to one of the following modes: Passive Mode. The Passive mode is used when the local entity listens for and accepts a connect procedure initiated by the Remote Entity. Active Mode. The Active mode is used when the connect procedure is initiated by the Local Entity. The appendix provides an example of how an entity may operate alternately in the active and passive modes to achieve greater flexibility in establishing communications. 6.3.2 Passive Mode Connect Procedure — The procedure followed by the Passive Local Entity is defined in RFC 793. It is summarized as follows: 1. Obtain a connection endpoint and bind it to a published port. 2.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection\n\nContent: Listen for an incoming connect request to the published port from a remote entity. 3. Upon receipt of a connect request, acknowledge it and indicate acceptance of the connection. At this point, the connect procedure has completed successfully, and the CONNECTED state is entered (Section 5). These procedures are carried out through the API of the local entity' s implementation of TCP/IP. The appendices provide the API-specific procedures for the above steps using both TLI and BSD. NOTE: A failure may occur during the above steps. The reason for failure may be local entity-specific or may be due to a lack of any connect request after a local entity-specific timeout. The action to be taken (for example: return to step 1 to retry) is a local entity-specific issue. NOTE: See Section 9, Special Considerations, for issues relating to multiple connection requests to the same passive mode entity. 6.3.3 Active Mode Connect Procedure The procedure followed by the Active Local Entity is defined in RFC 793. It is\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection\n\nContent: summarized as follows: 1. Obtain a connection endpoint. 2. Initiate a connection to the published port of a passive mode remote entity. 3. Wait for the receipt of the acknowledge and the acceptance of the connect request from the remote entity. Receipt of the acceptance from the remote entity indicates successful completion of the connect procedure, and the CONNECTED state is entered (Section 5). These procedures are carried out through the API of the local entity' s implementation of TCP/IP. The appendix provides the API-specific procedures for the above steps using both TLI and BSD. NOTE: A failure may occur during the above steps. The reason for failure may be local entity-specific or may be due to a lack of any accept message after a local entity-specific timeout. The action to be taken is a local entity-specific issue. If, however, the local entity intends to retry the connection, it should do so subject to the T5 connect separation timeout (see “Special Considerations”). 6.4 Terminating a TCP/IP\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 6.3  Establishing a TCP/IP Connection\n\nContent: Connection — Connection termination is the logical inverse of Connection establishment. From the Local Entity' s perspective, a TCP/IP connection may be broken at any time. However, HSMS only permits termination of the connection when the connection is in the NOT SELECTED substate of the CONNECTED state. The procedures for termination of a connection are defined in RFC 793. Either entity may initiate termination of the connection. The NOT CONNECTED state is entered, indicating the end of HSMS communications. The appendix illustrates the procedures for both release and disconnect using the TLI and BSD APIs.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures\n\nContent: HSMS defines the procedures for all message exchange between entities across the TCP/IP connection established according to the procedures in the previous section. As explained in the overview, once the connection is established, the two entities establish HSMS communications with the Select procedure. Then data messages may be exchanged in either direction at any time. When the entities wish to end HSMS communications, the Deselect or Separate procedure is used to end HSMS communications. 7.1 Sending and Receiving HSMS Messages — All HSMS procedures involve the exchange of HSMS messages. These messages are sent and received as TCP/IP streams using the previously established TCP/IP connection at standard priority. In particular, the use of “Urgent” data is not supported under HSMS (see RFC 793 for more information on send and receive procedures). The appendix gives examples of sending and receiving HSMS messages using both TLI and BSD socket APIs. 7.2 Select Procedure — The Select procedure is used to\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures\n\nContent: establish HSMS communications on a TCP/IP connection using the Select.req and Select.rsp messages in a control transaction. Although HSMS permits Select at any time in the CONNECTED state, subsidiary standards may further require the connection to be in the NOT SELECTED substate (see “Special Considerations”). 7.2.1 Initiator Procedure — The procedure followed by the initiator is as follows. 1. The initiator of the select procedure sends the Select.req message to the responding entity. 2. If the initiator receives a Select.rsp with a Select Status of 0, The HSMS Select procedure completes successfully and the SELECTED state is entered (see Section 5). 3. If the initiator receives a Select.rsp with a non-zero Select Status, the Select completes unsuccessfully (no state transitions). 4. If the T6 timeout expires in the initiator before receipt of a Select.rsp, it is considered a communications failure (see “Special Considerations”). 7.2.2 Responding Entity Procedure — The procedure followed by the responding\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures\n\nContent: entity is as follows. 1. The responding entity receives the Select.req. 2. If the responding entity is able to accept the select, it transmits the Select.rsp with a Select Status of 0. The HSMS Select Procedure for the responding entity is successfully completed, and the SELECTED state is entered (see Section 5). 3. If the responding entity is unable to permit the select, it transmits the Select.rsp with a non-zero Select Status. The HSMS Select Procedure for the responding entity completes unsuccessfully (no state transitions). 7.2.3 Simultaneous Select Procedures — If the subsidiary standards do not restrict the use of the Select, it is possible that both entities simultaneously initiate Select Procedures with identical SessionID’s. In such a case, each entity will accept the other entity' s select request by responding with a Select.rsp. 7.3 Data Procedure — HSMS data messages may be initiated by either entity as long as the connection is in the SELECTED state. Receipt of a data message when not in the\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7  HSMS Message Exchange Procedures\n\nContent: SELECTED state will result in a reject procedure (see Section 7.7). Data messages may be further defined as part of a data transaction as either a “Primary” or “Reply” data message. In a data transaction, the initiator of the transaction sends a primary message to the responding entity. If the Primary message indicates that a reply is expected, a Reply message is sent by the responding entity in response to the Primary. The following types of Data Transactions are supported: 1. Primary Message with reply expected and the associated Reply Message. 2. Primary Message with no reply expected. The specific procedures for these transactions are determined by the application layer and are subject to other standards (for example, E5 and E30 for GEM equipment using SECS-II encoded messages). The applicable upper layer standard is identified by the message type. The type is determined from the specific format defined in Section 8. The normal type for HSMS messages is SECS-II text.

The initiator of the Deselect procedure sends the Deselect.req message to the responding entity.\n2. If the initiator receives a Deselect.rsp with a Deselect Status of 0, its Deselect procedure terminates successfully.  The NOT SELECTED state is entered (see Section 5).\n3. If the initiator receives a Deselect.rsp with a nonzero Deselect Status, its Deselect procedure terminates unsuccessfully.  No state change occurs.\n4. If the T6 timeout expires in the initiator before receipt of a Deselect.rsp, it is considered a communications failure (see “Special Considerations”).\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.4.2  Responding Entity Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.4.2  Responding Entity Procedure\n\nContent: 1. The responding entity receives the Deselect.req message. 2. If the responding entity is in the SELECTED state, and if it is able to permit the Deselect, it responds using the Deselect.rsp with a zero response code. The responding entity' s Deselect procedure completes successfully. The NOT SELECTED state is entered (see Section 5). 3. If the responding entity is unable to permit the Deselect, either because it is not in the SELECTED state or because local conditions do not permit the Deselect, it responds using the Deselect.rsp with a non-zero response code. The responding entity' s Deselect procedure terminates unsuccessfully. No state change occurs. 7.4.3 Simultaneous Deselect Procedures — If the subsidiary standards do not restrict the use of the Deselect, it is possible that both entities simultaneously initiate Deselect Procedures with identical SessionID’s. In such a case, each entity will accept the other entity' s Deselect request by responding with the deselect.rsp.

Its use is valid anytime in the CONNECTED state.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.5.1  Initiator Procedure\n\n1. The initiator of the Linktest procedure sends the Linktest.req message to the responding entity.\n2. If the initiator receives a Linktest.rsp within the T6 timeout, the Linktest is successfully completed.\n3. If the T6 timeout expires in the initiator before receipt of a Linktest.rsp, it is considered a communications failure (see “Special Considerations”).\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.5.2  Responding Entity Procedure\n\n1. The responding entity receives the Linktest.req from the initiator. 2. The responding entity sends a Linktest.rsp.  \n7.6  Separate Procedure — The Separate procedure is used to abruptly terminate HSMS communication for an entity prior to breaking the TCP/IP Connection. HSMS requires that the connection be in the SELECTED state when using Separate. The responding entity does not send a response and is required to terminate communications regardless of its local state. The procedure is as follows.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.6.1  Initiator Procedure\n\n1. The initiator of the select procedure sends the Separate.req message to the responding entity. The initiator' s Separate procedure completes successfully.  The NOT SELECTED state is entered (see Section 5).\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.6.2  Responding Entity Procedure\n\n1. The responding entity receives the Separate.req from the initiator. 2. If the responding entity is in the SELECTED state, its Separate procedure completes successfully. 3. If the responding entity is not in the SELECTED state, the Separate.req is ignored.  \n7.7  Reject Procedure — The Reject procedure is used in response to an otherwise valid HSMS message received in an inappropriate context. Supporting the reject procedure can provide useful diagnostic information during the development of a distributed application using HSMS.  The procedure is as follows:\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 7.7.1  Initiator (Sender of Inappropriate Message) Procedure\n\n1.

The entity receiving the inappropriate message responds with a Reject.req message.  \nHSMS requires the reject procedure for the receipt of a data message in the NOT SELECTED state, or the receipt of a message whose SType or PType (see next section: Message Format) is not defined for the entity receiving the message. Subsidiary standards may define other conditions which require the Reject Procedure. In general, receipt of a reject message is an indication of an improperly configured system or a software programming error.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8  HSMS Message Format\n\nThis section defines the detailed format of the messages used by the procedures in the previous section.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format\n\nContent: 8.1.1 Byte Structure — Within HSMS, a byte contains eight (8) bits. The bits in a byte are numbered from Bit 7 (most significant) to Bit 0 (least significant). 8.1.2 Message Format — An HSMS Message is transmitted as a single contiguous stream of bytes in the following order: Table 2 HSMS Message Format 8.1.3 Message Length — Message Length is a fourbyte unsigned integer value which specifies the length in bytes of the Message Header plus the Message Text. Message Length is transmitted most significant byte (MSB) first and least significant byte (LSB) last. The minimum possible Message Length is 10 (Header only). The maximum possible Message Length is implementation-specific. 8.1.4 Message Header — The Message Header is a tenbyte field. The bytes in the header are numbered from byte 0 (first byte transmitted) to byte 9 (last byte transmitted). The format of the Message Header is as follows: Table 3 HSMS Message Header The physical byte order is designed to correspond as closely as possible to the SECS-I header.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format\n\nContent: 8.1.4.1 Session ID — Session ID is a 16-bit unsigned integer value, which occupies bytes 0 and 1 of the header (byte 0 is MSB, 1 is LSB). Its purpose is to provide an association by reference between control messages (particularly Select and Deselect) and subsequent data messages. It is the role of HSMS subsidiary standards to specify this association further. 8.1.4.2 Header Byte 2 — This header byte is used in different ways for different HSMS messages. For Control Messages (see SType, below) it contains zero or a status code. For a Data Message whose PType (see below) $\\mathbf { \\varepsilon } = 0$ , it contains the W-Bit and SECS Stream. For a Data Message with PType not equal to 0, see “Special Considerations.” 8.1.4.3 Header Byte 3 — This header byte is used in different ways for different HSMS messages. For Control Messages, it contains zero or a status code. For a Data Message whose PType (see below) $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\mathit { \\Theta } 0$ , it contains the SECS Function. For a Data Message with PType not\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format\n\nContent: equal to 0, see “Special Considerations.” 8.1.4.4 PType — PType (Presentation Type) is an 8-bit unsigned integer value which occupies byte 4 of the header. PType is intended as an enumerated type defining the presentation layer message type: how the Message Header and Message Text are encoded. Only PType $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\ 0$ is defined by HSMS to mean SECS-II message encoding. For non-zero PType values, see “Special Considerations.” Table 4 PType 8.1.4.5 SType — SType (Session Type) is a one-byte unsigned integer value which occupies header byte 5. SType is an enumerated type identifying whether this message is an HSMS Data Message (value $\\mathbf { \\varepsilon } = 0$ ) or one of the HSMS Control Messages (other). Those values not explicitly defined in the table are addressed in “Special Considerations.” Table 5 SType 8.1.4.6 System Bytes — System Bytes is a four-byte field occupying header bytes 6-9. System Bytes is used to identify a transaction uniquely among the set of open transactions. Uniqueness — The\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format\n\nContent: System Bytes of a Primary Data Message, Select.req, Deselect.req, or Linktest.req message must be unique from those of all other currently open transactions initiated from the same end of the connection. They must also be unique from those of the most recently completed transaction. Reply Message — The System Bytes of a Reply Data Message must be the same as those of the corresponding Primary Message. The System Bytes of a Select.rsp, Deselect.rsp, or Linktest.rsp must be the same as those of the respective “.req” message. 8.2 HSMS Message Formats by Type — The specific interpretation of the header bytes in an HSMS message is dependent on the specific HSMS message type as defined by the value of the SType field.

The message format is as follows: HSMS Message Length is always 10 (the length of the header alone) or greater. The HSMS Message Header is as follows: Session ID — As described above. Specific value subject to subsidiary standards. Header Byte 2 — For messages with PType value $\\ c =$ 0 (SECS-II), header byte 2 is formatted as shown below. The most significant bit (bit 7) of Header Byte 2 is the W-Bit. In a Primary Message, the W-Bit indicates whether the Primary Message expects a Reply message. A Primary Message which expects a Reply should set the W-Bit to 1. A Primary Message which does not expect a Reply should set the W-Bit to 0. A Reply Message should always set the W-Bit to 0. The low-order 7 bits (bits 6-0) of Header Byte 2 contain the SECS Stream for the message. The Stream is a 7-bit unsigned integer value, which identifies a major topic of the message, and its use is defined within SEMI E5 (SECS-II). Header Byte 3 — For messages whose PType value\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 8.1  General Message Format\n\nContent: $\\scriptstyle = 0$ , header Byte 3 contains the SECS Function for the message. The Function is an 8-bit unsigned integer value which identifies a minor topic of the message (within the Stream), and its use is defined within SEMI E5 (SECS-II). The least significant bit (bit 0) of the Function defines whether the Data Message is Primary or Reply; the value 1 indicates Primary and the value 0 indicates Reply. PType — Set PType $= 0$ for SECS-II messages. SType $= 0$ System Bytes — For PType $= 0$ (SECS-II), the following definition applies. For a Primary Message, System Bytes contain a value uniquely identifying this transaction from all other open transactions initiated from the same end of the Connection. For a Reply Message, System Bytes contain the same value as the corresponding Primary Message. The HSMS Message Text contains the text of the Data Message (if any), formatted as specified by the PType field. For PType $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\ 0$ , the text will be formatted as SECS-II messages.

Upon termination of the connection, the entity may, at this point, attempt to reestablish communications.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations\n\nContent: 8.2.9 SType $\\scriptstyle = 9$ : Separate.req — An HSMS message with SType $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\mathit { \\Theta } 9$ is used to terminate HSMS communications immediately. With the exception of the SType value, it is identical to the Deselect.req message. Its purpose is to end HSMS communications immediately and without exception. No response is defined. 9.2.1 Connect Separation Time (T5) — The connect procedures initiate some network activity. Frequent use of the active mode connect procedure to the IP Address and Port Number of an entity not yet ready to accept connections can be hostile to TCP/IP operations. The passive mode does not generate network activity and is not considered hostile to the network, although it may affect local application performance. An Entity initiating a connection in the active mode should limit its use of the connect procedure in a manner that is equivalent to the procedure described here. After an active connect procedure terminates by any means (successfully or unsuccessfully), the\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations\n\nContent: Entity should not initiate another active connect procedure (for the same Remote Entity) until the T5 Connect Separation Time has elapsed. The separation of connect operations will be the sum of the T5 Connect Separation Time interval, plus the duration of the connect operation itself. 9.2.2 NOT SELECTED Timeout (T7) — Entry into the NOT SELECTED state is achieved either by state transition $\\# 2$ (establishment of a TCP/IP connection). There is a time limit on how long an entity is required to remain in the NOT SELECTED state before either entering the SELECTED state or by returning to the NOT CONNECTED state. Some entities, particularly those unable to accept more than a single TCP/IP connection, may be impaired in their operation by remaining in their NOT SELECTED state as they will be unavailable for communications with other entities. Such entities shall disconnect the TCP/IP connection (State Transition Event #3) if communication remains in the NOT SELECTED state for longer than the T7 timeout period. 9.2.3\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations\n\nContent: Network Intercharacter Timeout (T8) — Because TCP/IP is a stream rather than a message protocol, it is possible that bytes which are all part of a single HSMS message may be transmitted in separate TCP/IP messages without any violation of the TCP/IP protocol. Since it is possible that these separate messages may be separated by a substantial period of time, the Network Intercharacter Timeout (T8) is defined. T8 is similar in purpose to the SECS-I T1 timer except that the communications issues which necessitate T8 are not entirely in the control of the sender of the message. Therefore, it is defined only in terms of the receiver of the message. In particular, if after receipt of a partial message, the T8 timeout period expires prior to receipt of the complete message, the receiving entity shall consider such case as a communications failure, as defined above. 9.2.4 Multiple Connection Requests Directed to a Single Published Port — Once a passive entity has accepted a connection on its published port, TCP/IP permits\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations\n\nContent: (though does not require) the entity to listen for and accept additional connections directed to the same published port. HSMS permits (though does not require) entities to operate in this manner. However, for the purposes of HSMS compliance, each connection so formed must exhibit the behavior defined in the HSMS state diagram as if it were completely independent of any other connection to the same published port. 9.2.4.1 Rejection of Additional Connection Requests by a Passive Mode Entity — A passive mode entity unable to service more than a single TCP/IP connection for HSMS communications will follow one of these three procedures with respect to additional connection requests. a. Accept the connection, but always respond to any subsequent HSMS select procedures with the Communication Already Active response code. For the purpose of the HSMS State Diagram, the connect procedure terminates successfully (enters CONNECTED state), but HSMS communications are never established (remain in NOT SELECTED substate). This is\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations\n\nContent: the preferred option in that it can provide the most information to the remote entity as to why the connection is refused (see HSMS Select Procedure), but places an addition implementation requirement on the local entity. b. Actively reject the connection request. This can be done in a TLI implementation using the t_snddis procedure. This will cause the connect procedure in the remote entity to terminate unsuccessfully. This option may not be available to all implementations because some API’s, notably some implementations of BSD Sockets, do not provide for initiating an active reject. Note, however, that all TCP/IP implementations, including BSD Sockets, properly respond to an active reject from the remote entity. c. Refuse to listen for or accept the connect request. No action is taken in the local entity: the remote entity’s connect procedure will eventually time out. This option is permitted, but not recommended, as it can cause considerable delay on the part of the remote entity. However, it may be the only\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9  Special Considerations\n\nContent: alternative available to implementations with network resource limitations. The documentation of the passive local entity shall indicate which means it uses to refuse connections.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations\n\nContent: 9.3.1 Control Transactions T6 Control Timeout — A number of the control messages are part of procedures which require a message exchange or transaction: <xx>.req from the initiator of the control service, followed by an <xx>.rsp from the receiver of the <xx>.req in response to it. A control transaction is considered open from the time the <xx>.req request is sent until the time the ${ < } \\mathbf { { X X } } { > }$ .rsp is received. The time a control transaction may remain open is subject to the T6 control transaction timeout. Upon initiation of a control transaction, the local entity should set a timer whose duration is equal to the T6 timeout value. If the transaction is properly closed prior to the expiration of the timer, the timer should be canceled. If the timer expires prior to the proper closing of the transaction, the transaction shall be considered closed by the initiator and considered an HSMS communications failure. 9.3.2 Procedures and “Stateless” Transactions — Most of the HSMS control\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations\n\nContent: procedures involve a transaction: the initiator sends a request message to the responding entity and waits for a response message. The responding entity receives the initiator' s request message and sends a reply. Note that such transactions are “stateless” in the following sense: while the initiator of a transaction is waiting for a response, it may receive a message other than that response, and this message may be any message valid for the state the initiator was in at the time the original transaction was initiated. For example, the two entities may simultaneously initiate transactions. As a result, no states for “TRANSACTION OPEN” or “TRANSACTION NOT OPEN” are reflected in the HSMS state machine. The use of such state information in an implementation is strictly a local entity-specific issue. 9.3.3 Alternative Message Types and Header Byte Values — The HSMS standard does not completely define all possible enumerated values of either the PType or SType field. Further, Header bytes 2 and 3 have a format\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations\n\nContent: determined by the PType for messages whose SType is equal to 0, but is otherwise specified for all other SType values. The message text formatting is defined by the PType as well, but only for data messages. Subsidiary standards must be consistent with this convention. In particular, for $\\mathrm { { \\cal S T y p e } } = 0$ , subsidiary standards defining PType values not equal to 0 may specify both the message text encoding and the interpretation of header bytes 2 and 3. For STypes not equal to 0 but otherwise specified in this standard, PType must $\\mathit { \\Theta } = \\mathit { \\Theta } 0$ , and no message text may be transmitted. For STypes defined in subsidiary standards, the meaning of header bytes 2 and 3 may be specified on a per SType value basis, and these STypes may optionally define message text as long as the PType field is used in a manner consistent with the preceding paragraph. 9.4 SECS-II Considerations — The SECS-II standard (SEMI E5) makes certain references to SECS-I (SEMI E4). This\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations\n\nContent: section addresses issues specific to SECS-II when HSMS is used to transport SECS-II messages. 9.4.1 Reply Matching — When a Sender sends a Primary Message with W-Bit 1 (Reply Expected), the Sender should expect a Reply message whose header meets the following requirements. The SessionID of the Reply must match the SessionID of the Primary Message. The Stream of the Reply must match the Stream of the Primary Message. The Function of the Reply must be one greater than the Function of the Primary Message, or else the Function of the Reply must be 0 (Function Zero Reply). The System Bytes of the Reply must match the System Bytes of the Primary Message. 9.4.1.1 T3 Reply Timeout — The T3 reply timeout is a limit on the length of time that the HSMS message protocol is willing to wait for a Reply message. After sending a Primary Message with W-bit 1 (Reply Expected), the sender must begin a reply timer, initialized to the T3 value. If the sender does not receive the Reply Message before the reply timer expires, then\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 9.3  HSMS-Specific Considerations\n\nContent: a T3 Timeout Error has occurred. The sender should close the transaction and no longer expect the Reply Message. Each open transaction for which a Reply is expected requires a separate reply timer. 9.4.2 Stream 9 Messages — The SECS-II standard defines error messages S9F1, S9F3, S9F5, S9F7, S9F9, and S9F11, with message text containing the SECS-II Data Items MHEAD or SHEAD, which are defined to contain a 10-byte SECS-I block header. When using SECS-II with HSMS, MHEAD and SHEAD should contain the ten bytes of the HSMS Message Header.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # 10  HSMS Documentation\n\nAn HSMS implementation is required to document the following information:  \n1. Method for setting protocol parameters (see Section 10.1).\n2. Range allowed and resolution for each parameter.\n3. The option used for refusing incoming connection requests if the implementation uses the passive mode for TCP/IP connection establishment.\n4. Maximum message size which can be received.\n5. Maximum expected size of messages sent.\n6. Maximum number of supported concurrent open transactions.  \n10.1  Parameter Setting — Implementations of HSMS must provide for installation time setting of the following parameters. The range and resolution of all parameters must be at least as shown in the table. All parameters must be stored in such a manner that the settings will be retained if the power fails or if the system software is reloaded.  \nTable 10  \nNOTE: Parameter defaults shown above are for small networks (10 nodes or less).

The terminology, procedure names, and message names are further explained in the remainder of this document. Also note that either entity may initiate the HSMS Select procedure, the Deselect or Separate procedures, and HSMS Data Messages and Transactions. For convenience, the scenarios show the left-hand entity as the initiator of all transactions. A1-2.1 Begin HSMS Communication — This scenario illustrates the TCP/IP connection procedure, an HSMS select procedure, and exchange of data messages. Note that the data message activity for TCP is for illustrative purposes only. In fact, the actual network activity can vary. For example, even if the data messages are sent as separate calls to t_snd (or write) as shown, the TCP/IP implementation may buffer the header and transmit it in a single packet with the text, or the text may be split into multiple packets.

In such a case, a Local Entity alternately attempts the active mode and passive mode connect procedure until a connection is successfully established. Note that this requires that local entity provide a published port when in the passive phase. The general logic sequence at the Alternating Local Entity is as follows: 1. Attempt an active connect procedure as described in Section 6.3.3 using a timeout value for the t_rcvconnect greater than or equal to the connection separation timeout T5. 2. If the active connect procedure completes successfully, the alternating mode connect procedure completes successfully. 3. If the active connect procedure terminates unsuccessfully, attempt the passive connect procedure as described in 6.3.2 with the timeout for the t_listen greater than or equal to the connection separation timeout T5. 4. If the\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode Connect Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode Connect Procedure\n\nContent: passive connect procedure completes successfully, the alternating mode connect procedure completes successfully as described in 6.3.2. 5. If the passive connect procedure terminates unsuccessfully, the local entity may either return to step 1 to continue the alternating mode procedure or terminate unsuccessfully. The number of times the above sequence of steps are repeated in attempting to form a connection is a local entityspecific issue. A1-3.1 Alternating Mode Cycle Time — The Alternating Mode Cycle Time is the time between iterations of the Connect Procedure of an Alternating Mode entity. In the above procedure, this corresponds to the duration between the initiation of step 1 and completion of step 5 immediately prior to the reinitiation of step 1. This time is implementationdependent. In the case that two entities are both using the Alternating Mode Connect Procedure, it is desirable to ensure that they both have different alternating mode cycle times, to prevent the entities from attempting\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode Connect Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode Connect Procedure\n\nContent: to connect in lock step: both in active mode, then both in passive mode. Adjusting the Alternating Mode Cycle Time can be readily achieved by adjustment of T5 so that the cycle time is different for the two entities: A1-3.2 HSMS Connect Combinations — An entity configured as alternating between active and passive mode can connect with either an passive or active mode remote entity. The list below summarizes the combinations possible using the standard with this particular connections strategy. 1. An Entity “A” configured as ACTIVE can connect to an Entity “B” configured as PASSIVE or as ALTERNATING, and Entity A always establishes the Connection. 2. An Entity “A” configured as ALTERNATING can connect to an Entity “B” configured as PASSIVE, and Entity “A” always establishes the Connection. 3. An Entity “A” configured as ALTERNATING can connect to an Entity “B” configured as ALTERNATING, and either end can establish the Connection. In implementations which use multithreaded connect logic, rather than\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode Connect Procedure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-3 HSMS Alternating Mode Connect Procedure\n\nContent: the sequential logic described in this document, it may be possible that both ends of the HSMS connection attempt to connect at the same time. In this case, there can be two separate TCP/IP connections established, and it is necessary to establish a convention so that one connection is allowed to remain and the other is terminated. 4. It is not allowed to connect two Entities both configured as PASSIVE, or both configured as ACTIVE.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-4  Non-HSMS TCP/IP Protocols\n\nFor typical TCP/IP implementations, HSMS can coexist with other TCP/IP based protocols on the same IP Address. This can be very useful. For example, a SECS-II message transaction could trigger an application to begin a TCP/IP FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sequence to transfer a large data file.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-5  Non-TCP/IP Protocols\n\nThe use of protocols other than TCP/IP on the same network as the HSMS entities is possible but beyond the scope of this standard. Typically, other protocols could be used, provided they have no impact on TCP/IP or HSMS entities on the network.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-6  Multiple LANs\n\nThe HSMS specification considers only a single TCP/IP LAN. Interconnecting multiple LANs is outside the scope of HSMS. However, since TCP/IP implementations typically support such configurations seamlessly through gateways, routers, and similar entities, it may be possible to establish an HSMS Connection across interconnected LAN’s.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-7  TCP/IP Physical Layer\n\nHSMS does not specify the physical layer of IP.  Any physical layer supported by TCP/IP can be used.  Most commonly, TCP/IP implementations use Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) as the physical layer. However, some TCP/IP implementations use other protocols (e.g., Token Bus, IEEE 802.4 and .5). To ensure interoperability within a given installation, it may be desirable to establish additional local standards for the physical layer.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-8  Well-Known TCP/IP Port Numbers\n\nSome TCP/IP-based protocols specify a particular “Well Known” TCP Port Number, which is published and is not available for other protocols. HSMS does not specify a particular “Well Known” TCP Port Number, but instead requires that it be configurable. The IETF defines “Assigned Well Known Port Numbers” in RFC 1340.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-9 Delay between Disconnect and ReConnect\n\nSome TCP/IP systems exhibit problems with applications which terminate a connection and then quickly re-connect, when using identical TCP ports on both ends of the connection. When using such systems, it may be advisable to delay after disconnect before reconnecting. The delay time varies among TCP/IP implementations, but typically can be calculated as twice the “Maximum Segment Lifetime” or MSL. For example, most TCP/IP systems based on BSD (e.g., Sun, AIX) use a MSL of 30 seconds, so a delay of 60 seconds would be appropriate. If rapid connects are required, your application should use a different Port, if allowed by the Connect Mode you are using. In some TCP/IP systems, this problem does not occur.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-10  User-Defined Message Types (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-10  User-Defined Message Types\n\nContent: It is recognized that equipment suppliers may find it desirable to develop additional features not found in the base level HSMS or any defined subsidiary standards. This will be the case during the testing and development of any proposed new subsidiary standard. User-defined extensions through new message types are permissible as long as they are confined to intra-vendor communication interfaces: any inter-vendor communications interface which requires the use of such extensions is considered to be noncompliant with the HSMS standard. If a supplier does deem it necessary to extend or otherwise go outside the standard, the use of “reserved, not used,” values of PType and SType may simplify their implementation by permitting the reuse of the HSMS implementation rather than the implementation and use of a completely separate parallel standard. By remaining within the “reserved, not used,” ranges for SType and PType, the implementor can be assured that future subsidiary standards which define new values for SType\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-10  User-Defined Message Types (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-10  User-Defined Message Types\n\nContent: and/or PType will not conflict with user-defined extensions.\n\nSEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-11  Comparison of SECS-I and HSMS (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37-0303 HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES (HSMS) GENERIC SERVICES - # A1-11  Comparison of SECS-I and HSMS\n\nContent: The following table compares major features of SECS-I and HSMS.

The purpose of this standard is to explicitly limit the capabilities of the HSMS Generic Services to the minimum necessary for this type of application. Specifically, HSMS imposes the following limitations: 1. HSMS-SS eliminates the use of a number of HSMS procedures. Deselect is not to be used to end HSMSSS communications (use Separate instead), and the Reject procedure is optional. 2. HSMS-SS limits certain other procedures such as Select to simplify operation for the specific case of SECS-I replacement. 5.2 The remainder of this document describes these limitations in more detail. 5.3 HSMS-SS State Machine — The HSMS-SS behavior and state machine differ from that specified in the HSMS Generic Services in the following ways: 1. The SelectionCounter defined in HSMS Generic Services is not required. 2. Various transitions are defined\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 5  HSMS-SS Overview and State Machine (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 5  HSMS-SS Overview and State Machine\n\nContent: differently as illustrated in the HSMS-SS state machine illustrated below. 5.4 The HSMS-SS state machine is illustrated in the diagram below.\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 5.5  State Transition Table for Passive Mode Connect\n\nTable 1  HSMS-SS Passive Mode Connect State Transitions\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 5.6   State Transition Table for Active Mode Connect\n\nTable 2  HSMS-SS Active Mode Connect State Transitions  \nTable 3  When HSMS Transactions are Allowed\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 6  HSMS-SS Use of TCP/IP\n\n6.1  As defined in HSMS.\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 7  HSMS-SS Procedures (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 7  HSMS-SS Procedures\n\nContent: 7.1 Select Procedure — The Select Procedure shall only be initiated by the entity establishing the TCP/IP connection in active mode. The Passive Mode Entity shall not initiate the Select Procedure. 7.1.1 The Select Procedure is only permitted in the NOT SELECTED state. It uses a SessionID value of 0xFFFF and implies that all device IDs are available for communication. Immediately following any Select Procedure which fails to complete successfully with a zero Select Status, each Entity must close the TCP/IP connection and transit to the NOT CONNECTED state. 7.2 Data Procedure — The Data Procedure is as defined in HSMS Generic Services. Note that any SessionID value that corresponds with a DeviceID supported by the Local Entity is valid as long as the Local Entity is in the SELECTED state. 7.3 Deselect Procedure — Deselect shall not be used in an HSMS-SS implementation. Communication is ended using the Separate Procedure. 7.4 Linktest Procedure — As defined by HSMS. Under HSMS-SS, the use of\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 7  HSMS-SS Procedures (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 7  HSMS-SS Procedures\n\nContent: Linktest is strictly limited to the SELECTED state. 7.5 Reject Procedure — The Reject Procedure is optional in HSMS communications. Note, however, that any situation which would require the use of the Reject as described in HSMS Generic Services shall be treated as a communications failure in implementations not supporting reject. Specifically, the TCP/IP connection is immediately closed. 7.6 Separate Procedure — Separate shall always use SessionID 0xFFFF (binary, all ones). In HSMS-SS, the Separate.req is valid only in the TCP/IP CONNECTED state and its substates. After either initiating or receiving a Separate.req message, the entity shall immediately close the TCP/IP connection and transit to the TCP/IP NOT CONNECTED state. 7.7 Communications Failures — As defined by HSMS. Note that, in addition to the communications failures defined under HSMS, any violation of the restrictions defined in prior sections of this document are also to be treated as communication failures.\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 8  HSMS-SS Message Format\n\n8.1  Session $I D - \\mathrm { I n }$ HSMS-SS Data Messages, the high-order bit of Session ID is zero, and the low-order 15 bits contain Device ID, a 15-bit unsigned integer value, which occupies the low-order 7 bits (bits 6-0) of byte 0 and all of byte 1 of the header. Device ID is a property of the equipment, and can be viewed as a logical identifier associated with a physical device or sub-entity within the equipment. The precise meaning of “device” or “sub-entity” is equipment-defined. A unit of equipment must have at least one Device ID. Equipment which contains several devices may define a unique Device ID for each device.  \nIn HSMS-SS Control Messages, Session ID will always assume the special value 0xFFFF (all one bits).  \n8.2  PType — All HSMS-SS messages are PType 0 (SECS II encoded) as defined in HSMS.  \n8.3  SType — Only HSMS-defined STypes are permitted in HSMS-SS. User-defined SType messages are not permitted.\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 9  Special Considerations\n\n9.1  Multiblock Messages — For each SECS-II message, the SECS-II standard defines whether that message should be transmitted in SECS-I as a singleblock message or as a multiblock message.  \nThis distinction becomes unimportant with HSMS, which transmits all messages in the same fashion. However, to be compatible with older SECS-I applications, when an HSMS application sends a SECSII message defined as single block, the HSMS Message Length should not exceed 254 bytes (10 byte header plus 244 text bytes).\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 10  HSMS-SS Documentation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # 10  HSMS-SS Documentation\n\nContent: 10.1 An HSMS-SS implementation is required to document the following information in addition to the information required by HSMS. 1. The number of deviceIDs supported and their specific values. 2. Whether or not the implementation supports the normal or the restricted procedure for terminating communications. 3. The setting of the host vs. equipment parameter. 10.2 Host vs. Equipment — Many applications using SECS-II will need to designate one end of the communication link as “Equipment” and the other end as “Host.” HSMS-SS itself does not require configuring of “Host” and “Equipment,” but this parameter may be included in configuration where needed. HSMS can also be used in applications where the distinction between Host and Equipment is not used.

If a unit of equipment can be divided into two or more logical sub-equipments, such as process chambers, or process resources, each of these may have separated session ID. If two or more physical sub-equipments are controlled by an equipment controller or communicated to through a TCP/IP network device, each sub-equipment may have a separate session ID. Such a session can be established once HSMS is selected. Each session ID corresponds to a device ID. R1-1.2 If a unit of equipment has more than one sub-equipment or process resource (e.g. process modules) but the sub-equipment share a common resource (e.g. transfer subsystem), it is not recommended that each sub-equipment have an independent session to communicate with host. Even if the host requests an action to the shared subsystem with a session identifier specific for a sub-equipment, the shared subsystem may not always serve for the subequipment. Since the host expects the shared subsystem to perform the\n\nSEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # R1-1 (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.1-0702HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICE SINGLE SELECTED-SESSION MODE (HSMS-SS or HSMS-SSS) - # R1-1\n\nContent: service for the sub-equipment, an error will occur if it is not possible to perform the service for the designated sub-equipment. See following figure.

That is, if the Equipment has already accepted a Host Connection, but a Host (the same or a different Host) attempts a second Connection, the Equipment will immediately terminate that second Connection attempt. R1-3.2 For specialized applications, an equipment could accept more than one Host Connection. Coordination of activity by multiple hosts is equipment-defined.

HSMS-GS defines no new procedures or message types beyond HSMS Generic Services to provide these services. It does, however, require extensions to the HSMS State machine, in the form of additional state transition definitions and additional state information, which are used by the extended state machine which must be maintained by an HSMS-GS implementation to support the extended state machine. The additional information consists of the following: 1. The Session Entity List 2. The Selected Entity List 3. The Selection Count 5.2 The Session Entity List consists of the set of all Session Entities having individual accessibility within the HSMS-GS entity. The scope of this list is normally the entire HSMS-GS entity. HSMS-GS, however, does not require this scope: the supplier may provide access to\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5  HSMS-GS Overview and State Machine (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5  HSMS-GS Overview and State Machine\n\nContent: HSMS-GS entity through more than one well known port and provide a different Session Entity List for each. 5.3 A Session Entity is any individually addressable subentity within the HSMS-GS entity: for example, a Session Entity may be an individual sub-device in a track system or cluster tool, or may be an individual service provider, such as a data server, within an entity. HSMS-GS only provides the conventions for identifying Session Entities. It places no restrictions on the individual supplier as to what constitues a SessionEntity: the supplier must determine what is the most appropriate for the particular implementation. 5.4 The Selected Entity List is the list of Session Entities actually selected for access on a given TCP/IP connection. When the TCP/IP connection is established (CONNECTED state entered), an empty Selected Entity List is created. Each time, the Select Procedure is used to select a Session Entity, its Session Entity ID is added to the Selected Entity List created\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5  HSMS-GS Overview and State Machine (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5  HSMS-GS Overview and State Machine\n\nContent: for that TCP/IP connection. Each time the Session Entity is deselected via the Deselect or Separate procedures, its Session Entity ID is removed from the Selected Entity List. At any given time on any given TCP/IP connection endpoint, HSMS Data Messages will only be accepted by an entity if the SessionID of the Data Message is equal to any Session Entity ID in the Selected Entity List. 5.5 The Selection Count is simply the number of Session Entity IDs in the Selected Entity List. Its value affects the behavior of the state machine: the transition to NOT SELECTED from SELECT can only take place when the SELECTION COUNT is zero. 5.6 Note that the above lists and count are defined for the purpose of explaining state machine operation only. There is no requirement that any of the above lists and count be explicitly implemented. 5.7 HSMS-GS State Machine — The HSMS-GS state machine is the same as the HSMS Generic Services state machine with the addition of the two new state transitions (#6\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5  HSMS-GS Overview and State Machine (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5  HSMS-GS Overview and State Machine\n\nContent: and #7) and the use of the Selection Count in the other transitions as described in the state transition table below. Table 1 5.8 State Descriptions — The state descriptions are the same as HSMS Generic Services. 5.9 State Transition Table — The state transition table is almost identical with the state transition table for HSMS Generic Services. For convenience, however, the entire table is reproduced and extended here, not just those areas which differ from it.\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  HSMS-GS Use of TCP/IP\n\n6.1  There is no additional HSMS-GS specification for the use of TCP/IP beyond the above mentioned creation of the empty “Selected Entity List” upon entry into the CONNECTED state, NOT SELECTED substate.\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  HSMS-GS Specific Procedures (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  HSMS-GS Specific Procedures\n\nContent: HSMS-GS provides further specification of the following procedures. 7.1 Select Procedure — The select procedure is permitted in both the NOT SELECTED state and the SELECTED state. The procedure for both the initiator and the responding entity is the same as HSMS Generic Services, with the following additional conditions: 1. If the responding entity contains no Session Entity in its Session Entity List whose ID matches the SessionID in the Select.req, a Select Status of No Such Entity is used in the Select.rsp. 2. If the responding entity is unable to provide access to the selected entity because it is usable on only a single TCP/IP connection at any one time and it is already in use on a different TCP/IP connection, a response code of Entity In Use is used in the Select.rsp. 3. If the responding entity finds the SessionID already in its Selected Entity List, a response code of Entity Selected is used in the Select.rsp. 7.1.1 The Select Status values referenced above are all defined in Section\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  HSMS-GS Specific Procedures (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  HSMS-GS Specific Procedures\n\nContent: 8. 7.1.2 If none of the above is true, the Select completes successfully, and a Select Status of 0 is provided in the Select.rsp.

Note that the SessionID of any Data Message must match a SessionID in the SelectedEntityList. If a Data Message is received with a SessionID other than one from the Selected Entity List, a Reject.req message is sent in response by the receiving entity. The reason code will be Entity Not Selected. 7.3 Deselect Procedure — The Deselect procedure is restricted by the following conditions: 1. The SessionID must be in the Selected Entity List. 2. The corresponding SessionEntity is in a state which permits Deselect. This decision is local entity specific and not subject to the HSMS-GS. 7.3.1 If both of the above are true, then the Deselect can proceed.

For example, a cluster tool may use HSMS-GS as the intra-tool communications and HSMS-SS as a GEM interface to the factory. However, implementing a communications facility that is simultaneously HSMS-SS- and HSMS-GScompliant is straightforward. R1-1.2 Assuming that one has implemented an HSMSGS, a simple test can be added to the first Select.req received by the equipment. If it is a Select for any particular SessionID, then operate as HSMS-GS. If its value is a -1, then copy the contents of the Session Entity List corresponding TCP/IP IP address and port number into the Selected Entity List. The Selection Counter would be set to a special value, such as -1, to indicate selection in this manner. The Separate would provide the reverse function.

This standard addresses the communications with and among modules within a cluster tool for automated control.  \n1.2  The module communications s ervices defined here will enable standard interoperability of modules from independent suppliers. Together with other cluster tool standards, this is intended to result in the emergence of standards-compliant interoperable sub-systems. They should allow applications software to be developed which can assume the existence of these services and allow software products to be developed to offer them.  \n1.3  The adoption of the standards described will greatly reduce the effort required to integrate cluster tool components from independent suppliers. Compliance requires support of a minimal, but specific, set of standard services.\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 Cluster tool module communic ations address only communications with and among modules within a cluster tool and not the communications between the cluster tool and the factory. It is the modules and their interrelations which are modeled and not the cluster tool seen as a single equipment. 2.2 This standard does not specify cluster controller functionality (e.g., scheduling, human machine interface, cluster tool recipe editing, and management) but will enable development of standards in this area. The cluster controller is included only to the extent that it represents the entity or entities responsible for supervisory control of the modules in a cluster tool. 2.3 This standard identifies the co mmunications services necessary to achieve automated control of independent transport, process, and cassette modules in a cluster tool. It defines the essential module architecture and the concepts and models on which the communications services are based. 2.4 The scope includes primary co ntrol services for material\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: processing in process modules, material movement within the cluster tool, and material input/output with the factory. Support services also exist to enable recipe handling, resolution of exception conditions, event reporting, and data access. 2.5 A reliable communications env ironment is required for distributed control and is specified in supplementary standards. 2.6 This standard specifies the app lication of more general service standards as required within a cluster tool. This includes the limitations imposed by the cluster tool architecture and the fundamental functionality needed for compliance. The details of the general services, protocols, and communication environment elements are defined in the corresponding standards documents referenced. 2.7 This version of the standard is provisional because a number of the general services on which it relies are not yet standardized. The sections referring to these services have been omitted until they have become standards. These sections will be balloted\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: separately with the corresponding general services and incorporated into this provisional standard. 2.8 The communication between t he cluster tool as a single equipment and the factory is beyond the scope of cluster tool module communications standardized here and should follow the applicable SEMI standards (GEM, MMMS). 2.9 These standards place no restr iction on where, within the cluster tool control architecture, this specific set of definitions is implemented. However, to have complete compliance to the standards in the area of the communications interface definitions, the entire layered structure as outlined in this document must be implemented.\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 3.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E21 — Cluster Tool Module Interface: Mechanical Interface and Wafer Transport Standard SEMI E22 — Cluster Tool Module Interface: Transport Module End Effector Exclusion Volume Standard\nSEMI E30 — Generic Model for Communications and Control of SEMI Equipment (GEM)\nSEMI E32 — Material Movement Management Standard\nSEMI E39 — Object Services Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and Services\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 4  Terminology (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: 4.1 The following terms are those that are appropriate for describing the overall structure of cluster tools.

The “actions” (column 5) include a combination of (1) actions taken upon exit of the current state, (2) actions taken upon entry of the new state, and (3) actions taken which are most closely associated with the transition. No differentiation is made. 5.2 OMT Object Information Mod el — The object models are presented using the Object Modeling Technique\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5.1  Harel State Model (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 5.1  Harel State Model\n\nContent: developed by Rumbaugh, James, et al., in “Object-Oriented Modeling and Design,” Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, $\\mathbb { O } 1 9 9 1$ .

It defines the essential cluster tool architecture and the concepts and models on which the communications services are based. Cluster tools provide a means of grouping a number of independent process steps into a single equipment. The primary function of a cluster tool is material processing. Material enters the cluster tool, undergoes a number of sequential process steps which adds value to the material, and then exits. From a mechanical viewpoint, Cluster Tool Module Interface standards-compliant equipment has a physical structure where process modules and cassette modules are attached in a standardized way to some form of transport module, a robotic material handler operating in an isolated environment. Cassette modules provide the input and output of material for the cluster tool, usually in cassettes. This communications standard enables the distributed\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview\n\nContent: control of these cluster tools, and of other cluster tools and multi-resource equipment which can be decomposed into process, transport, and cassette modules, whether environmentally isolated or not. A basic assumption is made that the primary human-machine interfaces are not located at the individual modules. Communication and control services are specified among service-users and service-providers within a cluster tool. The service-providers are the controlled processing, transfer, intratool port, and intertool port resources in the appropriate modules. The service-users are the application entities responsible for supervisory control and data acquisition within the cluster tool. The services are fully defined in terms of the service-providers, and as such, do not dictate the architecture of the service-user(s). An example of cluster tool control architecture is shown in Figure 1, where the service-user is a single cluster controller platform providing internal scheduling, human-machine interface, and\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview\n\nContent: standardized communications interface to the factory. The communication services include primary control services for material processing in process modules (processing management) and material movement within the cluster tool and material input/output with the factory (material movement management). The cluster controller, which is responsible for supervisory control within the cluster tool, is the service-user of these primary control services. The form of the cluster controller is not dictated. It may be a single platform, distributed, or incorporated with one or more modules. Support services are also specified to enable resolution of exception conditions, recipe handling, event reporting and data access. The decision authority, which is responsible for making error recovery decisions, is the service-user for exception management. Appropriate agents are the designated service-users for the recipe management and event reporting support services. All service-users access data using the Object Services.

Figure 2 shows the full communications stack needed for compliance, where the services are mapped to the communications environment, which is defined in supplementary standards. This standard describes the cluster tool model on which the communications are based. It then defines the application of each of the services required within a cluster tool. This includes limitations imposed by the cluster architecture as well as clear a statement of the fundamental requirements in order to minimize the implementation effort. Connection establishment and maintenance are defined together with the requirements of the communications environment. Communications environment is described in a subsection in order to allow additional options to be standardized in the future. The application notes include factory integration issues and an example scenario of standard\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview\n\nContent: communications for the lifecycle of a single material in a cluster tool. 6.1 Compliance Cluster tool mo dule communications compliance between entities in a cluster tool requires that all applicable exposed interfaces conform to the standards specified in this document. The standardized interfaces are: Process module to Service-user (cluster controller) Transport module to Service-user (cluster controller) Cassette module to Service-user (cluster controller) Transport module to Cassette module Transport module to Process module The exposed interfaces are those which result from a particular partition of the control entities in a cluster tool which are from independent suppliers. Three examples follow: 1. All modules independent, single cluster controller platform: Interfaces are required between the cluster controller and each module, and between the transport module and each process and each cassette module. 2. Material handler, process modules independent, single cluster controller platform: Interfaces are\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 6  Overview\n\nContent: required between the cluster controller and each process module, between the cluster controller and each logical module in the material handler (transport and cassette modules), and between the material handler and each process module. 3. One independent process module integrating to a cluster tool control system: Interfaces are required between the cluster tool control system and the process module supporting the process module to cluster controller communications, and the process module to transport module communications. For fundamental compliance, each exposed interface shall support the fundamental requirements of each of the service groups required by the entities communicating. The required service groups for each interface are detailed in Section 8.6, and the required services for each service group are detailed in Sections 8.1 to 8.6.\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts\n\nContent: The Cluster Tool architecture and requirements are modeled in order to extract only the entities necessary for robust automated control and monitoring communications within a cluster tool. Figure 3 illustrates the major module domains and the primary relationships between them. Module resources and material domains are represented differently to others because they embody the physical entities acting and being acted upon respectively. The domains illustrated are as follows: Material — The material, or carrier of material, which is being received and processed in the cluster tool. Material Processing — Specifies the required application of processing to material as defined by the assigned recipe, adding value to the material. Material Movement — Includes exchange of material with the factory and material movement within the cluster, to get the material to the correct processing resource at the right time. Module Resources — Perform and coordinate the processing and material movement activities. Recipe Management\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts\n\nContent: — Provides the services to transfer recipes to be loaded as required for material processing, and manages recipe change control. Exception Handling Provides for interactive handling of exception conditions, including reporting and error recovery. Event Reporting Enables flexible event-based reporting of variable data as required by service-users. Object Services — Provide services to obtain and modify standard object attribute data. Each partition is presented in a subsection below with detailed information models. The concepts are presented in this section using two types of formal models: OMT object information models describing entities and relationships, and Harel state models describing the behavioral characteristics of the cluster tool. The graphical representations of these models are described in Conventions, Section 5. The events and actions which result from objects dynamically interacting form the basis for the communication requirements embodied in the standards. It is this mapping that specifies\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts\n\nContent: the communication services messages to be used. The major requirement of the cluster tool control system is that it provide robust supervisory control with minimal overhead. Within a cluster tool there is a significant amount of parallel processing. In addition to concurrent processing in multiple independent process modules, each material processing requires the use of recipe management (to get the correct recipe with the correct material) and the use of material movement (to get the correct material to the correct processing resource at the right time). The cluster controller maintains the overall mission of the system. Sub-missions are defined for, and responsibility given to, particular available module resources for execution. Once this responsibility is given, that module resource is fully in control, including direct communication with resources of other modules as required to attain the objective. 7.1 Object Information Models — T he cluster tool objects relevant to distributed control in a number of\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts\n\nContent: models, each emphasizing a particular aspect of the system as partitioned (see Figure 4). In addition to OMT conventions (see Section 5.2), each object in the information models has one of three designations: service objects with standardized attributes (thick border); other objects described in the sub-section (medium border); and objects described in other subsections but included to show significant relationships (thin border). The models are process- and configuration-independent and do not dictate the internal architecture of the controlled modules beyond the physical requirements of cluster tools. The first two models show major entities of the processing equipment and material being processed. Subsequent models are oriented towards one of the major functional domains. 7.1.1 Cluster Tool Module Model — The fundamental component of a cluster tool is the module. Figure 5 shows that there are three module types within a cluster tool: process module (PM)— provides manufacturing value to material transport\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts\n\nContent: module (TM) — transfers material within cluster cassette module (CM) — exchanges material with factory A cluster tool must contain one or more of each of these module types, as each performs a critical function in the cluster tool mission. Any module can contain processing resources. Supervisory control within the cluster tool is the responsibility of the cluster controller. The cluster controller achieves this by supervising the various module resources using the standard communications services. It is the primary service-user in the cluster tool. The form of the cluster controller is not specified in this standard. It may be a single platform, distributed, or incorporated with one or more modules. A module contains and coordinates a number of module resources dedicated to fulfilling a particular control function. Each module resource contains at least one material location, which may or may not contain material. Note that the location for material processing is defined separately from the location where the\n\nSEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E37.2-95 (Reapproved 0303) HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES GENERAL SESSION (HSMS-GS) - # 7  Concepts\n\nContent: material is received or sent. This may be virtual if they are physically the same position, but they cannot be assumed to be so as this would exclude certain architectures. The purpose of each type of module is described in detail below. Cassette Module — The component of a cluster used to interface the cluster to the rest of the factory. It provides material input and output for the cluster. It makes only one material at a time available to the cluster transport (the intratool environment), regardless of how the material enters the cassette module from outside the cluster (the intertool environment). It is a specialization of attached module (AM). Process Module — A process module is any component within a cluster which provides one or more steps of material processing for the cluster system. Material enters the process module through an interface flange, undergoes some transformation, and exits through the same or another interface flange. It is also a specialization of attached module (AM). Transport Module",
