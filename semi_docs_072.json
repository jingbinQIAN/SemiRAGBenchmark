A1-1 InP is a promising material for photonic devices such as LDs, LEDs, and photodetectors for fiber communications. The consumption of InP wafers is increasing year by year due to the fiber communication systems such as LAN, ISDN, and others. A1-2 In order to fabricate these devices, many rectangular wafers with more than 30 different sizes are industrially used but most of the sizes are not reasonably determined. From the viewpoint of material yield as explained below, the standardization of rectangular InP wafers is useful not only for InP wafer manufacturers, but also for device manufacturers. A1-3 Figure A1-1 shows the effective area (A) as a function of ratio of longitudinal length (a) and of lateral length (b). It is a fact that the largest area can be obtained when the shape is square. However, it is difficult to"

It is, therefore, necessary to make the shape rectangular in a way that one can distinguish the orientations. It is however, noted that if the length ratio becomes too large, the effective area is dramatically decreased as seen in Figure A1-1. For instance, rectangular wafers at the point $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ have very little area, and most of wafer is cut off in vain. It is, therefore, very reasonable to select the length ratio at which the effective area is not largely decreased. When the length ratio $\\mathbf { \\hat { a } } / \\mathbf { b }$ ratio) is $\\surd 2$ , the area decrease is only $5 . 7 \\%$ as seen in Table A1-1 and Figure A1-1. It is also interesting to note that if the length ratio is determined as $\\surd 2$ , each half of the rectangular wafer again gives a similar shape with the same ratio. In fact, this length ratio is used for paper standardization as A3/A4 or B3/B4. Rectangular wafers are therefore determined"

A1-4 Since there are already standardized $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and $7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ round wafers, the standardization is made in a way that large rectangular wafers can be obtained from these standardized wafers by removing $5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the periphery as seen in Figure A1-2. Removing of $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ is due to EPD measurement specifications in which $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ periphery is excluded from the measurement. A1-5 As explained above, it is highly recommended to use the standardized rectangular wafers because this standardization is very important in preventing proliferation of various sizes of rectangular wafers in the future.

    "content": "5.1  Test slices are prepared that ar e polished or lapped and etched on both sides to a thickness from 3 to $6 \\mathrm { m m }$ .  \n5.2  Apparatus should be calibrated by using the primary standard samples or secondary standard samples. This calibration coefficient is used to calculate the carbon concentration of specimens.  \n5.3  For room temperature measure ment, a baseline is drawn in the differential spectrum (after subtraction of the reference sample spectrum) from which an absorption coefficient is derived. The range of baseline should be wider than $\\pm 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m ^ { - 1 } }$ . The baseline has to be determined in an interval of the spectra which is neither influenced by main peak at $5 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { { \\dot { c } m } ^ { - 1 } }$ nor the side peak at $5 7 6 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ .

As such the concentration is critical in determining the substrate resistivity.  \n6.2  As a dominant acceptor in SI-G aAs substrates, carbon could, potentially impact ion implantation activation."

    "content": "7.1  Stray light that reaches the det ector will tend to reduce the calculated absorption coefficient value and thereby reduce the reported carbon concentration.  \n7.2  FT-IR instrument instruction m anuals should be consulted if problems with the technique are suspected.  \n7.3  The carbon absorption band ha lf width at room temperature must be less than $2 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for acceptable measurement results. Excessive width can be due to improper thickness matching or stress.  \n7.4  Specimens that do not exceed the instrument beam size will cause error. Use of apertures, or preferably beam condensers, can correct this problem.  \n7.5  The minimum detection level of this method is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the recording."

Here a required feature is an area on the surface of the FOSB specified by a dimension (or intersections of dimensions) that has a tolerance and not just a maximum or minimum (such as the edges of the robotic handling flange). 5.4 Door — It is recommended that the FOSB not be vertical when it is opened or closed. When the FOSB is in a vertical orientation with the door removed, the wafers must be restrained from touching each other by appropriate wafer support design or other retaining techniques. 5.4.1 Manual Door — If chosen, the manual door option requires no automation to open the door. An exclusion zone surrounding the manual door area is specified in the standard. There are several possible techniques for sealing and clamping the manual door that meet user requirements. Therefore, only an exclusion zone"

It should be noted that wafer position of FOSB is different from that of FOUP when the door is closed due to the wafer retaining structure. 5.4.2.2 Rear of Door (y51) — For manual door, FOSB has a $y 5 1 \\ge 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ to hold wafers in large area at front wafer retainer for keeping wafer quality during transportation.

The automated door and the carrier frame must have surfaces that mate with the seal zones defined in SEMI E62.

The automated door must also be designed so that when the box is pressed against the FIMS port, both latch keys on the port are inserted to their full length. Furthermore, when the latch keys are turned more than $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ toward the position that unlocks the automated door from the box, the latch key holes on the door must be such that the door is not removable from the latch keys.

It should be noted that wafers are typically shipped in a vertical orientation and generally require support from a secondary package. It is recommended that this secondary package be designed to allow for easy removal of the FOSB from the secondary package. 5.7 Wafer Orientation and Numbering — The wafers must be horizontal when the FOSB is placed on the coupling, and the wafers slots are numbered in increasing order from bottom to top (so the bottom wafer is wafer number 1, the next wafer up is wafer number 2, etc.). 5.8 Internal Horizontal Dimensions — Figure 2 shows a cross-section of the horizontal boundaries of the FOSB side domains (which contain the parts of the FOSB higher than $z 6$ above the horizontal datum plane and lower than $z 1 5$ above the top wafer).

The top of this cylindrical section is $z 1 1$ above the nominal wafer seating plane and its bottom is $z 1 0$ above the nominal wafer seating plane. The implications for wafer positioning of the tolerance on $r 2$ are as follows. The wafers should be placed in the FOSB within a circle of radius corresponding to the smaller bound on $r 2$ to avoid touching the edge of the wafer to the side of the FOSB. Once the wafer has been placed, the FOSB must not allow a wafer to move outside of a circle of radius corresponding to the larger bound on $r 2$ . There are two exceptions to this limit on wafer movement. When the wafer is pushed toward the rear of the FOSB, the location of the wafer is defined by the wafer pick-up volume (see $\\ P [ 5 . 9 . 3 )$ . When the FOSB is gently tilted forward up to $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ , the wafers may slide forward, but it is recommended that they"

Figure 7 Lower Cross-Section at Facial Datum Plane 5.9.3 Wafer Pick-Up Volume — If a wafer is placed in the wafer set-down volume and is then pushed toward the rear of the FOSB, then the entire bottom of the wafer must be contained in the wafer pick-up volume. However, if the wafer is not pushed toward the rear of the FOSB, then the wafer may only be somewhere within the wafer extraction volume. The wafer pick-up volume is defined by a cylindrical section with radius $r 1$ and a main axis at the nominal wafer centerline.

This may be needed to prevent the FOSB from being knocked off the kinematic couplings by the action of pushing the FOSB against the front-opening interface. The front retaining feature contains a ramp that a wheel might roll up while the FOSB is being pushed toward the front-opening interface. The arm with the wheel (not specified here) then holds the FOSB down on the kinematic couplings. The center retaining feature consists of an oblong slot with a chamber above it.
