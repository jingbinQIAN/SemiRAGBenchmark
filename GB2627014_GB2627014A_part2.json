The power dissipation value may be based on an input power value and an efficiency value of the boost converter at the determined input power value. Controlling the input current limit may comprise comparing the power dissipation value to a threshold power dissipation value and either reducing or maintaining the input current limit at an existing level accordingly. A change in a junction temperature of a semiconductor die on which the boost converter circuitry is implemented may be determined and compared to a threshold temperature change value, with the input current limit reduced or maintained accordingly. The boost converter circuitry may be implemented as a packaged integrated circuit and may be used in a portable device such as a computer, gaming device, mobile phone or VR device. Figure 2\n\nField of the Invention\n\nThe present disclosure relates to a system and method for controlling an input current limit of boost converter circuitry. In a packaged integrated circuit (IC) device, circuitry is implemented on a semiconductor (e.g. silicon) die encased in a protective package. The package is provided with external connectors such as conductive pins, pads or balls which are internally coupled to the semiconductor die to permit connection of the semiconductor die to external components. In operation, power is dissipated by the circuitry, which causes a junction temperature of the semiconductor die to increase. The degree to which the junction temperature increases is dependent upon the junction to ambient thermal resistance Theta JA (8ya) of the package. The junction to ambient thermal resistance 9, is defined as the temperature differential between a junction of an IC and the ambient temperature per Watt of power dissipated. 25 According to a first aspect, the invention provides a method for controlling an input current limit of boost converter circuitry, the method comprising: receiving a power dissipation value for the boost converter circuitry; and controlling an input current limit of the boost converter circuitry based on the power dissipation value.

As shown in Figure 1, the packaged IC 100 includes a protective package 110 that house a semiconductor die 120 on which boost converter circuitry 130 is implemented. The package 110 includes a plurality of external connectors 140 (e.g. conductive pins, pads or balls) which are internally coupled to the semiconductor die 120 to permit connection of the semiconductor die 120 to external components. As the boost converter circuitry 130 cannot operate with 100% efficiency, in operation of the boost converter circuitry 130, power is dissipated as heat, causing the temperature of the semiconductor die 120 to increase. The power Pdiss dissipated as heat into the semiconductor is the difference between the power Pin supplied to the IC 100 and the power Pout output by the IC 100, i.e. Pdiss = Pin — Pout. Thus, assuming that the power efficiency of the boost converter circuitry 130 remains constant, the temperature of the semiconductor die 120 will increase as the input power Pin and/or output power Pout increases. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the boost converter circuitry 130 is the dominant source of power dissipated as heat into the semiconductor die 120, but other elements of the IC 100 will also dissipate some power as heat, particularly if the IC 100 includes other circuitry in addition to the boost converter circuitry 130. Thus, the value Pdiss is representative of the total power dissipated as heat into the semiconductor die 120, i.e. the power dissipation of the whole IC, rather than just the boost converter circuitry 130. For clarity and brevity, the power dissipation value Pdiss is referred to herein as being indicative of the power dissipation of the boost converter circuitry, but it is to be appreciated that references to the power dissipation of the boost converter circuitry should be interpreted as references to the power dissipation of the whole IC. The boost converter circuitry 130 may be designed with a plurality of different specification ranges, each intended for a different use case. For example, the boost converter circuitry 130 may have an input voltage range of 3 to 12VDC, an output voltage range of 5 to 15VDC and a maximum input current limit of 2A, so that the input power Pin can be approximately 6W when the input voltage is 3V. In voltage regulated boost converter circuitry, the boost converter circuitry 130 is operative to maintain the output voltage at a predefined level, and so the boost converter circuitry will attempt to draw the input power (current) required to satisfy an output power (current) demand. Because of the inherent inefficiency of the boost converter circuitry 130 (i.e. because the output power Pout cannot be equal to the input power Pin because the boost converter circuitry 130 cannot operate at 100% efficiency), in order to support a given output power demand, the input power to the boost converter circuitry 130 must be greater than the output power demand. For example, if the boost converter circuitry 130 is operating in a configuration or mode in which it converts an input voltage of 5VDC to an output voltage of 10VDC, then if a current demand of a load coupled to an output of the boost converter circuitry is 400mA, the required output power Pout is 10V x 400mA = 4W. If the boost converter circuitry 130 were able to operate with 100% efficiency, the input current required to support this output power Pout at the 5V input voltage would be 800mA (because 5Vx 800mA = 4W). However, as the boost converter circuitry 130 cannot operate with 100% efficiency, the input power Pin must be greater than the required output power Pout, and so the boost converter circuitry 130 will draw more than 800mA of input current. Thus, assuming that the input voltage to the boost converter circuitry 130, the output voltage supplied by the boost converter circuitry 130 to the load, and the efficiency of the boost converter circuitry 130 are substantially constant, in operation of the boost converter circuitry 130 the input current Is determined by load conditions (which affect the load current demand). The boost converter circuitry 130 may be designed to provide a predefined maximum output power, However, if there are no limitations on the input current it is possible that in some circumstances the output power of the boost converter circuitry 130 may exceed the predefined maximum output power. For example, if the boost converter is operating in a configuration or mode in which it converts an input voltage of 10VDC to an output voltage of 15VDC with a fixed input current limit of 2A, then if the load draws a current of more than 667mA, the maximum output power of 10W is exceeded (because the output voltage of 15V x the load current of 667mA = 10W). This corresponds to an input current of around 1A, which is well below the 2A input current limit. As demonstrated by the above example, in certain circumstances (which may not have been foreseen when deciding on the specifications for the boost converter circuitry 130), it is possible that the boost converter circuitry 130 may be made to operate outside of its intended or specified operational parameters. This may lead to excessively increased die junction temperature and/or electrical overstress conditions and associated damage and/or other problems. The present disclosure proposes method and system for controlling an input current limit of boost converter circuitry 130 of the kind described above with reference to Figure 1 to reduce the risk of damage or other problems that may arise as a result of excessive increases or rates of increase in die junction temperature. Figure 2 is a schematic representation of a system for controlling an input current limit of boost converter circuitry according to the present disclosure. As shown generally at 200 in Figure 2, the system 200 comprises a controller 210 configured to provide a signal llim indicative of an input current limit to boost converter circuitry 230 which supplies an output voltage Vout and an output current lout to a load 240. The boost converter circuitry 230 may be implemented as a packaged IC of the kind described above with refence to Figure 1, and thus may comprise a semiconductor die on which the boost converter circuitry 230 is implemented, encased in a protective package. The controller 210 may be implemented in circuitry (e.g. integrated circuitry implemented on one or more integrated circuits, or discrete circuitry), or may alternatively be implemented in processing hardware such as a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a microprocessor or microcontroller executing suitable instructions, software or program code. The controller 210 is configured to receive a signal linmon indicative of an input current lin to the boost converter circuitry 230. The signal linmon may be supplied, for example, by input current monitor circuitry (shown schematically at 250 in Figure 2), which may comprise, for example, for example, a current sense resistor of known resistance coupled in series between an output terminal of a power supply that supplies the input voltage Vin to the boost converter circuitry 230 and an power supply input terminal of the boost converter circuitry 230 and analog to digital converter (ADC) circuitry coupled across the current sense resistor such that a digital signal output by the ADC circuitry is representative of a voltage across the current sense resistor, which is in turn indicative of a current through the resistor and thus the input current to the boost converter circuitry 230. The controller 210 is further configured to receive a signal Vinmon indicative of an input voltage Vin to the boost converter circuitry 230. The signal Vinmon may be supplied, for example, by input voltage monitor circuitry 260 which may comprise, for example, ADC circuitry having an input coupled to the power supply input terminal of the boost converter circuitry 230 and an output coupled to an input of the controller 210, such that a digital ADC output signal representing the magnitude of the input voltage Vin is provided by the ADC circuitry to the controller 210 as the signal Vinmon indicative of the input voltage Vin. The controller 210 is further configured to receive a signal indicative of an efficiency value Eff for the boost converter circuitry 230. The efficiency value may be dynamically calculated or estimated (e.g. by processing circuitry external to the controller 210, or by the controller 210 itself) during operation of the boost converter circuitry 230, e.g. based on measured or otherwise determined input and output currents and voltages, or may alternatively be a fixed value indicative of an estimated efficiency of the boost converter circuitry 230. The controller 210 is further configured to receive predefined package characteristics or parameters (e.g. a package junction to ambient thermal resistance 94, of a package of the boost converter circuitry 230). In some examples these predefined package characteristics are stored in a memory 220, which in the illustrated example is external to the controller 210, but which could equally be internal to the controller 210 (e.g. the memory 220 could be on-chip memory of a DSP IC). 30 The controller 210 is configured to dynamically adjust an input current limit for the boost converter circuitry 230 based on the input voltage Vin, the input current lin, and the efficiency value Eff. Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 300 performed by the controller 210 to control the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 in the system 200 of Figure 2. In a first step 310 of the method 300, the controller 210 determines a power dissipation value Pdiss indicative of the on-chip power dissipation of the boost converter circuitry 230. In a subsequent step 320, the controller 210 controls the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 based on the determined power dissipation value Pdiss. Figure 4 is a flow diagram illustrating steps that may be performed by the controller 210 in one example approach to determining the power dissipation value Pdiss in the first step 310 of the method 300. In a step 312, the controller 210 determines an input power value Pin, based on the input voltage Vin and the input current lin, by multiplying the input voltage Vin by the input current lin. In a subsequent 314, the controller 210 determines the power dissipation value Pdiss for an on-chip power dissipation, based on the determined input power value Pin and the efficiency value Eff. In some examples, the controller 210 may determine the power dissipation value Pdiss based on the determined input power value Pin and the efficiency value Eff alone. In such examples, the controller 210 may first calculate an estimated output power value Pout as the product of the efficiency value Eff (expressed as a decimal value less than 1) and the determined input power value Pin, i.e. Pout = Pin x Eff. The controller 210 may then calculate the power dissipation value Pdiss by subtracting the estimated output power value Pout from the determined input power value Pin, i.e. Pdiss = Pin — Pout. In other examples, the controller 210 may be programmed or otherwise provided with a relationship between the determined input power Pin, the efficiency value Eff and a currently selected boost ratio for the boost converter circuitry 230. This relationship may be defined by a polynomial which allows the efficiency value Eff to be calculated based on the determined input power value Pin and the currently selected boost ratio. Alternatively, the controller 210 may be programmed or otherwise provided with a lookup table populated with input power values, boost ratio values and the corresponding efficiency values. Table 1 below shows an example of such a lookup table. The controller 210 may select the appropriate efficiency value Eff for the determined input power value Pin and currently selected boost ratio from the lookup table. 10 Pin and currently selected boost ratio from the lookup table. Table 1 In a further alternative, the controller may receive the power dissipation value Pdiss (or a signal indicative of the power dissipation value Pdiss) from a system, apparatus or circuitry that measures the real-time power dissipation or efficiency of the boost converter circuitry 230 (e.g. the system described in the applicant's co-pending US provisional patent application no. 63/440,942, filed on 25 January 2023, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein). As described above, having determined or received the power dissipation value Pdiss, the controller 210 subsequently (at step 330) controls the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 based on the determined power dissipation value Pdiss. Figure 5 is a flow diagram illustrating steps that may be performed by the controller 210 in one example approach to controlling the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230. As shown generally at 500 in Figure 5, in a first step 510, the controller 210 compares the determined power dissipation value Pdiss with one or more threshold power dissipation values. If the determined power dissipation value exceeds a threshold power dissipation value, the controller 210 reduces the input current limit (step 520), to reduce the risk that the on-chip power dissipation could cause excessive heating of the semiconductor die on which the boost converter circuitry 230 is implemented. If the determined power dissipation value Pdiss subsequently falls below the threshold, the controller 210 may increase the input current limit. 15 If the determined power dissipation value is equal to or lower than the threshold power dissipation value, the controller may maintain the input current limit at its existing level (step 530). Figure 6 is a flow diagram illustrating steps that may be performed by the controller 210 in an alternative example approach to controlling the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 based on a change in a junction temperature of the semiconductor die. As shown generally at 600 in Figure 6, in a first step 610, the controller 210 may dynamically calculate a change ATj in a junction temperature of the semiconductor die, based on the determined power dissipation value Pdiss and the package junction to ambient thermal resistance value 9ja, by multiplying the determined power dissipation value Pdiss by the junction to ambient thermal resistance value 84a, i.e. ATj = Pdiss x Qua. Alternatively, the change AT] in junction temperature may be estimated, determined or predicted by the controller 210 using a Foster thermal model of the semiconductor die that is stored in or otherwise provided to the controller 210. The controller 210 may compare the calculated change ATj in junction temperature of the semiconductor die to a predefined threshold temperature change value (step 620) to detect if there is a risk that the junction temperature will exceed a safe limit. If the calculated change ATj in junction temperature exceeds the predefined threshold temperature change value (indicating a risk that the junction temperature will exceed the safe limit), the controller 210 may reduce the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 (step 630). If the calculated change ATj in junction temperature subsequently falls below the predefined threshold temperature change value, the controller 210 may increase the input current limit. If the calculated change ATj in junction temperature is equal to or lower than the predefined threshold temperature change value (indicating no risk or a low risk that the junction temperature will exceed the safe limit), the controller 210 may maintain the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 at its current level (step 640). Additionally or alternatively, if an initial junction temperature TjO is known (e.g. from an on-chip sensor measurement), a final junction temperature resulting from the on-chip power dissipation can be estimated, determined or predicted by the controller 210 by adding the change in junction temperature ATj to the initial junction temperature TjO, i.e. Tjfinal = TjO + ATj. Alternatively, the final junction temperature may be estimated, determined or predicted by the controller 210 using a Foster thermal model of the semiconductor die that is stored in or otherwise provided to the controller 210. Figure 7 is a flow diagram illustrating steps that may be performed by the controller 210 in an alternative example approach to controlling the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 based on an estimated, determined or predicted final junction temperature of the semiconductor die. As shown generally at 700 in Figure 7, in a first step 710, the controller 210 may estimate, determine or predict a final junction temperature value resulting from the on-chip power dissipation, as described above. The controller 210 may subsequently compare the estimated, predicted or determined final junction temperature value to a predefined threshold junction temperature value (step 720) to detect if there is a risk that the junction temperature will exceed a safe limit. If the estimated, predicted or determined final junction temperature exceeds the predefined threshold junction temperature value (indicating a risk that the junction temperature will exceed the safe limit), the controller 210 may reduce the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 (step 730). If the estimated, predicted or determined final junction temperature subsequently falls below the predefined threshold junction temperature value, the controller 210 may increase the input current limit. If the estimated, predicted or determined final junction temperature is less than the predefined threshold junction temperature value (indicating no risk, or a low risk that the junction temperature will exceed the safe limit), the controller 210 may maintain the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 at its current level (step 740). In some examples, the controller 210 may be operative to adjust the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 to permit the boost converter circuitry 230 to dissipate different levels of power for different durations, in order to maintain on-chip power dissipation within safe limits, e.g. below a level that could lead to damage or other problems due to excessive junction temperature, junction temperature increase or rate of junction temperature increase. Figure 8 is a graphical representation of a function defining a duration for which the boost converter circuitry 230 is permitted to dissipate power at different levels. Such a function may be implemented by the controller 210 to permit the boost converter circuitry 230 to supply sufficient power to support fast transient high output voltages (such as may arise, for example, in Class D audio amplifier circuitry) while still providing a safety mechanism against possible damage caused by excessive die temperatures or die temperature increases arising due to increased power dissipation as the output power supplied by the boost converter circuitry increases. According to the function illustrated in Figure 8, for boost converter circuitry 230 designed or configured to be able to dissipate a power of 5W indefinitely, the boost converter circuitry 230 may be permitted to dissipate a power of 7.5W for only 100ms, to dissipate a power of 10W for only 10ms, and to dissipate a power of 15W for only 1ms, in order to maintain the on-chip power dissipation and thus the die temperature, die temperature change and/or rate of die temperature change within safe limits. Figure 9 is a flow diagram illustrating steps that may be performed by the controller 210 in an example approach to controlling the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 based on a power dissipation vs duration function of the kind described above with reference to Figure 8. In a first step 910, the controller 210 receives a power dissipation value Pdiss. The output power dissipation value Pdiss may be determined as described above as the difference between an input power value Pin and an output power value Pout, for example. In a second step 920, the controller 210 compares the received power dissipation value Pdiss to a predefined power dissipation vs duration function to determine a duration (e.g. a maximum allowable duration) for which the boost converter circuitry 230 can dissipate power at the received power dissipation value Pdiss. Subsequently, at step 930, the controller 210 adjusts the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 after a time period equal to the duration determined in the second step 920, if necessary. For example, if the controller 210 implements the function described above with reference to Figure 8, if the power dissipation value Pdiss is than 5W, the controller 210 need not adjust the input current limit. However, if the power dissipation value Pout rises to 7.5W (e.g. due to an increase in input power caused by an increase in output power demand), the controller 210 will reduce the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 after a period of 100ms has elapsed, to reduce the risk of damage resulting from an excessive die temperature or die temperature increase arising because of the increased on-chip power dissipation. Similarly, if the power dissipation value Pdiss rises to 10W, the controller 210 will reduce the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 after a period of 10ms has elapsed, and if the power dissipation value Pdiss rises to 15W, the controller 210 will reduce the input current limit of the boost converter circuitry 230 after a period of 1ms has elapsed. In this way the boost converter circuitry 230 is permitted to supply sufficient output power to downstream circuitry (e.g. amplifier) to support transient increases in power (e.g. load current) demand, while reducing the risk of potentially damaging increases in die temperature.
