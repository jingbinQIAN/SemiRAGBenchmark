Reducing the energy used in any of these life cycles will improve the environmental impact of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment. NOTE 2: This guide focuses on only the use of the equipment life cycle stage. 6.2 Given the state of the industry with regard to energy conservation information and measurements, the use stage of the equipment life cycle appears to be the most effective stage to analyze for energy conservation opportunities. The energy used in the use stage is the best derived from the use rate of utilities and materials provided for the stage. 6.3 Various methods have been proposed for converting the use rate of specific utilities and materials into equivalent energy values. The energy used to produce any particular utility or material varies\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  General Concepts (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  General Concepts\n\nContent: from location to location and from time to time. While any single set of energy conversion factors cannot be valid world wide, some parties find value in the conversion exercise, particularly in identifying a utility or material that has a greater energy impact than others. 6.4 The equipment suppliers should investigate the utilities and materials use rate of the equipment and identify and implement design or process changes that lessen the energy impact of the equipment. The expense of implementing these changes can be balanced against the potential energy impact improvement when developing an energy conservation plan. NOTE 3: Changes in use rate can also affect the users cost of ownership for the equipment. This can also be considered in the cost-benefit analysis. 6.5 An equipment user can consider supplier-reported utilities and materials use rates, energy equivalent values, and planned improvements when making the purchasing decisions. 6.6 The use rate of utilities and\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  General Concepts (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 6  General Concepts\n\nContent: materials for a piece of equipment depends on the particular control parameters used to achieve the desired effect on a wafer (i.e. it depends on the process recipe) as well as the particular hardware used in the equipment and the conditions under which the measurements are taken. It is important to record this and other particular information when use rate measurements are conducted. 6.7 Based on the above considerations, the equipment supplier should set targets for energy, utilities and materials conservation, and consider continuous improvement plans for energy, utilities and materials usage on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. NOTE 4: The supplier may apply the concepts of this guide to the equipment model or models of their choice. 6.8 The characterization and quantification of energy, utilities and materials consumption should be based on a supplier baseline process.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 7  Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Energy Usage\n\n7.1  Analyzing energy use during various stages in the life cycle of semiconductor manufacturing equipment can yield valuable information for promoting energy conservation.  \n7.2  There are many ways the equipment life cycle can be conceptually divided into different stages.  \n7.3  This guide focuses only on the use (or use) stage of equipment life cycle.  \n7.4  Other life cycle stages may include  \nraw materials procurement, manufacturing,\npackaging,\ntransportation (shipment), decommissioning, and\ndisposal.  \n7.5  The use stage can be further divided into processing, idling, maintenance and service. This guide only addresses processing and idling.  \n7.6  Using the model methods of this guide, the equipment supplier may also analyze maintenance and service.  \nNOTE 5:  The SEAJ standard “SEAJ-E-003E ⎯ Guideline for conducting an LCA of Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipmen – Energy Saving Perspective ” may be referenced for an example of a more complete life cycle analysis.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8  Baseline Process(es) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8  Baseline Process(es)\n\nContent: 8.1 The measurement, conservation monitoring, improvement, and reporting methods should be based on one or several supplier baseline process(es). The equipment supplier is encouraged to consider baseline process(es) which also meet the needs of the users. 8.2 Considering the range of use a supplier intends for the equipment, several baseline processes may be used when utilities and materials use rate measurements are conducted. 8.3 The use rate and energy impact of any particular baseline process recipe can vary depending on the equipment optional hardware that is installed, whether the optional hardware is participating in the process or not (it may consume utilities and materials even when idle). Therefore, when baseline process(es) are designed, the particular hardware configuration can be a significant parameter and should be considered. NOTE 6: In the course of analysis, the supplier may discover that for two or more recipes which have the same desired effect, one\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8  Baseline Process(es) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 8  Baseline Process(es)\n\nContent: recipe is more energy efficient than another. NOTE 7: For users to make effective cost of ownership or energy impact comparisons between equipment, it is useful to have supplier data derived from the same baseline process (i.e. achieving the same desired effect on a substrate or other material). It is recommended that suppliers discuss this with the users and gather data that will facilitate effective comparisons.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 9  Utilities and Materials Use rate Measurement (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 9  Utilities and Materials Use rate Measurement\n\nContent: 9.1 A first step in determining the energy impact of a particular piece of equipment during any life cycle stage is to measure the use rate of utilities and materials in that stage. 9.2 Table 1 contains the recommended minimum set of utility and material parameters to measure while the equipment is performing its intended material processing function (according to a particular recipe) and while it is idling. NOTE 8: Related Information 1 contains additional use rate information that may be useful. NOTE 9: Many different chemicals may be used in the processing step. Process chemicals are not included in Table 1 because equivalent energy conversion factors are generally not available for them. The equipment supplier may, however, wish to measure and record their use rate anyway. 9.3 The units used in Table 1 are those used in SEMI E6, “Guide for Semiconductor Equipment Installation Documentation” which contains criteria for documenting all utility\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 9  Utilities and Materials Use rate Measurement (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 9  Utilities and Materials Use rate Measurement\n\nContent: requirements for every connection point on a piece of equipment. If the measurement equipment used to gather data does not report values in the indicated units, appropriate conversion factors should be used. 9.4 For the processing measurements, the average value of each parameter over the course of several processing cycles should be recorded as well as the length of the cycle. 9.5 For the idling measurements, the average value of each parameter over a period of idling should be recorded as well as the length of the period. NOTE 10: See Related Information 1 for additional recommendations.

Therefore, the output of the conversion calculation will not be correct for any particular location. However, if a reasonable set of conversion factors are used, the output of the conversion can be used to identify those utilities and materials which, generally speaking, have a higher environmental impact. NOTE 11: The use of a standard set of conversion factors also allows comparison of results from tests of various equipment. 10.3 It is recommended that equivalent energy be reported on a per year basis. 10.4 In Table 1, the use rate metrics have a per-hour basis. Therefore, the number of hours the equipment\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 10  Conversion Factors for Equivalent Energy (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 10  Conversion Factors for Equivalent Energy\n\nContent: spends processing and idling must be estimated to calculate per-year data. 10.5 Table 2 contains a recommended set of conversion factors. NOTE 12: Related Information 1 contains additional conversion factor information that may be useful. 10.6 The output units of all conversions are estimated kWh (kilowatt hours). This can be understood as the energy impact of the particular utility or material used. NOTE 13: See Related Information 1 for example calculations. 10.7 The equipment supplier may also use an alternate set of conversion factors. : If alternate conversion factors are used, it is recommended that the factors be documented in the report of the results. 10.8 A conversion factor is better if it accurately represents the actual electrical energy required to create and distribute a particular utility or material at the equipment’s end use location. 10.9 Determining reasonable energy conversion factors for most process chemicals has not yet entered\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 10  Conversion Factors for Equivalent Energy (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 10  Conversion Factors for Equivalent Energy\n\nContent: the state of the art.

The equipment supplier should also present a clear justification for each target. 11.2 The equipment supplier should discuss energy conservation improvement plans and utilities and materials use rate improvement plans with the users before implementing them so that the cost-benefit balance and its related assumptions can be more fully understood by all both parties. 11.3 Energy consumption reduction, and utilities and materials use rate reduction should be achieved through various means such as equipment design changes or recipe changes. 11.4 A more energy efficient method for the production of a particular utility or material can also significantly change the equipment’s\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 11  Target Setting and Improvement (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 11  Target Setting and Improvement\n\nContent: energy impact. The equipment supplier may wish to recommend to the users that utilities or materials be provided in a particular manner or from a particular source to achieve the best energy impact. 11.5 Equipment suppliers can also work with end users to understand the impact of their utility needs on the operating efficiency of end user utilities. Examples of these include decreasing the Room Heat Burden by means of increased cooling water heat transfer, decreased exhaust pressure drops, decreased cooling water heat exchanger pressure drops, etc. All of these changes, while not necessarily decreasing the utility use rate, may have a significant environmental impact. 11.6 There is a certain expense of time and materials for making a change to equipment. However, there may also be a benefit in reducing utility and material use rate. It is recommended that the cost/benefit balance be carefully analyzed before undertaking an equipment change. 11.7 The following\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 11  Target Setting and Improvement (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 11  Target Setting and Improvement\n\nContent: are a few ideas for reducing equipment energy consumption that may be feasible. There are certainly many more. Use the highest available voltage for the region of operation as the primary feed voltage (e.g., 300V Japan, 380V China, 480V USA and Taiwan, 240V or 400V Europe). Use warmer cooling water. Increase cooling water heat exchanger mean temperature difference. Decrease exhaust and cooling water pressure drops. Reduce bulk gas minimum supply pressures. Use less pure processing chemicals. Use clean dry air for pneumatic controls instead of nitrogen. Use control systems to activate exhaust only when needed. 11.8 The equipment suppliers should prepare an improvement roadmap which should focus on the use rate of one or several specific utilities or materials, or they should focus on the related equivalent energy impact, or both. 11.9 The following data should be considered to be included in an improvement roadmap. The type of equipment (model, options,\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 11  Target Setting and Improvement (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 11  Target Setting and Improvement\n\nContent: configuration). The utilities and materials that are targeted for improvement. The baseline recipe(s) that will be used to demonstrate progress. The use rate data that is measured at various times. The one or several sets of conversion factors used to estimate equivalent energy consumption. The target date by which the improvement (by specific utility/material or overall) will be achieved. Information describing why a target seems achievable and, generally speaking, how it will be achieved. A cost/benefit analysis on the equipment upgrade.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 12.1  Monitoring\n\n12.1.1  The equipment supplier should review the improvement status periodically and update the roadmap to monitor the conservation progress. A period of once every two years is recommended.  \n12.1.2  If the review indicates that targets have not (or will not) be achieved, it is useful to document the reasons as part of the roadmap data and to re-adjust the target dates and achievement strategy based on the most recent information.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 12.2  Reporting\n\n12.2.1  The equipment supplier should report to the users energy data, utilities and material use rate data and related improvement roadmaps for the equipment.  \n12.2.2  The reports should contain the roadmap data addressed in ¶11.9 at a minimum.  \n12.2.3  The equipment suppliers should also consider including data that the users would like to have included in the report.  \nNOTE 16:  The equipment supplier should be careful not to include in the reports any information that is identified as confidential to any party involved unless appropriate non-disclosure agreements are in place.

Because equipment control elements are different from equipment to equipment, the parameters of a recipe will also be different even if the desired effect on the substrate or other material is the same. R1-1.2 Within this guide, “baseline recipe” should be understood as the collection of recipe parameters intended to produce a specific desired effect. Therefore, the desired effect can be the same from equipment to equipment even though the parameters of the recipes may be different. R1-1.3 For processing measurements, the average value of each parameter over the course of the processing cycle should be noted. If the equipment processes substrates, a 10 substrate average should be recorded. If the equipment processes a material other than substrates (e.g. a vacuum\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-1  Other Use rate Measurements and Data (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-1  Other Use rate Measurements and Data\n\nContent: pump), the average over a 30 minute processing period should be recorded. R1-1.4 For idle measurements, the average value of each parameter over a period of 30 minutes should be recorded R1-1.5 A supplier may need to measure additional metrics for other purposes (e.g. to support other metricsgathering requirements and criteria relevant to supplier-user agreements). Adding those metrics to the energy conservation utility and material use rate measurement effort may be beneficial. R1-1.6 Semiconductor manufacturing equipment typically processes wafers or other substrates. It is useful to characterize utility and material use rate during processing in terms of per-wafer amounts needed to achieve the desired effect of the recipe. R1-1.7 By providing an equipment throughput metric (i.e., substrates per hour) with supporting throughput calculation information, the per hour processing metrics can be converted, approximately, into “per wafer” metrics.

R1-1.8 The data described in Table R1-1 should be recorded in addition to the use rate data of Table 1 in the main body of this guide. The goal is to record enough information to document the measurement event thoroughly so that it can be reproduced at a later time, perhaps, for example, to analyze the effect of equipment changes. R1-1.9 Some of the data (e.g. wafer size) in Table R1-1 may not be applicable to the equipment under consideration.

R1-2.1.1.1 While the conversion factors derived from this model will not be exactly correct for other facilities, they can at least be used as a starting point for identifying the relative differences in energy impact among the utilities and materials listed in Table 1 of the guide. R1-2.1.2 The conversion calculations of this guide can be used to express the estimated total equivalent energy that the equipment will consume in one year of use. The use rate measurements (units per hour) can be multiplied by the number of hours per year the equipment is estimated to be in the processing or idle state. This yields a total volume or mass of a utility or\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Equivalent Energy Conversion Factors (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2  Equivalent Energy Conversion Factors\n\nContent: material consumed per year which is then multiplied by the energy conversion factor. R1-2.1.3 Table R1-2 contains a calculation model and an example calculation. R1-2.1.4 The heat load calculation follows a model that is different than the other items. It is shown in Table R1-3.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.2  Estimated Hours per Year\n\nR1-2.2.1  It is recommended that the hours per year the equipment spends processing and idling be estimated as 6,132 and 2,190 respectively. This assumes 8,760 hours per year of opportunity. And, it assumes the equipment will be shut down (i.e. not consuming) for $5 \\%$ of the 8,760 hours. To provide reporting commonality within the semiconductor industry, it is strongly recommended that alternate values not be used.  \nNOTE 1:  The number of hours per year a piece of equipment spends processing or idling are not solely related to the equipment’s “availability” (described in SEMI E10). The number also depends on the processing demands of the end user, which may be less than the equipment’s availability.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.3  Conversion Factor Basis\n\nR1-2.3.1  A key basis for some conversion factors is the condition(s) under which the conversion factor was developed. For example, the conversion factor for water supplied at $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ might be different from the conversion factor for water supplied at room temperature because in addition to the energy used to distribute the water, energy is used to refrigerate the water.  \nR1-2.3.2  Table 2 of the guide includes some of the basis conditions for the recommended conversion factors. Where the actual conditions of the utility or material supply are different from these basis conditions, the conversion factor is less valid. There is no recommended method for adjusting the factor in response to these differences in all cases.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.4  Alternate Conversion Factors (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.4  Alternate Conversion Factors\n\nContent: R1-2.4.1 An equipment end user may have developed a set of conversion factors that they prefer for their business model. It is recommended that these also be considered. R1-2.4.2 An alternate set of conversion factors for different equipment use regions may be useful for analyzing the impact of differing utility and material production efficiencies in those regions. R1-2.4.3 A spreadsheet program can be used to show several different sets of conversion factors and the related conversion outcomes for a given set of utility and materials use rate data. R1-2.4.4 The development of meaningful conversion factors requires a certain amount of data gathering and analysis. It is recommended that if alternate conversion factors are used, the supporting data and analysis be prepared and made available to interested parties for review. R1-2.5 Process Chemical Conversion Factors R1-2.5.1 It is likely that any process chemical conversion factor (i.e. the energy consumed to\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.4  Alternate Conversion Factors (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.4  Alternate Conversion Factors\n\nContent: produce one cubic meter process chemical) is much greater than any other conversion factor listed in Table 3. R1-2.5.2 A very rough analysis based on data from other industries, indicates, for example, that simple chemicals such as K20 or ethanol have energy equivalents much greater than $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { k W h } / \\mathrm { m } 3$ .\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.6  Heat Load Calculation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.6  Heat Load Calculation\n\nContent: R1-2.6.1 The provided heat load calculation is based on the idea that all electrical energy supplied to the equipment becomes heat input which is transferred by one of three heat transfer modes. R1-2.6.2 If there are other sources of heat within the equipment, such as chemical reactions, that are significant, they should also be considered part of the heat input. R1-2.6.3 The heat energy is typically transferred by radiation and convection into the environment surrounding the equipment and remaining heat energy is transferred by convection to the process exhaust and conduction to the process cooling water. Theoretically all three heat transfer modes may be involved in for all heat transfer practices (tool to room, tool to exhaust, and tool to cooling water). R1-2.6.4 The heat removed by the air and water is determined through calculations involving particular constants (i.e. specific heat and specific gravity). R1-2.6.5 The heat load calculation is taken in four\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.6  Heat Load Calculation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.6  Heat Load Calculation\n\nContent: steps. First estimate the electrical energy delivered to the equipment per year. Next estimate the energy removed per year by exhausted air using the volume of air removed, the input-output air temperature difference, and the “Removal via Air” conversion factor. Then estimate the energy removed per year by cooling water in a similar manner, using the “Removal via Water” conversion factor. Finally subtract the last two energy values from the first to get the heat load of the equipment that is transferred to the room in which the equipment resides. R1-2.6.6 Once the room heat load of the equipment has been estimated, the “Heat Load Burden” conversion factor can be used to express the energy required to remove that heat from the equipment environment.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # R1-2.7  Electrical Energy\n\nR1-2.7.1  A conversion factor of 1 is presented for electrical energy. The value thus calculated is the electrical energy supplied to the equipment.  \nR1-2.7.2  The amount of energy required to generate the electricity is not addressed by this conversion factor of 1. This additional detail may be useful, but the applicable conversion factor will depend on the technologies used to generate and distribute the electricity that is used.  \nNOTE 2:  For example, the energy content of coal is approximately $8 0 0 0  { \\mathrm { \\ k W h } }$ per ton. If the electricity provider must burn one ton of coal to generate $6 0 0 0  { \\mathrm { \\ k W h } }$ of electrical energy, the electrical energy conversion factor could be set to 1.33 (no units) to express the actual energy required to produce $1 \\mathrm { k W h }$ of electrical energy.\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # Table R1-2  Energy Conversion Calculation Model and Example\n\nCalculation Model\nUse-rate Measurement Hours per Year Energy Estimated Energy\n(processing or idling) (processing or idling) Conversion $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ Consumed Factor per Year\nEstimated Hours per Year: Processing $= 6 1 3 2$ ; Idling $= 2 1 9 0$\nExample Calculation (processing)\nCooling Water $( 2 0 { - } 2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ ) for recipe “X”\nUse rate measured during processing: $0 . 5 0 0 \\mathrm { g a l / m i n } = 0 . 1 1 4 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { h r }$\nAnnual amount used for processing: $0 . 1 1 4 \\mathrm { { m } ^ { 3 } / h r \\times 6 , 1 3 2 \\mathrm { { h r } = 6 9 8 \\mathrm { { m } ^ { 3 } } } }$\nEstimated annual energy equivalent: $6 9 8 ~ \\mathrm { { m ^ { 3 } } ~ x ~ 1 . 7 8 ~ k W h / \\mathrm { { m ^ { 3 } } = 1 } } = 1 2 4 \\mathrm { { x } 1 0 ^ { 1 } ~ k W h }$\n\nSEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # Table R1-3  Heat Load Calculation Model and Example (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI S23-0705 GUIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, UTILITIES AND MATERIALS USED BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # Table R1-3  Heat Load Calculation Model and Example\n\nContent: NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any particular application.
