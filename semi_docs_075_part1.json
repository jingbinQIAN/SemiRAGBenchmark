It is a measure of the non-ideality of the barrier. 4.6 electrochemical — chemical reaction in which charge transfer takes place via an external circuit. 4.7 epitaxial layer — a layer of single crystal semiconductor material grown on a host substrate which\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 4  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: determines its orientation. 4.8 excess area — the difference between the wetted and illuminated areas. 4.9 flatband potential — the intercept on the voltage axis of the $\\bar { 1 / C } ^ { 2 }$ vs $\\mathrm { \\Delta V }$ plot. A measure of the built in field or barrier height. 4.10 illuminated area — the area of the sample which can be illuminated during electrochemical etching. 4.11 rectifying barrier — a potential gradient formed at the junction between two materials which permits the flow of charge in one direction only. 4.12 reference electrode — half cell which has a constant electrode potential, such as a saturated calomel electrode, SCE. 4.13 rest potential — the open circuit potential of the sample with respect to the reference electrode. 4.14 wetted area — the area of contact between the electrolyte and the sample.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 5  Summary of Method\n\n5.1  In this method, the carrier concentration of the epitaxial layer is measured by the CV method.  \n5.1.1  Ohmic contacts are formed on the sample.  \n5.1.2  A rectifying barrier, of known contact area, is formed by placing the sample in contact with an electrolyte.  \n5.1.3  The quality of the barrier is assessed using I-V and C-V measurements. 5.1.4  From the measured C-V data the carrier concentration of the layer is determined. 5.1.5  The sample is anodically etched to produce a new barrier deeper in the material. The etch depth is determined using Faraday’s law of electrolysis. 5.1.6  Sections 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 are repeated to generate a carrier concentration vs. depth profile.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6  Interferences\n\n6.1  Thin Layers — Diffusion of carriers into adjacent regions set a fundamental resolution limit to the measurement. In addition if the layer has a high sheet resistivity this can also affect the value obtained.  \n6.2  Double Layer Capacitance A limitation imposed by the physical nature of the electrolyte/semiconductor barrier which sets an upper limit to the measured carrier concentration, for accurate measurements, of $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 9 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ . The technique can be used beyond this value, but with progressive degradation.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.3  Etch Well Uniformity\n\n6.3.1  Etch Well Flatness — Non-uniformity increases the effective area and may result in the measurement not being wholly made in the layer of interest. The main causes of non-uniformity are gas bubbles, inadequate electrolyte circulation and uneven illumination.  \n6.3.2  Etch Well Roughness — indicates poor etching and has a deleterious effect on the measurements. Generally overcome by selecting a more appropriate electrolyte and/or etching conditions.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: 6.4.1 Series Resistance — From the contacts, sample and electrolyte affect the accuracy of the measurements. This effect is minimized by using a highly conductive electrolyte, making large area ohmic contacts and by employing a low measurement frequency. 6.4.2 Leakage Currents — Parallel conduction can affect the accuracy of the measurement. Its influence is reduced by employing a high measurement frequency. 6.4.3 Large Excess Area — Can give rise to errors on n-type material particularly when profiling Hi-Lo structures. The excess area is electrolyte dependent but is mainly affected by the quality of the seal used to define the area. Large excess areas indicate a poor seal and are corrected by replacing the seal. 6.5 Hi-Lo Structures — Measurement is subject to inaccuracy due to carrier diffusion and excess area errors. For accurate measurements, chemically etch to the layer of interest before measurement. 6.6 Contact Quality — Non-Ohmic or high resistance\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: contacts have a deleterious effect on the measurement. Contacts should be checked by measuring the resistance between two similar contacts and then reversing the current direction and repeating the measurement. 6.7 Surface and Deep States — Cause the measured capacitance to be frequency dependent and/or dependent on the rate at which the bias is changed. Usually resolved by using a high measurement frequency. This should not be confused with the frequency dependence which is more usually attributed to high series resistance. 6.8 Surface Films — Have a deleterious effect on the capacitance measurement. Film formation should be avoided by using an appropriate electrolyte, control of the etching bias and time and by electrolyte circulation. 6.9 Surface Roughness — The surface of the sample should be smooth and free of features that would affect the action of the seal. 6.10 Light — Light can affect the capacitance measurement, so the sample must be placed in a dark\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 6.4  Non-Ideal Electrical Characteristics\n\nContent: environment during the measurement. 6.11 Sample Loading — The accuracy of the measurement depends on the repeatability of the area. If a compliant seal is involved, such as a plastic ring, the sample should be held in contact with the seal by applying a controlled and constant force. No relative lateral movement should take place during the loading process. 6.12 Ring Variability — The condition of the ring has a large effect on the measurement. Good seals will have a small to zero excess area and exhibit a well defined and reproducible contact area.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 7  Apparatus\n\n7.1  Measurement of Etch Well and Ring Areas Measuring microscope with either an XY stage, with a linear resolution of $0 . 0 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ or better, or a camera and image processing system capable of measuring an area of $0 . 1 \\mathrm { \\dot { c } m } ^ { 2 }$ to better than $0 . 5 \\%$ .  \n7.2  Measurement of Etch Well Flatness — (Optional) A means such as a stylus profiler for checking the flatness and roughness of the etch well.

Read the Materials Safety Data Sheets before attempting to prepare the electrolytes. Use safety  \neyewear, rubber gloves and protective clothing. Prepare all electrolytes in a fume hood.  \n9.2  Ensure that all electrolytes are correctly labeled.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 10  Specimen Preparation\n\n10.1  The sample should be free from surface debris and scratches. The sample should be cleaned with deionized (DI) water and dried.  \n10.2  To measure a single layer or upper layer of a multilayered structure, no additional sample preparation is required.  \n10.3  For a buried layer in a multilayered structure, measurement accuracy is improved by removing the overlaying layers by either the use of selective or controlled chemical etches.  \n10.4  If the upper layers cannot be removed by chemical etching then the sample can be profiled electrochemically but in some cases this may reduce the accuracy of the method.  \n10.5  For conducting substrates Ohmic contacts should be made to either the front or back of the wafer. For insulating substrates an Ohmic contact should be made to the front of the epilayer. Contacts are formed electrically, by alloying or by any other suitable method. The quality of the contact should be verified electrically.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 11  Calibration and Standardization (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 11  Calibration and Standardization\n\nContent: 11.1 Sealing Ring — Calibration of the sealing ring areas is performed using a “blue slice”, made by growing an anodic oxide film on a polished n-type substrate. 11.1.1 The “blue slice” is profiled according to this test method. Etch only the minimum amount necessary to see the illuminated area (typically $0 . 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } )$ ). Flush the cell several times with DI water before removing the sample. Wash and measure the sample as soon as possible. 11.1.2 Wetted Area — The wetted area is observed due to chemical attack of the oxide film and is measured using a measuring microscope with cross hair eyepieces and micrometer XY stage or by using a zoom camera and image processing system. 11.1.3 Illuminated Area — Etches in the light and forms a well defined etch well, which is measured as per the wetted area. 11.1.4 Calibration Interval — Regularly check the area and condition of the sealing ring. For daily use, the ring areas should be calibrated at least\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 11  Calibration and Standardization (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 11  Calibration and Standardization\n\nContent: three times a week. 11.1.5 Replacement — Rings should be replaced if the excess area exceeds $10 \\%$ for rings of area $\\leq 0 . 0 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ or $5 \\%$ for rings of area $> 0 . 0 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ or if the perimeter is not uniform. 11.1.6 Alternative Calibration Method — The areas can be measured using known n and p-type test samples. This method is best suited for continual monitoring of the ring area between “blue slice” calibrations. 11.2 Instrumentation The bias voltage, measurement frequency and capacitance measurement should be checked annually. 11.2.1 Bias — The bias voltage should be checked with a DVM with an input impedance $> 1$ MOhm. 11.2.2 Capacitance — The capacitance measurement should be checked using calibrated fixed value capacitors covering the expected sample capacitance range or from $1 { - } 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n F }$ . 11.2.3 Frequency The measurement frequency should be checked with a frequency counter.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure\n\nContent: 12.1 Choice of Electrolyte — An electrolyte should be selected that forms a rectifying barrier with the sample, gives a flat, mirror finish etch well and generates only a small excess area. 12.2 Sample Mounting — A region of the sample should be defined which will form the rectifying contact with the electrolyte. This area can be defined by some form of sealing ring or mask, but it is important that the area of contact between the electrolyte and the sample be precisely known and remain constant during the measurement. 12.2.1 Sealing Ring — If the sample is pressed against a sealing ring, the seal must be cleaned with DI water and dried before positioning the sample. If the sample needs repositioning, the sample and sealing ring should be recleaned and dried. 12.2.2 Ring Loading — As the mounting pressure may effect the reproducibility of the measurement and the lifetime of the sealing ring, it must be controlled (e.g. by the reproducible use of a suitable compression spring).\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure\n\nContent: 12.3 Cell Filling and Debubbling — Fill the cell, which holds the sealing ring and other measurement electrodes, with the electrolyte. The process of filling the cell frequently traps bubbles of air on the surface of the sample. These bubbles must be removed before a measurement can be made. 12.4 Contact Evaluation — Verify that the contacts, for both directions of current flow have low and approximately equal resistance. 12.5 Rest Potential — Measure the sample’s rest potential to verify that the reference electrode and sample are electrochemically stable. Its value usually lies between 0 and $- 1 \\mathrm { \\Delta V }$ (respective to a SCE reference electrode). Values outside this range can indicate a problem with the sample or reference electrode. 12.6 Cable Compensation — Determine any stray capacitance or additional resistance associated with the cell and test leads that would impact the measurement. 12.7 Current vs. Voltage (I-V) — Used to select the bias for measurement\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure\n\nContent: and etching and as a general test of material quality. 12.7.1 Measurement Bias — is set in the reverse bias, low dark current region. 12.7.2 Etching Bias (p-type material) — is set in the forward bias region. The abruptness of the forward bias breakdown is indicative of the ohmic nature of the contacts. No or shallow forward breakdown often indicates unsuitable ohmic contacts. 12.7.3 Etching Bias (n-type material) — is set in the reverse bias, low dark current region. Illumination should result in a significant increase in current (photocurrent). 12.8 Capacitance vs. Voltage (C-V) — Used to evaluate the quality of the electrochemical diode and to select a range of possible measurement voltages. The measured flatband potential (respective to a SCE reference electrode) should lie between $- 0 . 5$ and $- 2 . 5 \\mathrm { V }$ for n-type semiconductors and between $^ { - 1 }$ and $+ 1 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ for p-type semiconductors. 12.8.1 Measurement Bias — is set in a region of low\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure\n\nContent: dissipation, where the $1 / \\mathrm { C } ^ { 2 }$ vs $\\mathrm { \\Delta V }$ plot is linear. For layers grown with concentration gradients, the latter condition cannot be strictly adhered to and in such cases the amplitude of the test signal, used for capacitance measurement, should be kept as small as possible. 12.8.2 Dissipation — The normally accepted safe level is $< 0 . 4$ . 12.8.3 Excess Area Capacitance — For n-type surface layers the capacitance of the electrolyte/semiconductor interface is measured prior to etching and the capacitance associated with the excess area is computed by multiplying the measured capacitance by the ratio of the excess area to the wetted area. 12.9 Carrier Concentration Profiling — Profile the sample using the etching and measurement conditions determined from the I-V and C-V data. 12.9.1 Carrier Concentration The carrier concentration is determined from the C-V data. 12.9.2 Excess Area Correction — For n-type material the capacitance\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 12  Measurement Procedure\n\nContent: associated with material in the excess area should be subtracted from the measured capacitance. 12.9.3 Etching — The sample is anodically etched at the etching bias. The depth of the etch well is determined from the time integral of the current using Faraday’s law of electrolysis. 12.9.4 Profiled Depth — The profile assumes that the measured carrier concentration lies at a depth equal to the sum of the etch and the depletion depths. 12.10 Ring Area — It is advised to measure the etch well area after profiling and to use this value to recalculate the carrier concentration vs. depth profile.\n\nSEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 13.1  Carrier Concentration, N (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M46-1101E TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING CARRIER CONCENTRATIONS IN EPITAXIAL LAYER STRUCTURES BY ECV PROFILING - # 13.1  Carrier Concentration, N\n\nContent: The principle of this method is based on measuring the slope of $1 \\mathrm { / C } ^ { 2 }$ vs $\\mathrm { v }$ . $$ N = \\frac { - 2 } { q \\varepsilon _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 0 } \\varepsilon _ { \\scriptscriptstyle r } A ^ { 2 } } . \\left[ \\frac { d \\big ( 1 / C ^ { 2 } \\big ) } { d V } \\right] ^ { - 1 } $$ where C is the measured capacitance (for n-type material the capacitance associated with the excess area should be subtracted from the measured capacitance), $\\mathrm { v }$ is the applied bias, $\\mathsf { q }$ is the electronic charge, $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { r } }$ is the relative permittivity of the sample, $\\scriptstyle { \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { o } } }$ is the permittivity of free space $( = 8 . 8 5 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } \\mathrm { F m } ^ { - 1 } )$ .

Both techniques use reflected light to allow deduction of the thickness and refractive index of thin layers. In both cases, layer thickness and index of refraction data must be “backed out” of the measured optical data by a process of successive approximation. Silicon islands in the BOX layer of SIMOX and interface non-uniformity make these techniques less reliable. 8.1.1.1 Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) Measurement — In this measurement, white light from a xenon arc lamp passes through a polarizing rotating filter and illuminates the sample site under study; reflected light passes through an analyzer to a monochrometer and photomultiplier detector. For each wavelength, reflectivity\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8  Test Methods (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8  Test Methods\n\nContent: oscillates with polarizer rotation; the magnitude and phase of reflectivity changes are measured to determine ellipsometric angles, δ and $\\Psi$ . The two measured spectra are fit by successive approximation to allow determination of the surface silicon layer and BOX layer thickness and oxide composition. For SE, the choice of instrument and associated model and fitting parameters affect the confidence-of-fit, so they should be taken into account in the user-supplier agreement. 8.1.1.2 Spectroscopic Reflectometry Measurement — In this measurement, light from a xenon arc lamp passes through a grating monochrometer or optical band-pass filters and illuminates the sample site under study; reflected light is gathered by a detector. Specular reflectivity is plotted as a function of wavelength from $0 . 4 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ to $1 . 1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . The analysis proceeds by making successively better approximations to index of refraction and absorption of each layer until an acceptable fit is\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8  Test Methods (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8  Test Methods\n\nContent: achieved. Measurements are made with a reflectance mode optical interferometer. 8.1.1.3 Optical Model Fitting and Correlation There are slight, systematic differences between layer thickness measured by SE and spectroscopic reflectometry. Because of this, users and suppliers should specify the actual measurement method to be used. The two methods offer results which are reproducible and well-correlated with each other over a wide range of conditions. If both measurement techniques are used, it is recommended that the reflectance system measurements should be calibrated to fit the results of the SE. 8.1.2 Measurement Positions The measurement strategy is to make a detailed measurement with an accurate fit on at least nine wafer sites, for example, the wafer center, four points at half of the wafer radius and four points at $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the wafer edge. The number and position of wafer sites to be monitored should be agreed on between users and suppliers. Generally, the greater the variability\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8  Test Methods (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8  Test Methods\n\nContent: relative to the mean, the larger the number of sites that should be monitored. In each case, the measurement system supplies a “goodness-offit\" parameter that indicates a level of confidence in the fit to the measured data. 8.1.3 Surface Silicon Layer and Buried Oxide (BOX) Layer Thickness — Spectra for each site are fit independently with both the surface silicon and BOX layer thickness as adjustable parameters.

The HF etches the buried oxide and creates cavities under the etch pits. The number of etch pits is counted through optical microscope. The etch pits include various defects such as threading dislocations and stacking fault pyramid. 8.3.1.4 Example 2 — SOI etch pit evaluation in bonded SOI wafers fabricated by delamination followed by CMP: SOI etch pit density increases when remaining SOI thickness after Secco etching is thinner and thinner.

Thus, damages deeper than $5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ or defects larger than $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ can be detected. These pits come from defects contained in original silicon material and/or damages or defects induced in SOI fabrication process. The former includes COP, bulk micro defects, oxygen precipitates, and so on. The latter includes CMP damages, defects induced by heat cycles and so on, as possibility. To define origins of SOI etch pits, their distribution in depth of SOI layers and/or that on a wafer should be evaluated. For example, CMP damages may be localized on surface of SOI layers. By etching SOI surfaces up to desired depth with using non-selective etching such as KOH followed by Secco etching, etch pits due to CMP damages disappear.

In addition, mechanical damage related defect is not introduced, since the SOI surface is smoothed out by hydrogen annealing instead of polishing. The major defect in this type of SOI wafers is same sided pyramidal stacking fault, that is induced at the initial stage of the epitaxy, and is grown through the epitaxy with upside-down pyramidal shape , and then is turned upside-down again by bonding. This defect is decorated as the etch pit by standard or diluted Secco’s etching as described in Example 1 in conjunction with HF dipping. It is enough to etch until $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ of the SOI layer remaining to etch the defect portion through the SOI\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8.3.1.2  Following are examples of the evaluation on SIMOX wafers and bonded wafers.

The following HF dipping etches the BOX through the etch pit to form large cavity. It helps to count low density of defects in a wide observation area with low magnification microscope.\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8.3.2  Threading Dislocation\n\n8.3.2.1  The etching of the SIMOX sample shown above in Section 8.3.1.3 (Example 1) is terminated when the remaining surface silicon layer thickness is 1/3–1/2 of the initial thickness and then dipped in HF as the same manner as Example 1.  In this case the etch pits include mainly threading dislocations only which can be counted through optical microscope.\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8.3.3  HF Defect\n\n8.3.3.1  Measurement of the microscopic etch pit density following an HF etch is commonly used to disclose defects in SOI material. Pitting of surface  \nsilicon may be present before the HF etch or be caused by HF etching. For this destructive measurement, a whole wafer or at least one quarter of a wafer should be used. The sample is placed in concentrated $( 4 9 \\% )$ HF for 10 to 15 minutes or diluted (e.g. $2 5 \\%$ ) HF for longer time (e.g. 3 to 4 hours), then removed, rinsed and dried. If there are pits or voids and/or metal particles or silicides formed in the surface silicon layer, the HF etches the metals/silicides and then etch the buried oxide. This results in local etching of BOX with 25−50 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ diameter (depending on the HF concentration and the etch time) centered on the original defects. The defect density is then measured in an optical microscope using a $5 \\times$ objective and $1 0 \\times$ eyepiece or comparable setup. The samples should be scanned for whole surface within edge exclusion boundary.\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8.3.4  Void\n\n8.3.4.1  Voids are determined as an unbonded area on bonded SOI wafers. See SEMI M41. Because SOI layer in thin bonded SOI wafers are typically $0 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick or thinner, void areas are broken and SOI layers as well as BOX are usually absent. By this reason, voids are specified as local absence of SOI layers and/or BOX in bonded wafers in this specification.  \n8.3.4.2  Visual inspection — Under visible light, the edge of voids is detected because the edge area is stepshaped due to absence of SOI layers and/or BOX layers. See Section 8.8 for inspection conditions.  \n8.3.4.3  Detection as large LLS — The edge of local absence of SOI layer and/or BOX scatters light. Therefore, voids are detected as large LLS. See Section 8.7.2 for the principle. A size of LLS corresponding to various sizes of voids should be calibrated or correlated by comparison of defects one by one using a microscope.\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8.4  Surface Roughness\n\n8.4.1  AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) — By contacting the probe equipped with the cantilever onto the wafer surface of the sample, and by scanning the cantilever and detecting the variation by optical method, the roughness information is obtained. A tapping mode is commonly used.\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # 8.5  Metal Contamination\n\n8.5.1  The surface metal contamination can be measured by TXRF, AAS and ICP-MS methods.  \n8.5.2  TXRF (Total X-Ray Fluorescence) — Total X-ray Fluorescence uses a low angle incident, and a tightly collimated X-ray beam excites the characteristic X-rays from impurity atoms near the sample surface. Usually, the angle of X-ray incidence is less than 0.1 degree. The element identification and the amount of the element can be obtained by measuring energy and intensities of fluorescence X-ray. The instrument provides a map of impurity element distribution. Surface roughness may change metal detection sensitivity. Thus, calibration is suggested before samples with deferent level of roughness, e.g. back surface, are measured.

The flameless method, superior to the flame method in the sensitivity, is now broadly used.  \n8.5.3.2  Sample Preparation Careful sample preparation is necessary for the precise measurement. SOI wafer surface is exposed to HF vapor, and metals on the surface are collected as droplet.  To improve sensitivity, the volume of collective solution should be as small as possible and HF drops are rolled all over the surface in collective operation. In case of precious metals, it is better to use other kinds of collective solutions instead, since they are not dissolved or collected by HF solution itself.\n\nSEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # Examples: (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M47-0704 SPECIFICATION FOR SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) WAFERS FOR CMOS LSI APPLICATIONS - # Examples:\n\nContent: 1.

Usually, sample solution is vaporized in the nebulizer and then finally introduced into Argon plasma in the silica tube called torch through the spray chamber.

The scattered light and the noise from the wafer surface is detected as a direct current, on the other hand, the scattered light by the particles can be detected as pulse components. The particle size can be calibrated with standard polystyrene latex spheres. SOI wafers usually have scattering noise from the layer interface. It is necessary to reduce incident angle of the laser beam to increase the reflective component from the surface. For example, S/N ratio is improved when using S-polarized light of 10 degree incident, $8 5 \\%$ of its component is reflected from silicon surface.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on August 27, 2001.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2001; to be published November 2001.\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for evaluation of chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) processes of thin films on unpatterned silicon substrates.  This includes recommended procedures for process testing and reporting formats.  \n1.2  This guide is intended for use by both suppliers and end users.\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This document provides a guide for evaluating a CMP process for films deposited or grown on an unpatterned silicon substrate.  These evaluations could include tests with fixed polishing time, fixed removal rate, fixed ending thickness, time-dependent material removal, and others.  \n2.2  Recommended procedures for characterizing a CMP process are discussed in this guide. 2.3  This guide suggests selected parameters and values of the properties of the starting monitor wafer.  \n2.4  This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  The guide does not address evaluation of CMP processes for films on patterned substrates.  \n3.2  Evaluation of surface quality or surface contamination is not addressed in this document. Surface quality and surface contamination are important aspects of the CMP process evaluation but they are beyond the scope of this guide.  \n3.3  This guide employs sample standard deviation to estimate variation.  \n3.4  Wafer positioning precision on a metrology tool can affect the precision of the polishing evaluation. This issue is not addressed in this standard.  \n3.5  The values derived from the calculations in this guide are sample-dependent.  They are affected by measurement location and number of observations.\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E89 — Guide for Measurement System Capability Analysis\nSEMI M1 Specifications For Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers\nSEMI M11 — Specifications For Silicon Epitaxial Wafers For Integrated Circuit (IC) Applications\nSEMI M20 — Specification for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate System.\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 4.2  ASTM Standards1\n\nF 534 — Test Method for Bow of Silicon Slices  \nF 1390 — Standard Test Method for Measuring Warp on Silicon Wafers by Automated Noncontact Scanning  \nF 1530 — Test Method for Measuring Flatness, Thickness and Thickness Variation on Silicon Wafers by Automated Noncontact Scanning  \nF 1618 — Standard Practice for Determination of Uniformity of Thin Films on Silicon Wafers.\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 4.3  DIN Standards2\n\nDIN 50441/4 — Prüfung von Materialen für die Halbleitertechnologie; Messung der geometrischen Dimensionen von Halbleiterscheiben; Scheibendurchmesser und Flattiefe.

The diameter scan is useful in determining the thickness profile of the material on the wafer surface. 5.3 edge scan — measurements of material taken along a specified radial segment in the edge region of the wafer. A series of edge scans can be employed to determine circumferential thickness profile. 5.3.1 Discussion — the data density for edge scan measurements is generally higher than for other measurements. Combining a low-density diameter scan in the central region of the wafer with a higherdensity edge scan, taken along the same scan line, can improve throughput with appropriate local measurement data density. 5.4 film total thickness variation (film TTV) — the total thickness variation $( \\mathrm { T h k } _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } } - \\mathrm { T h k } _ { \\operatorname* { m i n } } )$ of film\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: material among a set of measurement points. 5.4.1 Discussion — The variation may pertain to a region within a wafer, a complete wafer or multiple wafers with a single polish head, or multiple wafers with multiple polish heads. These wafer and head combinations must be considered in planning and comparing measurements. If one assumes that a given wafer is polished by a subset of the tool heads (typically one), a hierarchical relationship exists such that wafers must be associated with the (tool head) subsets used to polish them. Another way to look at this is, if head is considered an experimental treatment, then a wafer polished by one head will be assumed to be treated differently than a wafer polished by a different head. This relationship leads to what is known as a hierarchic or nested model. (In this case, one says that wafer is nested within head). A more complete model would also treat head as a fixed effect, wafer random and nested within head, and error as nested with head\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: and wafer. A random effect indicates that the observation comes from a random sample of a larger population. Head is a fixed effect because the entire population of heads (i.e., all the heads on the tools) constitutes the entire population of interest. Given this model, variance components would be used to estimate the different sources of variation. In this case, the sample standard deviation underestimates the population standard deviation. Historically, the expected value of the variance components is equal to the population standard deviation. This is not the case for the sample standard deviation. 5.5 head to head removal rate non-uniformity (HTHNU) — this metric is useful when evaluating polishing processes on a multi-head tool configuration. It is the standard deviation $( 1 \\sigma )$ of the removal rate variation from polish head (HTH) to polish head for a fixed number of wafers where the number of wafers run for each head must be equal. It is expressed as follows: $$\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: \\mathrm { \\Delta H T H N U } = \\mathrm { \\sqrt { \\frac { \\displaystyle \\sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { p } \\left( \\overline { { R R _ { \\mathrm { ~ k ~ } } } } - \\overline { { R R _ { \\mathrm { \\scriptsize ~ H T H } } } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } { \\displaystyle p - 1 } } } $$ Where $k$ is the head indexer and $p$ is the total number of heads. $\\overline { { R R _ { k } } }$ is the average within wafer removal rate of head k. $\\overline { { R R _ { H T H } } }$ is the head to head wafer removal rate averaged across all wafers and all heads.

A typical number for $\\mathbf { m }$ is $\\geq$ 25. The measurement site locations on each wafer must be identical for all wafers sampled. The wafer-to-wafer removal non-uniformity is expressed as follows: $$ \\mathrm { W T W N U \\ } = \\ \\sqrt { \\frac { \\displaystyle \\sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { m } \\left( \\overline { { \\mathrm { R R } _ { _\n\nSEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI M48-1101 GUIDE FOR EVALUATING CHEMICAL-MECHANICAL POLISHING PROCESSES OF FILMS ON UNPATTERNED SILICON SUBSTRATES - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: \\mathrm { \\scriptsize { w l w } } } } } - \\overline { { \\mathrm { R R } _ { _ \\mathrm { \\scriptsize { w r w } } } } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } { m - 1 } } $$ It may also be expressed as a percentage of the average wafer to wafer removal rate: 5.11 within wafer average removal rate — the average removal rate within a wafer.

It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  This test method is limited to use on unpatterned wafers.  \n3.2  This test method is limited to use on calibrated scanners operated in a production mode.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E89 Guide for Measurement System Capability Analysis  \nSEMI M52 — Guide for Specifying Scanning Surface Inspection Systems for Silicon Wafers for the $1 3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ Technology Generation  \nSEMI M53 — Practice for Calibrating Scanning Surface Inspection Systems Using Certified Depositions of Monodisperse Polystyrene Latex Sphere on Unpatterned Semiconductor Wafer Surfaces\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 4.2  ISO Standard1\n\nISO Guide 30:1992 — Terms and Definitions Used in Connection with Reference Materials  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: 5.1.1 capture rate (CR) — the probability that an SSIS detects an LLS of latex sphere equivalent (LSE) signal value at some specified SSIS operational setting. 5.1.2 certified reference material (CRM) — reference material, accompanied by a certificate, one or more of whose property values are certified by a procedure which establishes its traceability to an accurate realization of the unit in which the property values are expressed, and for which each certified value is accompanied by an uncertainty at a stated level of confidence. [ISO Guide 30:1992] 5.1.3 cumulative false count rate (CFCR) — number of false counts of size $S _ { f } ,$ or larger, that are expected to be recorded by an SSIS at some specified operational setting as a function of $S _ { f } .$ CFCR may be found by averaging false counts over multiple scans. 5.1.4 false count (FC) — laser-light scattering event that arises from instrumental causes rather than from any feature on or near the\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: wafer surface; also called false positive. 5.1.4.1 Discussion — False counts would not be expected to occur at the same point on the wafer surface during multiple inspection scans, and hence they could be considered as random “noise” that could be identified by examining the results of repeated scans. 5.1.5 false count rate (FCR) — mean total number of false counts per wafer that an SSIS reports at some specified SSIS operational setting. 5.1.6 repeat counts — LLSs that are found in a later scan within the scanner $X Y$ uncertainty distance of their location as found on an earlier scan. 5.1.6.1 Discussion — The implication is that if defect density is low enough, then a repeat count results from detecting the same LLS event again and is not the result of SSIS noise. Besides the absolute position of the LLS, an additional matching condition may be the LSE signal of the LLS. 5.1.7 scanner XY uncertainty — square root of the sum of the squares of the one-sigma\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: standard deviations in the reported $X$ and $Y$ locations of the SSIS under test, as determined under repeatability conditions. 5.1.8 true count — laser-light scattering event that arises from the localized light scatterers (LLS) being investigated.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 6  Summary of Method\n\n6.1  The $X Y$ coordinate uncertainty of the SSIS under test is either known or determined under repeatability conditions, without removing the wafer from the stage between scans.  \n6.2  The reference wafer to be used in this test is selected.  \n6.3  The selected wafer is scanned $Z$ times on the SSIS under test.  The first two scans are used to qualify the reference wafer before continuing with the remaining $Z { - } 2$ scans.  \nNOTE 2:  Typical values for $Z$ are between 30 and 100 scans.  \n6.4  The scans are analyzed to determine and record the number of times each LLS event occurs in each location (to within a distance approximately six times the scanner $X Y$ uncertainty) during the $Z$ scans.  The capture rate, standard size deviation, false count rate, and cumulative false count rate are determined from this data set.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 7  Apparatus\n\n7.1  SSIS under test — installed in its position of use with clean room rating recommended by the manufacturer.  \n7.2  Off-line analysis software program — to track each observed count and determine the capture rate, standard size deviation, the number of false counts at each LLS size, the false count rate, and the cumulative false count rate.  \nNOTE 3:  The analysis software may be incorporated into the SSIS, if desired.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 8  Test Specimens (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 8  Test Specimens\n\nContent: 8.1 Use any wafer with (1) natural LLS with density $< 1 0 \\mathrm { L L S } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ and (2) a surface roughness typical of the wafers to be measured in production (see Section 2.3). 8.1.1 The minimum distance between any two LLS found during any one scan and used in the data set to be analyzed shall be larger than six times the scanner $X Y$ uncertainty.

Define the total number of LLS events that repeat their position in the first scan to within six times the scanner $X Y$ uncertainty as $M _ { 2 }$ . Consider the wafer qualified for the test if the share of repeat LLS events on the wafer, $M _ { 2 }$ , is larger than 0.75 $M _ { 1 }$ . Make certain that the conditions of Sections 8.1 and 8.1.1 are fulfilled for both wafer scans. 9.2 Scan the wafer a total of $Z$ times to obtain\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 9  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 9  Procedure\n\nContent: CR, FCR, and CFCR data (see NOTES 3 and 6). Record each LLS event detected during the $Z$ scans according to its position $P$ and size $S$ . NOTE 5: The two scans obtained in Sections 9.1 through 9.1.2 can be used as part of this data set, but the wafer must remain on the scan stage during the entire set of $Z$ scans to perform the measurement sequence under repeatability conditions.\n\nSEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 10.1  Initial Analysis (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI M50-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING CAPTURE RATE AND FALSE COUNT RATE FOR SURFACE SCANNING INSPECTION SYSTEMS BY THE OVERLAY METHOD - # 10.1  Initial Analysis\n\nContent: 10.1.1 Determine the locations on the wafer where an LLS event has been detected at least once by comparing all recorded positions (within the constraint of the sixsigma $X Y$ uncertainty) of the multiple scans as reported by the SSIS. These locations, $L _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ , with $i = [ 1 , 2 , . . . , N ]$ represent the complete set of LLS events to be used in the analysis. Each location is characterized by the number of scans $H _ { i } ,$ in which the LLS event at that position has been detected, and by the $H _ { i }$ reported sizes $S _ { i h }$ , where $h = [ 1 , 2 , . . . , H _ { i } ]$ , for the LLS event. 10.1.2 Consider those of the $N$ events with $H _ { i } = 1$ , (i.e., events seen only once) as false counts. Order these events by decreasing size, $S _ { i }$ .
