The sample should be gas phase and analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector. NOTE 7: It is good practice to keep carrier gas flowing through the instrument. This prevents the back-diffusion of moisture and carbon dioxide in the air from contaminating the column. NOTE 8: When not analyzing samples, the dual column switching valve should be set at the molecular sieve position to prevent the silica gel column from drying out. NOTE 9: The silica gel column will, after repeated use, tend to dry out. This will\n\nSEMI C3.12-1102SPECIFICATION FOR AMMONIA $( \\mathsf { N H } _ { 3 } )$ IN CYLINDERS, 99.998%QUALITY - # 4.1.5.9  Repeat Section 4.1.5.8.

Overall sensitivity will drop as the peak areas decrease due to the peaks spreading out more and more. NOTE 10: The condition of the silica gel column is restored by allowing the carrier gas to pass through the water-saturated silica gel trap that has been provided. (Normally the carrier gas bypasses this trap.)
