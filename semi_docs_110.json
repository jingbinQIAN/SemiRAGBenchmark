This long baseline was drawn between the average transmittances in the regions from 900 to $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and from 1200 to $1 3 0 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ . The same baseline was used in ASTM Test Method $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } 1 2 1$ , the predecessor to Test Method F 1188, and also in the analysis of infrared data from the Grand Round Robin (GRR) experiment.1 The GRR experiment resulted in a calibration factor between the infrared absorption coefficient at $1 1 0 7 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and the absolute interstitial oxygen content known as “IOC-88.” This calibration factor is utilized in the current editions of all known standardized test methods for oxygen content of silicon, including DIN 50438, Part 1; and JEITA EM-3504; as well as the current Chinese National Standard (GB).

However, the long baseline is subject to uncertainties due to perturbations in the IR absorption at the end-point regions arising from effects other than absorption by interstitial oxygen. Use of a shorter baseline, drawn between 1040 and $1 1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ , which is less affected in this manner,2 results in improved precision of the method. Use of the shorter baseline is introduced into this test method to replace the long baseline method. Although the use of this baseline results in a somewhat smaller net absorption coefficient for the same oxygen content, this change is not very large, and can be neglected in most cases. Optionally, to completely eliminate the effect of the baseline changes, the measurement equipment may be calibrated with suitable certified reference materials (CRMs) or reference materials derived from CRMs. NIST $\\mathrm { S R M } ^ { 3 } ~ 2 5 5 1$ oxygen-in-silicon"

Both the GRR specimens and the SRM specimens were measured using a short baseline similar to that now incorporated in this test method. This resulted in (1) reduced measurement uncertainty for the SRM specimens, and (2) a strong metrological foundation provided by the GRR specimens. Consequently, the IOC-88 results are available to the users of the SRMs without requiring a change in the calibration factor even though the short-baseline method is used. Despite the fact that IOC-88 has been adopted by all of the major standards developing organizations active in the semiconductor field, many older calibration factors that have been used in earlier standards issued by ASTM and other standards development organizations are still in use in the industry today.

Oxygen is introduced into silicon wafers during the crystal growing process.  Hence, it is important to control the oxygen content of silicon crystals.  \n1.2  Measurement of the intensity of the $1 1 0 7 ~ \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ oxygen-in-silicon band with an infrared spectrophotometer enables the determination of the value of the absorption coefficient and, hence, by the use of a calibration factor or linear regression curve, the content of interstitial oxygen.  \n1.3  This test method can be used as a referee method for determining the interstitial oxygen content of silicon slices. Knowledge of the interstitial oxygen content of silicon wafers is necessary for materials acceptance and control of fabrication processes, as well as for research and development."

The contrast of the interference fringes depends upon the parallelism of the specimen surfaces, and the fringe spacing depends on the optical thickness of the specimen. These fringes can obscure a weak spectral line and prevent accurate measurement of the baseline. To prevent obscuration by these interference fringes, nonparallel specimen surfaces may be a necessity. However, the use of specimens with nonparallel surfaces can also result in photometric errors. Because silicon has a high refractive index, any nonparallelism of the specimen can displace the spectrometer beam relative to the active area of the detector. Thus, an apparent lowering of the transmission occurs. Improper positioning or nonparallelism of the specimen can be checked by rotating the specimen to determine whether the transmission level stays constant. Any variation is a possible indication of problems with the specimen positioning or preparation."

Compare these slices with one another, and choose the specimen with the lowest absorption as the oxygen-free reference specimen.  If no absorption is seen for any of the specimens, then the assumption can be made that all specimens contain less than the limit of detection of oxygen and any of the specimens can be used as the oxygen-free reference specimen.  \n11.1.2  Prepare the oxygen-free reference specimen to the same tolerances as the test specimen with a thickness of equal to that of the test specimen to within $\\pm 0 . 5 \\%$ .  \n11.2  Prepare separate oxygen-free reference specimens for each type of material to be tested."

The uncertainty in the absolute determinations of oxygen content in silicon during the Grand Round Robin results primarily from the uncertainty in the chemical analysis measurements and any variations in the oxygen content of the various slices used in the test. The first of these is estimated to be about $6 \\%$ , and the second is estimated to be much smaller. This uncertainty directly affects the assigned value of the IOC-88 calibration factor. Errors in this calibration factor cause errors in the value of the derived oxygen content. Therefore, the bias of these measurements from these sources is estimated not to exceed $6 \\%$ .

    "content": "Title: SEMI MF1239-0305 TEST METHOD FOR OXYGEN PRECIPITATION CHARACTERISTICS OF SILICON WAFERS BY MEASUREMENT OF INTERSTITIAL OXYGEN REDUCTION - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 Oxide precipitates in the bulk of a silicon wafer can act as gettering sites for contamination that may be introduced during manufacture of circuits and devices. This contamination (usually metallic impurities), if not gettered, can reduce device manufacturing yields and degrade device or circuit performance. Thus, the oxygen precipitation characteristics of the silicon wafer can significantly affect both yields and performance. 1.2 Although interstitial oxygen concentration is an important factor in affecting the amount of oxygen precipitation that occurs in silicon during a specific thermal cycle, the presence of other impurities such as carbon or nitrogen, and differences in dopant type and density, thermal history, or defect properties of the crystal can also affect the precipitation characteristics. Thus, it is frequently necessary to choose particular material properties and preparation techniques to obtain the desired precipitation characteristics for a"

    "content": "1.1  The presence of oxygen can be beneficial to certain manufacturing operations by preventing the formation of process-induced defects.  Oxygen is introduced into silicon wafers during the crystal growing process.  Hence, it is very important to control the oxygen content of silicon crystals.  \n1.2  SIMS can measure the oxygen concentration in heavily-doped silicon substrates used for epitaxial silicon where the free carrier concentration obscures the infrared absorption and prevents the normal use of the infrared measurement as a characterization technique for the commercial production of silicon.  \n1.3  The SIMS measurement allows for the production of controlled oxygen content in heavily-doped silico crystals.  \n1.4  This test method can be used for process control, research and development, and materials acceptance purposes."

Since the calculated concentrations are derived from the ratio of extrinsic features to the intrinsic feature, the ratio will be decreasing as the excitation intensity is increasing. Thus, if a sample is measured at a higher excitation level than the instrument is calibrated for, the calculated concentration will be artificially low, and vice versa. 3.2 Sample surface damage, bulk defects, or other lifetime reducers also affect the line-intensity ratios and overall luminescence intensity owing to their tendency to reduce the steady state population of"

Because carbon may also reside in interstitial lattice positions when in concentrations near the solid solubility limit, the results of this test method may not be a measure of the total carbon concentration at such concentrations. 2.2 The useful range of carbon concentration measurable by this test method is from the maximum amount of substitutional carbon soluble in silicon down to about 0.1 parts per million atomic (ppma), that is, 5 × 10 15 cm−3 for measurements at room temperature, and down to about 0.01 ppma, that is, 0.5 × 1015 cm −3 at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K). 2.3 This test method utilizes the relationship between carbon concentration and the absorption coefficient of the infrared absorption band associated with substitutional carbon in silicon.

The detection limit at cryogenic temperatures (below 80 K) is about 0.01 ppma. Obtaining reference samples much below 0.01 ppma in carbon content may prove to be difficult. Therefore the measurement of very low carbon content silicon near the 0.01 ppma detection limit is necessarily a comparative measurement only. 3.3 Spectrophotometer technique is critical to a successful carbon determination.
