Within the TOP_CELL Cell ID section (below) both Patterns and other Cells ! can be listed. The value for the Top Cell is given by the PLACEMENT_TOP_CELL keyword in the ! MASK_GROUP section above. ! ! This example lays out each component of the Mask using the \"CELL_INSTANCE\" keyword. ! Each Ultratech Field is represented by a \"FLD_x\" designation for a Cell Instance, where \"x\" is ! the field number. The general idea is to designate a cell for each Field separately and to let ! the MASK_PATTERNS cell hold the remaining data.
