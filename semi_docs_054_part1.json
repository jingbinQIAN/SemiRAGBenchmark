The BCDS conditioning process described above is one approach to preleaching impurities from the BCDS. Other variations include combinations of static and dynamic rinses and emphasis on the use of dilute HF as the aqueous preclean chemical that is particularly effective for iron removal, however, it contributes high levels of fluoride which may be a concern for some qualification processes. 9.2 Specialty Chemicals Certai n CVD chemicals have high levels of organics which raise concerns about chemical decomposition, residues and particulate formation. These concerns may require customized approaches to the design of a BCDS\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 9  Other Considerations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 9  Other Considerations\n\nContent: qualification. For example, reservoir replacement for these types of chemicals with vapor pressure from 1-5 Torr and above may require the use of vacuum less than the vapor pressure of the chemical whereas low vapor pressure chemicals with vapor pressures from 1-5 Torr, and viscous materials, may require a solvent purge. In addition, purging and pickling of he BCDS and chemical delivery lines should be performed per Sections 7.1 and 7.2.

The sag generator must be capable of producing independent output voltages on each phase of the load. The sag generator must have the performance characteristics in Table 2 (see Related Information 1). Table 2 Sag Generator Performance Requirements\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7  Safety Precautions\n\nNOTE 4: The following are safety guidelines for voltage sag testing and as such should be considered only recommendations since regional safety regulations vary.  International, national and local codes, regulations and laws should be consulted to ensure that the equipment and procedures meet regulatory requirements in each testing location.  \n7.1  Work should be conducted in a ccordance with industry standard safety procedures.  Since panels may need to be open in order to connect voltage probes and route power leads to and from the sag generator, this work is classified as Type 2 Energized Electrical Work per SEMI S2.  Test equipment manufacturer’s safety recommendations should be followed.\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.2 Worker Safety\n\n7.2.1  During testing lock and tag (lo ckout/tagout) procedures should be followed to control hazardous energy (reference appropriate regional regulations and requirements).  No circuit should be connected or wired when electricity is present.  This includes power connections as well as the connection of various monitoring probes.  \n7.2.2  The area immediately surround ing the device under test (DUT) should be cordoned off and appropriate signs like “Test In Progress” should be posted. 7.2.3  Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn at all times.\n7.2.4  Only authorized personnel sho uld be allowed within the cordoned off test area.\n7.2.5  Work should be done as described in the test procedure (see Section 10).  \n7.2.6  Proper connections should be traced and verified before energizing.\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 7.3  Equipment Safety\n\n7.3.1  The sag generator should have a fail-safe design. NOTE 5: Subjecting equipment to repeated voltage sags of less than $80 \\%$ nominal for longer than 3 seconds may damage equipment.  \n7.3.2  The sag generator should be pr otected by an appropriately sized branch circuit breaker at the utility power source.  This will protect the sag generator and DUT from short circuits and overcurrent conditions.  \n7.3.3  Every effort should be made to protect the DUT. As with other equipment tests damage to the DUT is possible. Although only a remote possibility, the equipment owner should be made aware of the potential for damage.\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 8  Sampling and Test Specim ens\n\n8.1  Characterization tests are cond ucted on samples of production articles, not on each item produced. Characterization tests apply to equipment that is manufactured to a single design either in multiple quantities or one-of-a-kind.  The equipment selected for testing should reflect current production models of the supplier.  \n8.2  The intent of this document is to make reasonable efforts to test the semiconductor process, metrology, and automated test equipment as a complete operating system under the actual intended conditions of end use. To simulate the worst-case condition, the tests described in this document should be performed during the most sensitive process mode of the equipment as determined by the equipment supplier.\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 9  Test Setup\n\n9.1  The test setup should consist o f a sag generator and a data acquisition system as shown in Figure 1.  \n9.2  When the current required by t he DUT is within the sag generator’s rating, the sag generator shall be connected between the incoming utility power source and the point of connection (POC) on the DUT.  If the current required by the DUT is greater than the rating of the sag generator, then individual subsystems of the DUT can be tested separately.  \n9.2.1  If DUT subsystem testing is re quired due to the limitation of the sag generator, each subsystem must be tested independently with the other parts of the DUT operating.  Tested in this manner, any interlocks or alarms that might activate during the test will be apparent.  Testing the DUT main power module may require providing power to only the main power module, leaving the subsystems turned off.  After the characteristics of the DUT main power module EMO circuit are known, testing of DUT subsystems can begin as described.\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 9.2.2  Power down the DUT.

Typical semiconductor equipment voltage sag shutdown mechanisms include EMO circuitry, instrument and controller power supplies, motion control drives, and voltage monitoring relays.  \n11.2  The shutdown or dropout of equipment components is best identified when monitored by a DAS that is tightly coupled to the control of the sag generator.  Figures 2 and 3 display the shutdown of a power supply during a $5 5 \\%$ of nominal 10-cycle (200/167 ms) voltage sag.  \n11.3  Figure 2 displays the actual vo ltage sag output from the sag generator and Figure 3 displays the output of the power supply.  With the DAS it can be seen that  \nthe power supply output begins to decay 3 cycles (60/50 ms) into the $5 5 \\%$ of nominal sag event, causing the DUT to interrupt.\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 12  Reporting Test Results (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # 12  Reporting Test Results\n\nContent: 12.1 Report the specific test plan us ed and, if used, the voltage sag ride-through specification. 12.2 Report the manufacturer, mod el number, revision (if known) and process application for the DUT. 12.3 Report the type of sag generato r and the accuracy of the test apparatus. 12.4 Report the outcome of the voltage sag testing in both a tabular form (see Tables 4 and 5) and plotted on a graph(s), voltage magnitude (Y axis) and duration (X axis).

All units except the contactor based transformer-switch type are capable of some point-on-wave controllability.  \nFigure R1-1 Transformer-Switch Type Sag Generator\n\nSEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Transformer-Switch Type (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F42-0600 TEST METHOD FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Transformer-Switch Type\n\nContent: R1-2.1 This type of sag generator has been built with either insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), silicon control rectifier (SCR), or contactors used as the switching devices. The IGBT based switch is the most controllable with the ability to precisely control the point on the waveform in which the voltage sag starts and finishes (0-360 degrees). With an SCR switch, the point on wave of the voltage sag starts can be controlled, but the cutoff point of the voltage sag will be fixed at zero degrees. In real power systems, the point-on-wave in which the voltage sag occurs is somewhat random and unpredictable. A contactor based unit simulates the randomness of a real power system in that the point-on-wave in which the voltage sag begins is not controllable, but is dependent on the lag time between energizing the coil of the contactor and contactor closure. Figure R1-1 below displays a three-phase sag generator test fixture with data acquisition.

The following curve (see Figure R1- 1) was developed to define voltage sag ride-through for use with semiconductor processing equipment. Primarily due to testing limitations, only the portion between 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds) and 1.0 seconds was selected for inclusion in the specification. As future test equipment, methods, and data are developed the specified duration limits may be expanded. Recommended voltage sag ridethrough capability limits from zero to 100 seconds are included here for reference (see Figure R1-1). While not currently included in this SEMI specification the wider range should be considered when designing equipment and selecting components. R1-1.2 Over voltage conditions also covered in the ITIC CBEMA-curve contained in IEEE 446, IEEE 1100, and\n\nSEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-1  Basis for this Industry-Specific Semiconductor Standard (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-1  Basis for this Industry-Specific Semiconductor Standard\n\nContent: SEMI E51, are not considered in the scope of this industry-specific specification primarily due to the extremely low number of semiconductor equipment interruptions caused by over voltage events. While not in the scope of this specification, over voltage conditions should not be ignored and use of existing equipment protection techniques should be continued (see SEMI E51 or IEEE 446 for generic equipment over voltage ride-through specifications).\n\nSEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical Standards\n\nContent: R1-2.1 This SEMI standard is intended to be coordinated with related SEMI, IEC and IEEE standards. The relationship of this SEMI specification to many other standards that address equipment immunity, test methods, and safety was considered in development of this specification. For example, the emerging IEC Generic Immunity standard for industrial environments currently published by CENELEC as EN 50082-2 recommends a generic equipment immunity limit for Europe. When published by IEC, this standard will provide a generic equipment voltage sag immunity limit. Another example is the US National Fire Protection Association on Industrial Machinery (NFPA 79), which sets a generic equipment voltage sag immunity limit for the United States. R1-2.2 These emerging generic limits were considered in the establishment of ride-through limits for semiconductor equipment. However, most generic equipment limits are less stringent than the existing CBEMA-curve currently referenced in SEMI E51.\n\nSEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical Standards (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical Standards\n\nContent: For most installations meeting the CBEMA limits (a specification which was developed for computer business equipment) still results in an unacceptable number of semiconductor equipment interrupts. Therefore, the requirements in this international standard were developed to better suit the semiconductor industry. While more stringent, this industry-specific specification is not in conflict with known generic equipment regulations from other regions or generic equipment standards from other organizations. R1-2.3 Another published IEC standard defines a generic immunity test method for voltage sags (dips), IEC 61000- 4-11. This standard does not provide limits but does provide a voltage sag test method for single-phase equipment rated less than 16 amps. It has been considered in defining voltage sag ride-through parameters and it may provide an interim voltage sag immunity test method. As noted in this document, a test method for three-phase equipment greater than 16 amps is\n\nSEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical Standards (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # R1-2  Relationship to Generic Electrical Standards\n\nContent: being developed for use with semiconductor equipment. R1-2.4 The generic type standards developed for industrial or consumer equipment by organizations like IEC, ITIC, and IEEE provide a foundation for industryspecific standards like those published by SEMI Standards. In acknowledgement of this tiered approach to standardization there are provisions for recognizing industry-specific or product-type standards by organizations like IEC. Typically, product-type standards when developed by industry-specific organizations take precedent over the broader based generic industrial standards.\n\nSEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # Duration of Voltage Sag in Seconds (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F47-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT VOLTAGE SAG IMMUNITY - # Duration of Voltage Sag in Seconds\n\nContent: Figure R1-1 Recommended Semiconductor Equipment Voltage Sag Ride-Through Capability Curve from 0 to 100 Seconds NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any particular application.

ICP–MS is the preferred method because it is more sensitive and efficient. Alternate procedures may be used if they meet the\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: same analytical performance criteria. Each laboratory is responsible for verifying the validity of each method within its own operation. 2.6 This method is applicable for t he elements found in Table 1: Table 1 List of Applicable Elements (See NOTE 1.) NOTE 1: See Limitations, Section 3.3. 2.7 This method may be used for o ther materials, or other nonvolatile elements, if the end-user wishes and performance is demonstrated for the analyte of interest, in the matrices of interest, at the concentration levels of interest. 2.8 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 The accuracy of the method is limited by the detection limits of the instruments and by the sample preparation procedure. 3.2 This procedure anticipates ana lysis levels in the ppm (mass/mass) range. Impurities less than 0.1 ppm may not be detected by this method. 3.3 When extending the method to other elements recovery should be evaluated during validation. Poor recovery rates are often found for volatile elements such as boron (B), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), mercury $( { \\mathrm { H g } } )$ , gold (Au), and tungsten (W) because of the relatively high temperature sample preparation method and poor stability of some elements in aqueous solution. Elements forming volatile halogenides can be affected due to the in-situ production of hydrogen halogenides when halogenated polymers are ashed. 3.4 This is a bulk analysis techniq ue. For leachable testing or surface analysis refer to the Related Documents (Section 16) of this method. 3.5 Due to the rapid advances in d igestion technology, consult the manufacturer’s\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: recommended instructions for guidance when conducting analyses using the DCV sections of this document. 3.6 DCV techniques can generate gaseous digestion reaction products, very reactive, or volatile materials at high pressures. Spontaneous venting which can occur during sample heating may cause venting of the vessels with potential loss of sample and analytes. Sample sizes greater than $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { g }$ may accentuate this event. 3.7 In the use of the DCV techniqu e, TiO2, alumina, and other oxides may not be totally dissolved. Sequestering of target analyte elements may occur. 3.8 Although this method allows t he sampling of small pieces of polymer that are mechnically removed from a larger item, obtaining such samples in a clean manner may be difficult. Multiple sampling, separation and preparation techniques might be necessary to establish confidence in the results. 3.9 This document is not intended to supersede international, national or local codes, regulations, and laws.

The sample is then analyzed by ICP–MS, GFAAS, and/or ICP–AES to determine the inorganic content of the material.  This method applies only to nonvolatile metals (i.e., alkali metals, alkaline earths, and transition metals).  \n6.2  Data from different tests can b e compared to determine the inorganic content in different materials and in the same material from different manufacturers.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 7  Significance and Use\n\n7.1 Determining the metallic conta mination concentration in bulk polymer materials used in either distribution systems for process fluids or products in direct contact with the wafer is important criterion for deciding the suitability of a material.

This test method does not purport to address the safety considerations associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before using this method. 10.1.2 Care must be taken in the hand ling and use of the acids to avoid acid burns or contamination of the acid. Acid should be neutralized before disposal. 10.1.3 Care must be taken when using the propane torch to avoid burns. The torch should not be used near flammable materials or solvents. 10.1.4 Care must be taken when using the muffle furnace to avoid burns. 10.1.5 When ashing fluoropolymeric materials, the ashing must be performed in a fume hood. When heated, fluoropolymer materials outgas hydrofluoric acid fumes and may also emit fluoropolymeric particles which, if inhaled, can cause a condition known as “polymer fume fever.” If hot fluoropolymer fumes\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.1  Safety Precautions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.1  Safety Precautions\n\nContent: are inhaled, remove the individual to a well-ventilated area and seek medical attention. 10.1.6 The outer layers of vessels use d in the DCV technique are frequently not as acid or reagent resistant as the liner material. To retain the performance and safety required these outer layers must be neither chemically degraded nor physically damaged. Routine examination of the vessel materials may be required to ensure their safe use. 10.1.7 Only DCV containers with pre ssure relief or control mechanisms or containers with suitably inert polymeric or quartz liners and pressure relief mechanisms are considered acceptable for use with this process. NOTE 4: Only microwave manufacturer’s approved vessels for that device should be used. 10.1.8 Use of laboratory microwave s ystems is required for this method. Users are advised not to use domestic (kitchen) type microwave ovens or cookware. Nor should inappropriately sealed containers without pressure relief for microwave acid digestions be used. See Section 16.3.1 for\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.1  Safety Precautions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.1  Safety Precautions\n\nContent: additional information on safety issues concerning the use of laboratory microwave systems. 10.1.9 Toxic nitrogen oxide(s), hydro gen fluoride, and toxic chlorine (from the addition of hydrochloric acid) fumes are usually produced during digestion. Therefore, all steps involving open or the opening of digestion vessels must be performed in a properly operating fume ventilation system. 10.1.10 The analyst should wear appro priate protective clothing, such as gloves and face protection, and must not at any time permit a solution containing hydrofluoric acid to come in contact with skin or lungs.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.2  Technical Precautions – Digestion by Dry Ashing (DDA) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.2  Technical Precautions – Digestion by Dry Ashing (DDA)\n\nContent: 10.2.1 Flaming and ashing temperatu res must be controlled so that they do not exceed $6 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ to minimize metal loss due to volatilization. If the crucible becomes excessively hot for longer than about one minute during flaming, it may have overheated. When testing the method for recovery rates, it will become apparent that the sample has been overheated from the low recovery of metals. 10.2.2 One method of cleaning the cr ucibles and covers is to flame them with a propane torch or other appropriate heating source until they are sufficiently hot, allow them to cool, rinse in dilute ultrapure nitric acid, and then rinse in ultrapure water. 10.2.3 When ashing a sample, take ca re that all of the ash residue remains in the crucible. 10.2.4 Several factors concerning sele ction of crucible materials should be considered when performing the DDA technique. For example, the crucible itself can contribute elevated levels of its own composition into samples at\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.2  Technical Precautions – Digestion by Dry Ashing (DDA) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.2  Technical Precautions – Digestion by Dry Ashing (DDA)\n\nContent: trace levels. Temperature restrictions are another factor to consider in the selection of the crucible material. Corrosion of the crucible during the decomposition of the sample should also be considered. For example, in the ashing of fluorinated materials, platinum is preferred over quartz glass that could be etched by the liberated hydrogen fluoride.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.3  Technical Precautions – Digestion in Closed Vessel (DCV)\n\n10.3.1  Trace analysis requires a thoro ugh cleaning. One method of cleaning the vessels is to leach with hot (1:1) hydrochloric acid (greater than $8 0 \\mathrm { C }$ , but less than boiling) for a minimum of two hours followed with hot (1:1) nitric acid (greater than $8 0 \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ , but less than boiling) for a minimum of two hours and rinsed with reagent water and dried in a clean environment.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 10.4  Other Technical Precautions\n\n10.4.1  When switching between high concentration samples and low concentration samples, all crucibles or digestion vessels should be cleaned according to the corresponding and recommended cleaning procedure. This cleaning procedure should also be used whenever the prior use of the digestion vessels is unknown or cross contamination from vessels is suspected.  \n10.4.2  Trace metallic levels of reagen t blanks must be significantly lower than those in the sample in order to obtain accurate results for the analyte of interest.  \n10.4.3  Perform sample preparation in a clean environment and under a fume hood to minimize contamination.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.1  Sampling of Test Specimens\n\n11.1.1  Test specimens shall be representative of the polymer material being tested and shall be free of embedded particles and extraneous surface contamination when visually inspected.  \n11.1.2  Two samples of each material shall be prepared per SEMI F40.  This test is performed in duplicate. More samples may be analyzed if desired.  \nNOTE 5:  The samples are cleaned and weighed according to SEMI F40.  The sample preparation described in this document begins with either the ashing (DDA) or digestion under pressure (DCV) of the polymer material.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.2  Sample Preparation – Digestio n by Dry Ashing (DDA) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.2  Sample Preparation – Digestio n by Dry Ashing (DDA)\n\nContent: NOTE 6: Digestion by ashing using an oxygen plasma asher differs considerably from the described procedures that refer to ashing in open crucibles. Specific instructions are available from the instrument manufacturers. 11.2.1 Clean the digestion container a nd cover using appropriate methods for the vessel materials and procedures being employed. 11.2.2 Place the sample into a cleaned crucible. For at least two additional samples, add the recovery spike as discussed in Section 12. 11.2.3 Use a propane torch or other appropriate heating source to carefully flame the outside of the crucible until the polymer inside the crucible is completely charred. Do not flame exceedingly, i.e., do not allow a platinum crucible, for example, to become red hot, as excessive heat will allow some metals to volatilize. NOTE 7: This step must be carried out in a well-ventilated fume hood. 11.2.4 Prepare at least three procedur al blanks by flaming three or more empty crucibles using the method\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.2  Sample Preparation – Digestio n by Dry Ashing (DDA) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.2  Sample Preparation – Digestio n by Dry Ashing (DDA)\n\nContent: discussed in Section 11.2.3. The results from these blanks will be used to determine the metallic contribution from the crucibles themselves, from the reagents and from the test procedure. These procedural blanks should be treated like any other sample. Crucibles should be rotated in and out of service so that the same crucibles are not always used for blanks. 11.2.5 Place the charred sample cruci bles and blank crucibles in a muffle furnace, cover the crucibles with the cleaned covers, and continue to char at 500 to $6 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ until all the carbon is removed (usually over a period of $6 { - } 1 8 ~ \\mathrm { h r s } ^ { \\cdot }$ ). The removal of all carbon is indicated by the absence of black material in the sample. NOTE 8: Some oxides (such as $\\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { . }$ ) are black and may confound this determination. If a sample is still black after 18 hours, assume that it is an oxide and continue with the procedure. 11.2.6 Allow the\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.2  Sample Preparation – Digestio n by Dry Ashing (DDA) (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.2  Sample Preparation – Digestio n by Dry Ashing (DDA)\n\nContent: crucibles to cool. 11.2.7 Add the appropriate amount $( 1 - 2 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m L } )$ of concentrated ultrapure hydrochloric acid to each crucible. 11.2.8 Evaporate the hydrochloric aci d to dryness in a chemical hood at less than $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ if necessary to permit instrumental compatibility. NOTE 9: The presence of chloride in the sample can result in interferences for the determination of arsenic and vanadium by ICP-MS. 11.2.9 Continue preparing the sample as described in Section 11.4.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3  Sample Preparation – Digestio n in Closed Vessel (DCV) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3  Sample Preparation – Digestio n in Closed Vessel (DCV)\n\nContent: 11.3.1 Clean the digestion container a nd cover using appropriate methods for the vessel materials and procedures being employed. 11.3.2 Place the sample into a cleaned digestion container. For at least two additional samples, add the recovery spike as discussed in Section 12. 11.3.3 Add the reagents needed for th e digestion. 11.3.4 Prepare at least three procedur al blanks by adding the same amount of all reagents, but no sample, to three or more additional containers. The results from these blanks will be used to determine the metallic contribution from the containers themselves, from the reagents and from the test procedure. These procedural blanks should be treated like any other sample. Containers should be rotated in and out of service so that the same containers are not always used for blanks. 11.3.5 The analyst should be aware o f the potential for a vigorous reaction. If a vigorous reaction occurs upon the initial addition of reagent or the sample is suspected of\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3  Sample Preparation – Digestio n in Closed Vessel (DCV) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3  Sample Preparation – Digestio n in Closed Vessel (DCV)\n\nContent: containing easily oxidizable materials, allow the sample to predigest in the uncapped digestion vessel. Heat may be added in this step for safety considerations (for example the rapid release of carbon dioxide from easily oxidized polymeric material). Once the initial reaction has ceased, the sample may continue through the digestion procedure.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3.6  Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturer’s directions. (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3.6  Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturer’s directions.\n\nContent: 11.3.7 Properly place the vessel in the digestion system according to the manufacturer’s recommended specifications and connect appropriate temperature and pressure sensors to vessels according to manufacturer’s specifications. 11.3.8 Set the parameters of the diges tion device to manufacturer’s recommendations. NOTE 10: If the pressure exceeds the pressure limits of the vessel, the pressure will be reduced by the relief mechanism of the vessel. NOTE 11: Pressure control for a specific matrix is applicable if instrument conditions are established using temperature control. Because each matrix will have a different reaction profile, performance using temperature control must be developed for every specific matrix type prior to use of the pressure control system. 11.3.9 At the end of the digestion pro gram, allow the vessels to cool for an appropriate period of time before removing them from the system. When the vessels have cooled to near room temperature, determine if\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3.6  Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturer’s directions. (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3.6  Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturer’s directions.\n\nContent: the microwave vessels have maintained a seal throughout the digestion. Due to the wide variability of vessel designs, a single procedure is not appropriate. The use of a spiked control sample is appropriate to ensure that analyte loss has not occurred due to vessel venting. For vessels with burst disks, a careful visual inspection of the disk may identify compromised sample digestions. 11.3.10 Complete the preparation of th e sample by carefully uncapping and venting each vessel in a fume hood. Vent the vessels using the procedure recommended by the vessel manufacturer. Transfer the sample to an appropriate acid cleaned container. 11.3.11 If the digested sample contains particulates, which may clog nebulizers or interfere with injection of the sample into the instrument, the sample may be centrifuged, allowed to settle, or filtered. 11.3.11.1 If necessary, centrifugation at 2,000–3,000 rpm for 10 minutes is usually sufficient to clear the supernatant. 11.3.11.2 Settling\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.3.6  Seal the vessel according to th e manufacturer’s directions.

Allowing a sample to stand overnight will usually accomplish this. 11.3.11.3 Filtering –– If necessary, the f iltering apparatus must be thoroughly cleaned and pre-rinsed with dilute (approximately $10 \\%$ V/V) nitric acid. Filter the sample through qualitative filter paper into a second acid-cleaned container. 11.3.12 Continue preparing the sample as described in Section 11.4.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 11.4  Preparation of the Sample for Analysis\n\n11.4.1  If the sample was obtained fro m the DDA method, add $0 . 5 { \\mathrm { ~ m L } }$ concentrated nitric acid to each crucible.  \n11.4.2  For samples obtained from the DCV method, transfer or decant the sample into volumetric ware.  \n11.4.3  Dilute either obtained sample to a required volume with ultrapure water (usually $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m L } )$ . Alternatively, a gravimetric dilution of the samples is also appropriate.  The samples are now ready for analysis.  See Related Documents, Section 16 for applicable trace inorganics test methods.\n\nSEMI F48-0600 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING TRACE METALS IN POLYMER MATERIALS - # 12  Recovery Preparation and Percentage Recovery Rate Determination\n\n12.1  Metal recovery percentage mu st be determined for all instruments by the individual laboratory.  This is accomplished via spiking a crucible or digestion vessel containing a polymer sample with a known concentration of metals.  Then, determining the percentage of each metal recovered after the decomposition process or acid digestion.
