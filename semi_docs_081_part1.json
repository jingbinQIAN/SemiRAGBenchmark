Sample size should be determined according to the expected normality and the amount of titrant to be dispensed that will give the optimum precision and accuracy. Generally this is between one-half and threequarters the capacity of the burette.

Users of this standard are expressly advised that determination of any such patent rights or copyrights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, are entirely their own responsibility.\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 1  Scope\n\n1.1  This procedure is an ICP plasma emission analysis for determination of iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, copper, boron, aluminum, chromium, manganese, and nickel in photoresist. The applicable concentration range is 0.1 to 1 ppm when the sample is diluted 1 to 4. The precision was found to be within $0 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ p p m }$ in a round robin analysis between four laboratories.\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 2  Spectrometer\n\n2.1  A grating instrument with reso lution sufficient to separate the analytical emission lines in Table 1 is required.  \nTable 1  Analytical Lines of the Elements\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 3  Sample Preparation\n\n3.1  The sample is diluted 1/4 (1 pa rt of sample plus 3 parts of solvent weight/weight) in 2-methoxyethanol or another suitable solvent for positive resist. The solvent should contain less than 0.03 ppm of the above elements.\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 4  Standards\n\n4.1  The standards should be weigh t/weight $( \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ and should be diluted weight/weight since results will be expressed in $\\mathrm { m g / k g }$ .  \n4.2  The standards are prepared by diluting a concentrated standard of organic-soluble metals in 2- methoxyethanol or other suitable solvent. For example, a $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ standard is diluted to $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ with xylene. This solution is then diluted to $0 . 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { \\ p p m }$ with 2- methoxythanol.\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 5  Plasma Conditions\n\n5.1  The sample is pumped on the r egion of 0.7 $\\mathrm { { \\ m L / m i n } }$ , usually with a perstaltic pump attached to the nebulizer. Choose a tubing that is not attacked by methyl cellosolve (for example, polytetrafluoroethylene). The argon plasma flow rate and RF power should be optimized for the sample using settings recommended in the manufacturer’s manual. Generally, a plasma gas flow rate of $1 6 ~ \\mathrm { { 1 / m i n } }$ . is necessary to ionize organic solutions and an RF power of 1.7 watts is required.\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 6  Quantitation\n\n6.1  The detector gain is set by mea suring the $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { p p m }$ standard. The background is measured with the solvent and several sample measures. The standard and blank should be run intermittently to satisfy reasonable precision. Standard and sample readings should be repeatable within $0 . 0 3 \\mathrm { \\ p p m }$ . The effect of sample viscosity on delivery of diluted resist to the plasma was not found to be a factor for the resist tested for this procedure. This effect can be checked by adding an internal standard of an element known not to be present in the resist (such as Yttrium) at ppm and checking the emission response vs. external 1 ppm Yttrium standard in the diluting solvent.\n\nSEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 7  Calculation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P10-0705SPECIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES FOR PHOTOMASK ORDERS - # 7  Calculation\n\nContent: 7.1 ppm element $\\mathrm { ( m g / k g = p p m }$ m easured $\\times$ delution factor (weight/weight) 7.2 Detection Limit — The detecti on limit is a function of the dilution factor and can vary by instrument.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published in 1991.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 1  Scope\n\n1.1  This procedure is a flame atomic absorption analytical method for sodium and potassium analysis in photoresist. The applicable concentration range is 0.1 to 1 ppm when the sample is diluted one to four. The precision was found to be within 0.1 ppm in a roundrobin analysis between four laboratories.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 2  Referenced Standards\n\n2.1  None.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Terminology\n\n3.1.1  Detection Limit — the detection limit is a function of the dilution factor and can vary by instrument. The dilution factor should be taken into account in calculation of detection limit.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 4  Atomic Absorption Spectrometer\n\n4.1  The analytical wavelength for sodium is $5 8 9 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and for potassium is $7 6 6 . 0 \\textrm { \\ n m }$ . The instrument conditions (i.e., slit width, burner gas flow rates) should be set according to the manufacturer’s manual (the fuel flow should be set to approximately 1/2 the air flow to optimize for organic solvent). Optimize the nebulizer and lamp alignment to maximize the absorbance of the 1 ppm standard.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 5  Sample Preparation\n\n5.1  The sample should be diluted 1/4 (1 part resist and 3 parts of solvents weight/weight) in 2-methoxyethanol or another suitable solvent for positive resist. The solvent should contain less than $0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ of the element being analyzed.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Standards\n\n6.1  The standards should be weight/weight $( \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ and should be diluted weight/weight since results will be expressed in $\\mathrm { m g / k g }$ .  \n6.2  The standards are prepared by diluting a concentrated stock of organic-soluble sodium and potassium. For example, a $5 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ standard of sodium is diluted to $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ with reagent xylene. This solution is then diluted to 1 ppm with 2-methoxyethanol or another suitable solvent.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 7  Procedure\n\n7.1  Set the absorbance reading to zero with the flame ignited and no sample aspirating. Measure the absorbance of the solvent blank. It should not be more than 0.04. Measure the absorbance of the 1 ppm standard and samples. The absorbance of the standard should be in the region of 0.4. Duplicate sample and standard readings should be within 0.01 absorbance. A recovery of $8 8 \\%$ was determined when a 1 ppm potassium internal standard was added to the resist tested. The effect of viscosity on delivery to the burner can be determined by adding 2 ppm of a potassium internal standard to the sample and checking the absorbance versus an external 2 ppm potassium standard in the diluting solvent. The potassium level in the resist, if any, should be subtracted.\n\nSEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 8  Calculation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P13-91 (Reapproved 1104) DETERMINATION OF SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IN POSITIVE PHOTORESISTS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY - # 8  Calculation\n\nContent: ppm $\\mathrm { ( m g / k g ) = }$ Abs.

These standard patterns include cells that can be used for optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and electrical probe testing.  \n1.1.2  This document does not attempt to specify the measurement techniques to be used in verifying critical dimensions for these test patterns on the reticle. Similarly, this document does not attempt to specify how the printed patterns are to be measured on the wafer. This document specifies only what the patterns are supposed to be; it is left to the user to ensure that the actual pattern conforms to this specification, subject to all other applicable SEMI specifications. A separate SEMI document will specify CD measurement conditions (see Section 1.2.1).\n\nSEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 1.2.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI P24 — CD Metrology Procedures\n\nSEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 1.3  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 1.3  Definitions\n\nContent: linewidth — In semiconductor technology, at a given cross-section of the line, the distance between the airline material boundaries at some specified height above the interface between the patterned layer in which the line is formed and the underlying layer (see Figure 1). NOTE: The physical basis for various methods of measuring linewidth may result in the measurements being carried out at differing heights for the same line at the same cross-section. For this reason, substantial method-dependent differences in measurement results may be expected and it is convenient to identify the method used in expressions such as “SEM linewidth,” “optical linewidth,” or “electrical linewidth” (ASTM F 127). Furthermore, the height at which the measurement is taken shall be qualitatively stated, even if it cannot be quantitively determined. feature — areas within a single, continuous boundary (for example, an aggregate image) that have an opticaldensity value (gray-level range), that is distinct from the background area\n\nSEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 1.3  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 1.3  Definitions\n\nContent: outside the feature (ASTM D 3849, D 24) (e.g., the simplest element of a pattern, such as a single line, space, or L-bar). feature group — a small assembly of one or more similar features arranged together, such as three nested L-bars. nominal feature dimension — the linear dimension of interest, such as the linewidth or contact hole width. basic cell — an arrangement of features or groups, as defined by this document, based upon a specific, nominal-feature dimension. composite cell — an arrangement of several basic cells. isolated line — a clearfield, dark line as shown in Figure 2 (SYN: island). 2.1.3 All critical dimensions given i n this document are the actual CAD values at 1X.

If the basic cell only consists of a single feature group, then the lines and spaces must both be equal to the nominal feature width. If the basic cell consists of three, five, or seven groups, then the groups are nested. For the middle group, the lines and spaces must both be equal to the nominal feature width. The feature widths in each successive feature group nested outside the middle group are incrementally increased by the bias. The feature widths in each successive feature group inside the middle group are incrementally decreased by the bias.

The $5 \\times 5$ array will produce the maximal proximity (i.e., dense printing) for the center contact.  The center contact in the $3 \\times 3$ array will exhibit proximal printing effects different from both the isolated contact and the dense contact.\n\nSEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 3.2.5  Staggered Contact Array — (See Figure 10.)\n\n3.2.5.1  The staggered contact array ce ll is designed to improve the probability of cross-sectioning small contacts for SEM metrology analysis.  \n3.2.5.2  The design elements are the sq uare contact dimension, the column-to-column vertical offset — or staggering — and the contact-to-contact spacing. The contact-to-contact spacing will be equal to the square contact dimension.  \n3.2.5.3  The contacts are laid out using a minimum of three columns of contacts. The user-selected offset between columns should allow the contacts to remain on grid.  \n3.2.5.4  The lines (or spaces) shown on the left side of Figure 10 are optional.

Unlike the other cells, its elements are not adjusted to a nominal critical dimension, but rather are numerically specified as constants for all applications.  \n3.2.6.3  The cell consists of nine parall el lines, placed on a five-micron pitch. The linewidths are 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 microns. The line lengths are a minimum of ten microns.

The orientation of the individual bridge resistors is user-defined. The bridge resisitors also can be surrounded by dummy lines to measure the process bias due to proximity effect. On structures containing the dummy lines, the interconnects will hook up to the bridge resistor in a perpendicular fashion, as shown in Figure 14. 3.2.7.4 The pad labeled with a V in Fi gures 13 and 15 will be used for voltage measurement only, and will be used as the fourth point in the sheet resistivity measurements that will be used to make the linewidth determination. 3.2.7.5 The pads can be arranged in a $1 \\times \\mathtt { n }$ layout for scribeline placement (see Figure 15), or the conventional $2 \\times \\mathrm { ~ n ~ }$ layout can be used if the spatial constraints are minimal. Pad size and pitch are userdefined. For automatic testing in a production environment, it is recommended that the pads be 80 – $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ per side.\n\nSEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 3.3.1  Target CD versus Resolved CD\n\n3.3.1.1  The desired size of a critical d imension (CD) on an integrated circuit can be considered its nominal value and is herein designated the “target CD.” The size actually achieved (resolved CD) on the circuit may be different from this nominal value.  \n3.3.1.2  Measurements of the resolved CD may not be accurate because of the difficulty in determining the actual location of the edge in the optical or SEM image profile.  \n3.3.1.3  Even if inaccurate, measureme nt of the resolved CD can be valuable for comparison purposes if the measurement method has adequate precision and sensitivity to detect the dimensional changes of interest.  \n3.3.1.4  The traditional definition of re solution may not be adequate (e.g., ability to distinguish closely spaced points) for specifying the sensitivity to small dimensional changes.\n\nSEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 4  References (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P18-92 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR OVERLAY CAPABILITIES OF WAFER STEPPERS - # 4  References\n\nContent: 4.1 Yen, D., Linholm, L.W., and B uehler, M.G., “A Cross-Bridge Test Structure for Evaluating the Linewidth Uniformity of an Integrated Circuit Lithography System,” J.

Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on September 10, 1999.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2000; to be published February 2000. Originally published in 1993; previously published in 1996.  \nNOTE: These guidelines were rewritten in their entirety in February 2000.\n\nSEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 The purpose of this guideline i s to propose a test mask to be used for evaluation of the sensitivity of Mask Defect Inspection Systems. This test mask consists of test chips including programmed pattern defects and reference test chips without programmed defects. Since the test chip is an assembly of cells, the test chips are defined in this guideline by cell patterns, programmed defects in cell patterns, and the layout of the cells. Also, the test mask is defined by defining the test chips arrangement. Furthermore, the use of this mask is described. It is desirable that these test masks and benchmark procedures be used when the sensitivity of a Mask Defect Inspection System is evaluated. 1.2 Background — Different mask s have been used by many equipment manufacturers and users in the past, and sensitivity has been tested by various methods decided independently by each manufacturer and user. In some cases, no common measurement methods or sensitivity analysis\n\nSEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: methods have been agreed upon. Therefore, confusion exists concerning the sensitivity comparison of equipment between manufacturers, the definition for specifications between users and suppliers, and the definition for specifications between users. Also, due to the fact that several problems were found when using the previous guideline in actual manufacturing, the document has been reviewed and content has been changed throughout. It was also the goal of this revision, while considering ease of manufacturing of test masks first, to fully cover the evaluation of mask defect inspection systems.\n\nSEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This guideline defines the con tent and methods for use of test masks used in the evaluation of mask defect inspection systems.  Although it is possible to use this test mask to evaluate transcription of defects etc., this standard does not attempt to define these processes.  \n2.2  This guideline shall be revised when a new effective measurement technology for defect sizing becomes commonly available in the market.  \n2.3  This guideline does not purpor t to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this guideline to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 3.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI P1  Specification for Hard Surface Photomask Substrates  \nSEMI P22 Guideline for Photomask Defect Classification and Size Definition.  \nSEMI P33 Provisional Specification for Developmental $2 3 0 \\quad \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ Square Hard Surface Photomask Substrates  \nNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be the latest publications of adopted standards.\n\nSEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 4.1  Definitions\n\n4.1.1  Many terms relating to photomask technology are defined in SEMI P22 and SEMI P33.\n4.1.2  design pattern  pattern of intended design data.\n4.1.3  photomask pattern  pattern o n photomask surface.\n\nSEMI P23-0200 GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMMED DEFECT MASKS AND BENCHMARK PROCEDURES FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF MASK DEFECT INSPECTION SYSTEMS - # 5  Mask (See Figure 1)\n\n5.1  Masks will be either $5 \"$ or $6 \"$ which meet SEMI P1; both the $5 \"$ and $6 \"$ will be the same layout.  \n5.2  Masks will be limited to two ty pes, namely Conventional and Attenuated (Half Tone).

It does not address how these systems will be applied to solve problems, nor does it address other contributors to process variations such as thermal wafer processing, exposure tool focus control, materials, etc.  \n1.2  Background — Fundamental to manufacturing is the gauging or measurement process.  It is required initially to develop a usable manufacturing capability and then to verify that what is being manufactured conforms to specification/expectation.\n\nSEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This document discusses determining the performance of gauging/measurement systems for a very specific application — the lithography section of integrated circuit wafer fabrication. This document in many cases, will be applicable to IC mask-making, in which case the word “mask” can be substituted for “wafer.” 2.2 It is acknowledged that the final measurement for a fabricated wafer is the electrical functionality. However, the intermediate lithographic measurements can be useful in prediction and control of final functionality. This document is intended to be useful for this litho-metrology application, irrespective of the technology employed. 2.3 Measurement results and system performance depend on the sample(s) used. Therefore, performance for different systems or the same system at different times can only be appropriately compared when the measurements are obtained with a sample of the same material composition. 2.4 The parameter addressed is precision. Additional important parameters are reliability and cleanliness, which have been addressed\n\nSEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: by other SEMI standards.

The spread or variation of measurement in test A is smaller than that in test B. The results of test A are more precise than the results from test B. See Figure 1. NOTE 2: Any test procedure used needs to differentiate between system and wafer contribution. 5.1.3 repeatability — the standard deviation of results obtained by the same operator using the same instrument in successive measurements [ASTM C 609, C-21]. The same system parameters need to be used. The degree to which the individual operator affects the measured result is a critical parameter and must be identified and benchmarked. NOTE 3: The degree to which the individual operator affects the measured result may be a critical parameter and must be identified. 5.1.4\n\nSEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: reproducibility — the precision of a test method expressed in terms of agreement expected between measurements made in different laboratories using similar apparatus and the same procedure [ASTM D 4790, D-16]. 5.1.5 stability — the standard deviation of means of groups of measurements taken at specified intervals over an extended period of time. NOTE 4: The means are used to avoid including the measurement precision. Stability is a characterization of the system independent of precision. It is important to use a stable sample so that system stability, independent of the sample, is determined. 5.1.6 standard deviation — a measure of the dispersion of a series of results around their average, expressed as the square root of the quantity, obtained by adding the squares of the deviations from the average of the results and dividing by the number of observations minus one. It is also the square root of the variance and can be calculated as follows: $$ s = { \\sqrt { \\frac { \\sum \\left( x _ { i } = { \\overline { { x } } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } { n - 1 }\n\nSEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI P24-94 (Reapproved 1104) CD METROLOGY PROCEDURES - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: } } $$ Where: $\\mathbf { s } = \\mathbf { \\partial }$ estimated standard deviation of the series of results $\\mathrm { X _ { i } = }$ each individual value ${ \\overline { { \\mathrm { X } } } } =$ average (arithmetic mean) of all values, and $\\mathbf { n } =$ number of values The following forms of this equation are more convenient for computation, especially when using a calculator: $$ s = { \\sqrt { \\frac { \\sum x ^ { 2 } - \\left( \\sum x \\right) ^ { 2 } / n } { n - 1 } } } $$ or $$ s = { \\sqrt { \\frac { n { \\sum x ^ { 2 } - ( \\sum x ) } ^ { 2 } } { n ( n - 1 ) } } } $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l r l } { \\mathbf { s } } & { { } } & { = } \\end{array}$ estimated standard deviation $\\Sigma ^ { x ^ { 2 } } = \\mathrm { s u m }$ of the squares of all the individual values $( \\sum x ) ^ { 2 } = { \\mathfrak { g } }$ square of the total of the individual values, and $\\mathbf { n } =$ number of values NOTE 5: Care must be taken in using either of these equations that a sufficient number of decimal places is carried in the sum of the values and in the",
