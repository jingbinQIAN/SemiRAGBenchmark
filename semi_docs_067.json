The absorbance for silicon tetrafluoride is determined by compensating for the interfering absorbance from the tungsten hexafluoride. Compensation is made by subtracting the absorbance contributed to this band by tungsten hexafluoride band at 930 $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ . This absorbance is halved and subtracted from the total peak absorbance at $1 0 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ , resulting in the peak absorbance for silicon tetrafluoride. NOTE 2: Actual detection limits will be determined by the noise level and the resolution of the spectrometer. One way is to reduce the noise level is to use a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer.

This specification describes a standard shock test that fulfills the above requirements and provides a procedure to count particles immediately after the shock. 2.5 If this test method is to be used for more than one cylinder, then each cylinder must be tested. It is known that particle contamination in cylinder gases is a strong function of the handling history of the individual cylinders. Cylinders in the same batch of filling are usually returned from various customers after various periods of service. Uniform quality can not be assumed for the same batch of cylinders unless each of them has gone through a dedicated process that erases the memory of previous history prior to filling.

All components used in the test apparatus, including the flowmeter, valves, tubing, and filter housing, are $2 . 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ (1 inch) components or have $2 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ (1 inch) inlet and outlet connections. The apparatus consists of (1) a differential pressure"

These precautions may include, but are not limited to, installation in a Class 100 laminar flow area, installation in a purged glove bag or other controlled ambient enclosure, use of a purge flow downstream of the sample point so that all parts of the system are under purge, isolation, or termination of the CNC sample flow,"

Care should be taken to provide an adequate exhaust length so that back diffusion of particles does not affect the system background at 2 times the sampling flow rate. This length will depend upon the particle concentration in the ambient environment and other factors."
