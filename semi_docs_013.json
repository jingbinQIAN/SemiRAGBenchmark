One method measures it directly at the operating frequency and the other measures the half-wave resonant frequency to determine the electrical length. Each method has advantages, depending on the length of the cable assembly. Prior to choosing a method, the equivalent free-space length of the DUT shall be estimated in units of distance (i.e., meters). This length can be estimated by dividing the physical length of the DUT by the velocity of propagation for the particular type of cable. For example, a DUT made from RG-217 cable with a physical length of 20 meters and a velocity of propagation of 0.66 would have an equivalent freespace length of 30.303 meters $2 0 / 0 . 6 6 = 3 0 . 3 0 3$ ).

Lumping the total losses into an overall series loss will also cause a slight shift in the reactive part of the impedance, but the magnitude of the shift is on the same order as the impedance measurement uncertainty and can be ignored.  \n9.2  The second method is designed for other matching network types and uses a load simulator to determine the load impedance and efficiency."

By tracking equipment systems in terms of modules that perform tasks, it will be possible to precisely identify the affect of both factors toward overall system performance. 8.3 EPT enables tracking to this level of detail by introducing the concept of an EPT module and the concept of a task. EPT-compliant equipment are required to report events according to a breakdown of equipment operations into tasks and EPT modules. An EPT module is an equipment component that affects processing or throughput, and is capable of executing only one task at a time. Examples of EPT modules include"

Examples of tasks include the following: Move wafer from cassette to stage Pre-align wafer Align reticle Preheat chamber Increase vacuum etc. 8.4 EPT-compliant equipment consist of EPT modules that perform tasks. Thus, the state of the equipment can be effectively modeled as a composition of the states of the EPT modules. In addition, EPT provides detailed information required for performance tracking by providing the task-level details for each EPT module. 8.5 EPT modules and tasks are to be defined such that each EPT module executes only one task at a time. An example is given in Related Information $\\ S _ { \\mathrm { R 1 - 7 } }$ .

A change in any of the following items should result in the start of a new task or completion of current task: • Change in material involved (e.g., arrival of wafer, removal of wafer) • Change of EPT modules involved (e.g., robot moves wafer, chamber processes wafer) • Change in task type (e.g., purge recipe followed by production recipe) NOTE 1: It is not practical for equipment to define tasks or modules at an indefinite level of detail. It is therefore recommended that in each instance for which the material involved, the EPT modules involved, and the task types are all constant, events for only one task should be reported. Any further breakdown is not required for EPT compliance. EPT places no limitations on supplemental event reporting within any task.

Although the carrier transport systems shown in these figures represent an overhead transport system using an OHT delivery vehicle, they are intended to represent all types of transport systems (AGV, PGV, conveyor, overhead track, etc.). 6.2 Orientation — The reticles are to be oriented horizontally (chrome down) with zero nominal tilt when the RSP is placed on the load port. The tolerance in the horizontal plane is determined by the registration and alignment feature between the RSP and the load port, as specified in SEMI E19.3 or SEMI E19.4. The RSP shall be loaded and unloaded with its front (where reticles are inserted and extracted after the SMIF pod is opened) parallel to and away from the load face plane (see Figure 2). 6.3 Side Clearances — Clearances C1 and C2 are defined with respect to the maximum dimensions of the footprint of the RSP (as"

Note that C1 is lateral clearance to the left and right of the RSP, but C2 is a radial clearance from the nearest point of the RSP. 6.4 Overhead Clearances — All load ports intended for automated overhead access must be open from above to facilitate automatic RSP delivery. The open volume required for automated overhead delivery is defined by a projection of the load port area, including the area required for C1 and C2 clearances, projected upward to the top of the equipment. To allow space for overhead delivery above H2, D1 also defines the open volume. Note that this condition need only be met when the equipment is being loaded or unloaded. For example, the load port may be formed by a surface that extends outward during loading to provide overhead access. 6.5 Easement for Overhead Transport — As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, to add clearance for overhead RSP transport, no part of the equipment may be higher than H2 above the floor along an"

All equipment must have at least one load port with access for automated overhead delivery. At least two of these load ports are recommended to support equipment throughput. Auxiliary load ports intended for manual delivery may be located on a different side of the equipment.

IDLE and BUSY correspond to substates of the same names in the WIDR state model.  If any head is NOT OPERATING, then the active substate of ALARM STATUS in the WIDR state model is ALARMS.  \n9.3.3  The NOT OPERATING state is not required, if it is not possible to detect alarms related to the head.  Note also that some alarm conditions are fatal (so that the head cannot operate with full functionality) while others may not be fatal.  \n9.3.4  Figure 2 shows the diagram for the Read Head State Model.  \n9.3.5  Table 5 defines the states for the Read Head.  \nTable 5  Read Head State Definitions  \n9.3.6  Table 6 defines the transitions of the Read Head State Model."
