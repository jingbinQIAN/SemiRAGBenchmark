At least one drawing originally filed was informal and the print reproduced here is taken from a later filed formal copy.\n\nBackground to the invention\n\nElectronic device manufacturers are constantly striving to increase the performance of their products, while decreasing their cost of manufacture. The family of electronic devices also contains semiconductor devices. A cost intensive area in the manufacture of semiconductor devices is packaging the semiconductor chips. As those skilled in the art are aware, integrated circuits are most often fabricated in wafers, which are then singulated (also known as diced) to produce semiconductor chips, which are also known as semiconductor die or die. Dies range from LED lighting to power semiconductor devices to central processing units. There are three commonly used plural forms: dice, dies, and die. In the case of power electronic semiconductors, each semiconductor die provides a maximum amount of current which it can switch and conduct for a given semiconductor junction temperature without damage. Semiconductor die are often electrically connected (also known as coupled) in parallel to provide a larger overall current rating. Semiconductor die are also electrically connected in different configurations to provide different functionalities. Conventionally, one or more semiconductor die are placed in a package to protect them from environmental and physical stresses. Packaging semiconductor die increases the cost and complexity of manufacturing semiconductor devices because the packaging designs do not only provide protection, but also permit transmission of electrical signals to and from the semiconductor chips and, in particular, removal of heat generated by the semiconductor die. Each package design requires extensive development and testing and often results in the need for a specific production line for each configuration, which reduces the agility and flexibility of production while increasing cost. In the case of power semiconductor die, for example, the circuit parasitics (inductance, capacitance and/or resistance) greatly affect the overall efficiency of the system. These parasitics may be reduced through careful package design; however, there are limits to this reduction when using conventional manufacturing methods such as busbars. In an ideal situation, high energy connectors would be closely coupled to reduce inductance, for example. The rate at which losses in the form of heat energy can be removed from the power semiconductor die becomes a limiting factor to the overall power rating of the package. Conventional methods result in high levels of thermal resistance between the semiconductor die and the cooling medium, such as a circulating fluid which is cooled external to the package. Hence, there is a need to improve packaging of semiconductor die.\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\nA first aspect provides a method of packaging semiconductor die, the method comprising: placing a first set of semiconductor die, including a first semiconductor die, at a respective first set of placements, including a first placement; and providing a first package, having a first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die comprising additive manufacturing, for example ink jetting, and/or hybrid manufacturing.

An electronic or electrical component may be a semiconductor chip (also known as a semiconductor die), a power semiconductor die, a passive component or a sensor, for example. A semiconductor chip may be for example a control IC, a monitor IC, a sensor IC, a microprocessor or a power semiconductor die, for example. A power semiconductor die may be any topology and technology for example MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), JFETs (Junction Gate Field Effect Transistors) topologies and Si, SiC, SiGe, GaAs, GaN technologies, for example. A passive component may be a resistor, an inductor, a delay line, an antenna, or a capacitor, for example. Additive manufacture (AM), also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is the process of joining materials to make 3D objects, also known as articles, from 3D model data. Ink jetting is an additive manufacturing process in which a printhead selectively deposits a liquid binding agent (also known as an ink, a binder or an ink formulation) onto a thin layer of powder particles, to build (for example manufacture) parts or articles and tooling, for example. A half-bridge is a DC-to-AC step-down converter. It is a “two-quadrant converter” because the load current can flow in both directions. This is a critical feature when driving an inductive load with an AC waveform. 35 with an AC waveform. In a totem pole configuration, all power devices are connected in series with their anti-parallel diodes all in the same direction. A bidirectional switch controls current flow in both directions by, for example, employing two power devices connected in series with the anti-parallel diodes of each device in opposite directions. A three-level inverter phase can switch between three voltages levels. The most common topologies are the Diode Clamped Inverter and the T-Type inverter. Electrical parasitics include AC loop inductance, which causes voltage overshoot during and immediately after a switching event, and local output capacitance, in which energy is lost during a switch transition in order to charge and discharge this capacitance. More generally, in electrical networks such as electronic modules, a parasitic element is a circuit element (resistance, inductance and/or capacitance) that is possessed by an electrical component or electrical but which it is not desirable for it to have for its intended purpose.\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided a method, as set forth in the appended claims.

In this way, the first set of semiconductor die is packaged by additive manufacturing, at least in part, the first package, thereby protecting the first set of semiconductor die from environmental and/or physical stresses. Since the first package is provided, at least in part, by additive manufacturing, the first structure of the first package may be specific (i.e. custom, tailored, individual), for example to reduced parasitics and/or improve removal of heat, thereby enhancing efficiency in use. In this way, agility and/or flexibility of production of the packaged semiconductor die is improved, since the same production line may be used for producing packaged semiconductor die having different structures. The method is of packaging semiconductor die, thereby providing a packaged semiconductor die. Conventional packaged semiconductor die are known. In contrast to conventional packaged semiconductor die, each packaged semiconductor die provided by the method according to the first aspect may comprise different sets of semiconductor die, optionally at different respective placements, and/or different packages having respectively different structures while produced using the same production line, comprising an additive manufacturing apparatus, for example a binder jet apparatus.

In one example, the first set of semiconductor die includes a second semiconductor die, for example wherein the second semiconductor die is as described with respect to the first semiconductor die, for example wherein the first semiconductor die and the second semiconductor die have the same topology and/or technology or wherein the first semiconductor die and the second semiconductor die have mutually different topology and/or technology. In one example, the first set of semiconductor die includes N semiconductor die, wherein N is a natural number greater than or equal to 2, for example 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more. The N semiconductor die maybe as described with respect to the first semiconductor die or the second semiconductor die. It should be understood that the first semiconductor die is placed (i.e. physically positioned or located) at the first placement (i.e position or location). It should be understood that the respective first set of placements of the first set of semiconductor die are mutually relative and may be defined absolutely, for example in two or three dimensions with respect to a predetermined reference, or relatively, for example in two or three dimensions with respect to the first of semiconductor die, for example a datum thereof. In one example, the step of placing the first set of semiconductor die, including the first semiconductor die, at the respective first set of placements, including the first placement, precedes the step of providing, at least in part, the first package, having the first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die comprising additive manufacturing. In this way, the first set of semiconductor die is placed and the first package is subsequently provided thereupon and/or therearound. In one example, the step of placing the first semiconductor die at the respective first placement precedes this step of providing the first package, having a first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die comprising additive manufacturing. In this way, the first semiconductor die is placed and the first package is subsequently provided, at least in part, thereupon and/or therearound. Subsequently, a second semiconductor die may be placed at a respective second placement and the step of providing the first package continued. In one example, the step of placing the first set of semiconductor die, including the first semiconductor die, at the respective first set of placements, including the first placement, proceeds the step of providing, at least in part, the first package, having the first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die comprising additive manufacturing. In this way, the first package is provided, at least in part, and subsequently, the first set of semiconductor die is placed thereupon and/or therein, whereupon the step of providing, at least in part, the first package may be continued. In one example, the step of placing the first semiconductor die at the respective first placement precedes this step of providing the first package, having a first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die comprising additive manufacturing. In this way, the first semiconductor die is placed and the first package is subsequently provided, at least in part, thereupon and/or therearound. Subsequently, a second semiconductor die may be placed at a respective second placement and the step of providing the first package continued. More generally, the first set of semiconductor die may be placed before, during and/or after providing the first package. In this way, the first set of semiconductor die may be placed mutually relatively in three dimensions at different stages of the additive manufacturing, thereby packaging the first set of semiconductor die in three dimensional placements and/or topologies that may not be achieved conventionally.

In this way, different structures (for example having different interconnects) are provided for the first and second package, which have the same semiconductor die placements. In one example, placing the first set of semiconductor die, including the first semiconductor die, at the respective first set of placements, including the first placement, is performed during the additive manufacturing and/or the hybrid manufacturing, for example by the additive manufacturing apparatus, which may additionally and/or alternatively place other electronic or electrical components. For example, the additive manufacturing apparatus may include a separate “pick and place” function on the same xy gantry, or a separate gantry for this placement. The method comprises providing the first package, having the first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die. Generally, a semiconductor package (also known as a package) is a metal, plastic, glass, or ceramic casing containing one or more discrete semiconductor die. The package provides a means for connecting the semiconductor die to the external environment, such as a printed circuit board, via leads such as lands, balls, or pins; and protection against threats such as mechanical impact, chemical contamination, and light exposure. Additionally, the package helps dissipate heat produced by the device, with or without the aid of a heat spreader. In one example, the first structure comprises a first set of electrical couplings (also known as interconnects), including a first electrical coupling, wherein the first electrical coupling is electrical couplings is provided by additive manufacturing, as described herein. In this way, the first semiconductor die may be electrically coupled to a second semiconductor die included in the set thereof via the first electrical coupling. Additionally and/or alternatively, in this way, the first semiconductor die may be electrically coupleable to an external component via the first electrical coupling. In one example, the first set of semiconductor die includes N semiconductor die, wherein N is a natural number greater than or equal to 1, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, including the first semiconductor die, and the first structure comprises the first set of electrical couplings includes C electrical couplings, wherein C is a natural number greater than or equal to 1, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, including a first electrical coupling, wherein the first electrical coupling is electrically coupled to the first semiconductor die and optionally, wherein the C electrical couplings mutually electrically couple semiconductor die. In one example, the first electrical coupling is provided by a first layer or a part thereof, for example only by a first layer or a part thereof, within the first structure, for example by patterning the first layer, for example only the first layer or a part thereof, during the additive manufacturing. In this way, the first electrical coupling may be provided within a layer (i.e. in plane) of the additively manufactured first structure. In one example, the first electrical coupling is provided by two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof, for example by patterning the two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof during the additive manufacturing. In this way, the first electrical coupling may be provided through two or more adjacent layers (i.e. through thickness) of the additively manufactured first structure. In one example, the first electrical coupling is provided by a first layer or a part thereof within the first structure, for example by patterning the first layer, during the additive manufacturing and by two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof, for example by patterning the two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof during the additive manufacturing. In this way, the first electrical coupling may be provided partly within a layer (i.e. in plane) and partly through two or more adjacent layers (i.e. through thickness). In this way, the first electrical coupling may be routed in three dimensions around other electrical couplings, electrical isolators, thermal couplings and/or semiconductor die, for example. Such routing is In one example, the first structure comprises a first set of electrical isolators, including a first electrical isolator, wherein the first electrical isolator is disposed to electrically isolate a part of the first semiconductor die and/or an electrical coupling. It should be understood that the first set of electrical isolators is provided by additive manufacturing, as described herein. In this way, semiconductor die and/or electrical couplings may be mutually electrically isolated, for example. In one example, the first structure comprises the first set of electrical isolators includes | electrical isolators, wherein | is a natural number greater than or equal to 1, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, including a first electrical isolator, wherein the first electrical isolator is disposed to electrically isolate a part of the first semiconductor die and/or an electrical coupling. In one example, the first electrical isolator is provided by a first layer or a part thereof, for example only by a first layer or a part thereof, within the first structure, for example by patterning the first layer, for example only the first layer or a part thereof, during the additive manufacturing. In this way, the first electrical isolator may be provided within a layer (i.e. in plane) of the additively manufactured first structure. In one example, the first electrical isolator is provided by two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof, for example by patterning the two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof during the additive manufacturing. In this way, the first electrical isolator may be provided through two or more adjacent layers (i.e. through thickness) of the additively manufactured first structure. In one example, the first electrical isolator is provided by a first layer or a part thereof within the first structure, for example by patterning the first layer, during the additive manufacturing and by two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof, for example by patterning the two or more adjacent layers or parts thereof during the additive manufacturing. In this way, the first electrical isolator may be provided partly within a layer (i.e. in plane) and partly through two or more adjacent layers (i.e. through thickness). In this way, the first electrical isolator may be routed in three dimensions around other electrical isolators, electrical couplings, thermal isolators and/or semiconductor die, for example. Such routing is generally not possible via conventional packaging processes. In one example, the first structure comprises a first set of thermal couplings, including a first thermal coupling, wherein the first thermal coupling is thermally coupled to the first semiconductor die. In this way, removal of heat may be improved. In one example, the first thermal coupling comprises and/or is a passageway (a conduit, a channel or a pipe), for example for circulation of a coolant fluid therethrough. In one example, the first thermal coupling is provided by the first electrical coupling or the first electrical isolator. In one example, the first thermal coupling is not provided by the first electrical coupling and/or the first electrical isolator. For example, the first thermal coupling may have a different material composition (e.g. lower thermal resistance) and/or the first thermal coupling may be either electrically conductive or electrically insulative. For example, the first thermal coupling may comprise a tube created in the other structures to take either an electrically conductive liquid (e.g. water) within the insulator part or a non-conductive liquid (e.g. dielectric oil) for either conductor or insulator parts. In one example, the first structure comprises a first set of passive components, including a first passive component. In this way, parasitics may be reduced. In one example, the first passive component comprises and/or is a resistor, an inductor, a delay line, an antenna or a capacitor. In one example, the first package comprises a first set of electrical or electronic components, including a first electrical or electronic component, for example inserted therein, such as a current sensor embedded in, or adjoining, the first set of electrical couplings.

Additive manufacturing ink jetting Providing the first package, having the first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die comprises additive manufacturing, for example ink jetting, and/or hybrid manufacturing, for example layer manufacturing. Additive manufacturing (AM), popularly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, generally refers to processes used to create articles or objects from layers of material sequentially formed under computer control. Additive manufacturing provides creation of articles having complex shapes, geometries or structures, including internal voids, that may not readily be formed according to conventional subtractive manufacturing processes, such as machining, or conventional casting or moulding processes. Materials suitable for additive manufacturing include metals, ceramics, glasses and polymers. ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of additive manufacturing processes, including ink jetting in which a liquid bonding agent (also known as an ink formulation) is selectively deposited to join powder materials. Hybrid manufacturing includes Additive/Subtractive Hybrid Manufacturing (ASHM), which involves additive and subtractive manufacturing. Hybrid manufacturing also includes layer manufacturing, used to create articles or objects from layers, such as previously formed layers, which are sequentially stacked, thereby providing the benefits of additive manufacturing. The inventors have determined that additive manufacturing and/or hybrid manufacturing may be used to provide a specific structure of the package, for example to reduce parasitics and/or improve removal of heat while providing interconnects, for example for individual packages and/or limited batches, such as using the same production line. Additionally and/or alternatively, additive manufacturing and/or hybrid manufacturing may be used to interconnect the semiconductor die in topologies, for example in three dimensions, but may not be realisable using conventional processes. In one example, the ink jetting comprises: forming a first part having a first electrical conductivity comprising selectively jetting the first layer using a first ink formulation; and wherein the first part is disposed to electrically couple to the first semiconductor die and/or electrically isolate the first semiconductor die. In this way, the first part provides an electrical coupling or an electrical isolator, as described herein, depending on the first ink formulation, for example as described with respect to the fourth aspect. In one example, providing the first package for the first set of semiconductor die comprises additive manufacturing the placed first set of semiconductor die. In this way, the semiconductor die are provided, at least in part by additive manufacturing i.e. in situ. In one example, the additive manufacturing comprises providing a void in the first layer and depositing materials and/or fluid therein. In this way, the materials and/or fluid are inserted during at least one pause in the additive manufacture process, for example whereby additional materials are poured into a surface orifice and thus into a void created when the powder is removed.\n\n35 Computer, computer program, non-transient computer-readable storage medium\n\nThe second aspect provides a computer comprising a processor and a memory configured to implement, at least in part, a method according to the first aspect, a computer program comprising instructions which, when executed by a computer comprising a processor and a memory, cause the computer to perform a method, at least in part, according to the first aspect or a non-transient computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions which, when executed by a computer comprising a processor and a memory, cause the computer to perform a method, at least in part, according to the first aspect.\n\nPackaged semiconductor die\n\nThe third aspect provides a packaged semiconductor die comprising: a first set of semiconductor die, including a first semiconductor die, placed at a respective first set of placements, including a first placement; and a first package, having a first structure, for the first set of semiconductor die, wherein the first package is provided, at least in part, by additive manufacturing, for example ink jetting, and/or hybrid manufacturing. In one example, the first structure comprises a first set of electrical isolators, including a first electrical isolator, wherein the first electrical isolator is disposed to electrically isolate a part of the first semiconductor die. In one example, the first structure comprises a first set of thermal couplings, including a first thermal coupling, wherein the first thermal coupling is thermally coupled to the first semiconductor die.\n\n25 Method of ink jetting\n\nThe fourth aspect provides a method of ink jetting, the method comprising: providing a first layer of a first powder comprising a first material; forming a first part having a first electrical conductivity comprising selectively jetting the first layer using a first ink formulation; and 30 using a first ink formulation; and forming a second part having a second electrical conductivity comprising selectively jetting the first layer using a second ink formulation. In this way, the electrical conductivity of the bonded powder comprising the first material is determined by which ink formulation is used for binding the powder. Hence, the first part, having the first electrical conductivity, is formed by jetting the first powder comprising the first material with the first ink formulation while the second part, having the second electrical conductivity, is formed by jetting the first powder comprising the first material (i.e. the same material) with the second ink formulation. In this way, different parts of the first layer may have different electrical conductivities according to which ink formulation and/or dosing thereof is used for the selective jetting. For example, the first part may be an electrical coupling such as an interconnect while the second part may be an electrical isolator, for example surrounding the first part and thereby electrically isolating the electrical coupling from other electrical couplings, for example. In this way, electrical couplings and/or electrical isolators may be provided by the ink jetting in one or more layers (i.e. in 2D or 3D) of the same material, thereby providing relatively complex routes in 2D or 3D. It should be understood that the method according to the fourth aspect may be more generally applied to multilayer ink jetting. Ink jetting The method is of ink jetting (also known as binder jet 3D printing, powder bed and inkjet printing and drop-on-powder printing. Suitable apparatuses for ink jetting are known. Ink jetting is an additive manufacturing process in which a printhead selectively deposits a liquid binding agent (also known as a binder or an ink formulation) onto a thin layer of powder particles, to build (for example manufacture) parts or articles and tooling, for example. By repeating the steps of providing a thin layer of powder particles and selectively depositing liquid binding agent thereupon, 3D parts or articles may be manufactured. 20 First layer The method comprises providing the first layer of the first powder comprising the first material. Methods of providing layers for ink jetting are known. The first powder comprises the first material. In one example, the first powder consist essentially of the first material or consist of the first material. It should be understood that the first part and the second part are both formed from the first powder comprising the first material of the first layer i.e. from the same material notwithstanding that different ink formulations are used for the first part and the second part. In one example, the method comprises: 30 providing a second layer on the first layer; selectively jetting the second layer using the first ink formulation; and/or selectively jetting the second layer using the second ink formulation.\n\nFirst part\n\nThe method comprises forming the first part having the first electrical conductivity comprising selectively jetting the first layer using the first ink formulation. It should be understood that the first part is formed in the first layer. It should be understood that the first ink formulation binds the first powder of the first layer to form the part and determines the electrical conductivity thereof. In one example, the first ink formulation oxidises the first material, for example upon contacting and/or heating. In this way, the first material may be oxidised to provide an electrical insulator, for example. In one example, selectively jetting the first layer using the first ink formulation comprises oxidising the first material, for example thereby providing an oxide of the first material. In one example, forming the first part having the first electrical conductivity comprises heating the first layer, for example after forming the first part and/or the second part and/or before providing a second layer (i.e. interlayer heating). More generally, in one example, the first ink formulation causes or renders the first material to become an electrical insulator and/or electrically insulates the first material, for example upon contacting and/or heating. In one example, the first part comprises and/or is an electrical isolator for an electrical component. In one example, the first electrical conductivity is relatively lower than the second electrical conductivity, for example by one, two, three, four, five, six or more orders of magnitude. In one example, the first ink formulation comprises and/or is a resistive ink, for example comprising an electrical insulator such as an oxide. For example, a resistive ink may comprise AlzO3 nano particles (generally as small as possible to aid sintering of resistive layer at Cu sintering temperatures) suspended in liquid. Could contain yttrium butoxide or some other oxide forming butoxide. Jetting would be in humidity-controlled environment. After jetting first layer, water vapour is brought into the chamber to convert yttrium butoxide to yttria to bind to the AlbO3 particles and Cu. Other resistive inks include: . YSZ ink — Ink based on decomposition and oxidation of Yttrium and Zirconium containing solution. Ratio of Y to Zr can be easily controlled during formulation to tailor electrical properties. 100% ZrO2 resistivity around 3.1 x10*12 Q.cm, 100% Y203 resistivity around 2.8 x10°6 Q.cm.

Furthermore, the semiconductor device may include control circuits, microprocessors or microelectromechanical components. Semiconductor die having a vertical structure may be involved, that is to say that the semiconductor die may be fabricated in such a way that electric currents can flow in a direction perpendicular to the main faces of the semiconductor die. A semiconductor die having a vertical structure may have contact elements on its two main faces, that is, on its top side and bottom side. Power semiconductor die may have a vertical structure.

Figure 2C schematically illustrates a pair of half bridge configurations 202 with each switch implemented using one die. Figure 2D schematically illustrates four die in a totem pole configuration 203 and also how the external connection of two additional diodes would provide a three-level inverter phase overall. Figure 2E schematically illustrates two die as a bidirectional switch 204 connected to a half bridge would provide a T-Type three-level inverter phase. Figure 2F schematically illustrates a pair of two die as a bidirectional switch 205 with a common output. Each of these example electrical configurations will be described in detail in turn.

The structural principals described herein may be adapted to a single die within semiconductor device 200 up to an unlimited number of die. Semiconductor devices 201, 202 and 205 require at least 2 die. Semiconductor device 203 requires at least 4 die. Semiconductor device 204 requires at least 4 die total ifthe bidirectional switch is being provided using two die, and 3 die total if the bidirectional switch is being provided using one die of a bidirectional format. Figure 3A schematically depicts the four die of Figure 2A in more detail, connected in parallel to provide a single switch element; Figure 3B schematically depicts the four die according to an exemplary embodiment, as a mechanical representation (plan view); and Figures 3C and 3D schematically depict the four die of Figure 3B, as alternative exemplary embodiments. Figure 3, comprising Figures 3A to 3D, schematically illustrates four die connected in parallel to provide a single switch element. The example shown uses four die, 303, 304, 305 and 306. Figure 3B shows a plan view (from the top) of a common flat die structure 300 where the die are not stacked using a first variant of the common die positions. Figure 3C shows a plan view (from the top) of an alternative embedment of a common flat die structure 313 where the DC power planes have been extended to increase coupling and reduce parasitic inductance. Figure 3D shows a side view stacked variant 312 which has the second variant of the die positions. The common die positions have been optimised so that the die positions do not require changing in order to support alternative package configurations. As shown in Figure 3A, each die 303, 304, 305 and 306 is connected in parallel with each die drain connected to the upper conductor 310 and each die source connected to the lower conductor 311. In standard operation, the gate control signal of each die would trigger conduction at the same time so that the combined configuration acts as a single switch. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that individual control of each die is also possible for example during low current switching or in reaction to one of the die overheating or failing. As shown in Figure 3B, each die 303, 304, 305 and 306 is connected to the appropriate conduction in the simplest fashion, being two separate flat conducting layers, 301 and 302. These layers are extended in Figure 3C in order to increase coupling and reduce parasitic inductance. Those skilled in the art will be able to adapt this method to include other signals such as the gate control signals. As shown in Figure 3D, the conductors, 308 and 309, bend around the die. The locations of the die are in a second variant of a common position, as will be seen in further figures. The bending of the conductors has been optimised so that the die positions do not require changing in order to support alternative package function configurations. Figure 4A schematically depicts the half bridge configuration of Figure 2B in more detail, with each switch implemented using two die; Figure 4B schematically depicts the half bridge configuration according to an exemplary embodiment, as a mechanical representation (plan view); and Figures 4C, 4D and 4E schematically depict the half bridge configuration of Figure 4B, as alternative exemplary embodiments.

Each die 304 and 305 is connected in parallel with each die drain connected to the mid conductor 400 and each die source connected to the lower conductor 311. Within die structure 401, each die 303, 304, 305 and 306 is connected to the appropriate conduction in the simplest fashion, being three separate flat conducting layers: upper conductor 405, mid conductor 406 and lower conductor 407. These layers are extended in die structure 403 in orderto increase coupling and reduce parasitic inductance: upper conductor 414, mid conductor 415 and lower conductor 416. In die structure 404, the die are stacked in the second variant of the common die position. The upper conductor 411, the mid conductor 412 and the lower conductor 413 are not required to bend and thus may be made of simple flat layers. In die structure 402, the upper conductor 408, the mid conductor 409 and the lower conductor 410 are not required to bend and thus may be made of simple flat layers. The source of die 303 may be in direct contact with the drain of die 304, or they may be pre-bonded before placement, or they may be bonded in situ. This is similar in the case of die 306 and 305. Figure 5 schematically illustrates a pair of half bridge configurations with each switch implemented using one die. The example shown uses four die. The electrical circuit is shown in 202. 303 and 306 are in parallel and form the upper switch. 305 and 306 are in parallel and form the lower switch. Figure 5A schematically depicts the pair of half bridge configurations of Figure 2C in more detail, with each switch implemented using one die; Figure 5B schematically depicts the pair of half bridge configurations according to an exemplary embodiment, as a mechanical representation (plan view); and Figures 5C and 5D schematically depict the half bridge configuration of Figure 5B, as alternative exemplary embodiments.

Those skilled in the art will see how this configuration may be adapted to also use a structure similar to that shown in in Figure 4C. Within die structure 202 of Figure 5A, each die 303 and 306 is connected with each die drain connected to the upper conductor 310 and each die source connected to a different mid conductor: mid conductor 500 in the case of die 303 and mid conductor 501 in the case of die 306. Each die 304 and 305 is connected with each die source connected to the lower conductor 311 and each die drain connected to a different mid conductor: mid conductor 500 in the case of die 304 and mid conductor 501 in the case of die 305. Within die structure 503, each die 303, 304, 305 and 306 is connected to the appropriate conduction in the simplest fashion, being four separate flat conducting layers: upper conductor 504, mid conductors 505 and 506 and lower conductor 507. These layers are extended in die structure 505 in order to increase coupling and reduce parasitic inductance: upper conductor 512, mid conductors 513 and 514 and lower conductor 515. In die structure 504, the die are stacked in the second variant of the common die position. The upper conductor 508, the mid conductors 509 and 510 and the lower conductor 511 are not required to bend and thus may be made of simple flat layers.

When used as a three-level inverter phase, the upper DC supply would be on conductor 310, the mid voltage on conductor 603 and the lower DC supply on conductor 311. Die 303 is the upper switch and is connected between the upper internal connector 604 and the upper DC supply would be on conductor 310. Die 304 is the upper mid switch and is connected between the phase output conductor 605 and the upper internal connector 604.

In die structure 204, when used as a T-Type three-level inverter phase, the upper DC supply is on conductor 310, the mid voltage on conductor 703 and the lower DC supply on conductor 311. Die 303 and 304 have drains connected to connector 704 to form a bidirectional switch. Alternatively, both sources could be connected via 704 instead of both drains. Alternatively, each die 303 and 304 could be connected in parallel to the mid voltage supply, 703, through diodes in a parallel T configuration. Those skilled in the art would be able to make this modification to the structure. In the current example, die 303 has source connected to the mid voltage supply, 703 and die 304 has source connected to the output phase conductor, 705. Die 306 and 305 form a half-bridge between the upper DC supply conductor 310 and the lower DC supply conductor 311, with the output phase conductor 705.

Those skilled in the art will see how this configuration may be adapted to also use a structure similar to that shown in die structure 402 of Figure 4C. Within die structure 700, each die 303, 304, 305 and 306 is connected to the appropriate conduction in the simplest fashion, being four separate flat conducting layers: upper dc conductor 707, internal conductor 708 to form a bidirectional switch and lower dc conductor 711, phase output conductor 710 and mid voltage conductor 709. phase output conductor 710 and mid voltage conductor 709. Within die structure 701, the die are stacked in the second variant of the common die position, comprising upper dc conductor 712, internal conductor 714 to form a bidirectional switch, lower dc conductor 716, phase output conductor 715 and mid voltage conductor 713. Figure 8A schematically depicts the pair of two die as a bidirectional switch with a common output of Figure 2F in more detail; Figure 8B schematically depicts the pair of two die according to an exemplary embodiment, as a mechanical representation (plan view); and Figure 8C schematically depicts the pair of two die, as alternative exemplary embodiments. Figure 8, comprising Figures 8A to 8C, schematically illustrates a pair of two die as a bidirectional switch with a common output. Die 303 and 304 have drains connected to connector 804 to form a bidirectional switch. Alternatively, both sources could be connected instead. Those skilled in the art would be able to make this modification to the structure. In this example, die 303 has source connected to conductor 803 and die 304 has source connected to conductor 805. Die 305 and 306 provide a second bidirectional switch, die 305 has source connected to the conductor 806 and die 306 has source connected to the conductor 805. In this example, die 304 and 306 are connected to a common conductor 805. Alternatively, die 304 and 306 may not share a common conductor. Figure 8B shows a plan view from the top of a common flat die structure 802 where the die are not stacked using the first variant of the common die positions. Figure 8C shows a side view stacked variant 801 which has the second variant of the die positions. Those skilled in the art will see how this configuration may be adapted to also use a structure similar to that shown in die structure 402 of Figure 4C. Within die structure 802, each die 303, 304, 305 and 306 is connected to the appropriate conduction in the simplest fashion, being four separate flat conducting layers: die 304 between conductors 810 and 809; die 303 between conductor 809 to form a bidirectional switch with die 304 and conductor 808; die 305 between conductors 811 and 812; and die 306 between conductor 812 to form a bidirectional switch with die 305 and conductor 808. Within die structure 801, the die are stacked in the second variant of the common die position: die 304 between conductor 813 and 814; die 303 between conductor 814 to form a bidirectional switch with die 304 and conductor 817; die 305 between conductors 815 and 816; and die 306 between conductor 816 to form a bidirectional switch with die 305 and conductor 817. Those skilled in the art will see how other topologies can be created adapting these methods. Those skilled in the art will see how the structure may contain any form of electrical or electronic component and how either power conductors, signal conductors or both can be provided in the same structure. The use of a common die location simplifies the design of the signal connections and placement of other components. Production using additive manufacturing. Figure 9 schematically illustrates an additive manufacturing process, in this example an ink jetting method. Ink jetting is an Additive Manufacturing process in which a binding liquid is selectively deposited to join powder material together to form a 3D part. An ink jetting procedure generally consist of the following steps, however, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other procedures exist: 1. The powder material is spread over the build platform 907 using a roller 903. 2. The print head 902 moves on an XY bar 901 and deposits the binder adhesive on top of the powder 906 where required. 3. The build platform 907 is lowered by the model's layer thickness 908. 4. Another layer of powder 906 is spread over the previous layer. The object is formed where the powder is bound to the liquid. 5. The unbound powder 906 remains in position surrounding the object 904. 6 The process is repeated until the entire object 904 has been made. 7. Un-dosed powder is removed. 8 The part is sintered. 35 In one embodiment, two inks are used. The use of these two inks in the creation of a structure may control that structure’s conductive or insulative properties. As an example, and those skilled in the art will be able to produce other examples, the powder may be copper with D10 of 20 um and D90 of 70 ym for reasons of making the powder spreadable. To create a conductive structure, a first ink is used as a binder, for example, copper formate tetrahydrate and includes stabilisers, for example, octylamine aminomethyl propanol AMP. For the highest level of conductively the ink saturates the powder, for example, two passes with 12 pl (picolitre) drops with a dots per inch (dpi) of 360. To create an insulator structure, a highly alkaline second ink solution is used which provides oxygen, for example, AlzO3 nanoparticles (preferably as small as possible to aid sintering of resistive layer at Cu sintering temperatures) suspended in liquid and/or yttrium butoxide and/or some other oxide forming butoxide. Oxidisation either takes place immediate or during subsequent heating steps. For the highest level of insulation, the ink saturates the powder, for example, two passes with a 12 pl drops with a dots per inch of 360. Software may be used to calculate the necessary dosage based on chemical analysis and processors or from experimental data. 20 To create a cooling channel, or a void, the powder is not dosed and thus becomes a support structure during printing. The un-dosed powder is then removed before sintering, for example, via an air jet. Additional material or fluid layers for example dielectrics, phase change materials or plastics, can be printed or sprayed as an additional ink. Alternatively, fluid may be inserted during pause in the additive manufacture as was described for the case of the power semiconductor die. Alternatively, the dielectric could be poured into a surface orifice and thus into a void created when the un-dosed powder was removed. The orifice would then be filled. 30 35 The die may be placed using the same xy bar as the ink jetting heads 902. In this case the Z axis may be controlled by the build plate height 908. This may be controlled via software. Additive manufacture could be used to create a section of the part before inserting one or more components on the last layer before, or after, that layer is sintered or consolidated. Components could be inserted on a green or brown part then build continues. The components insertion could be in a different machine or a function of the additive manufacture machine. Alternatively, a subassembly of component(s) (with structure below) is placed into additive manufacture build area before powder bed placed to surround and above. This subassembly could be manufactured using a range or manufacturing techniques.\n\nAlternatively, the additive manufacture may build on top of component(s).\n\nIncorporating thermal features Figure 10 schematically illustrates the incorporation of insulators (1004), fully encapsulating (except external connection areas) in this example. Drawing 1000 shows an insulating structure, 1004, which is in contact with the conductor structures, 1001, 1002 and 1003, and also the semiconductor die, 303, 304, 305, and 306. In the embodiment illustrated in drawing, the conductors, 1001, 1002 and 1003 emerge from the insulative structure. Those skilled in the art will see how other structures could be formed using this method and that the insulator structure may connect with the conductive structures only in certain areas. Multiple insulator structures may be present in the same part. The conductive structures and insulative structures may be manufactured as the same part or be separate parts brought together. Each structure may be manufactured using methods including additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing may include those listed before or the build-up of a stack of individual layers (laminations) for example a printed circuit board or a series of deposited material layers. The insulating structure, 1004, serves to protect the die and other items contained within it from environmental and physical stresses. Figure 11 schematically illustrates the incorporation of coolant fluid channels (1101) within the structure, cooling electrical conductors (1001, 1002 and 1003) and insulation structure (1004) in this example. Drawing 1100 shows an example fluid coolant circuit, 1101, with an inlet, 1102, and outlet, 1103. The coolant circuit, 1101, passes through the insulation structure, 1004, before passing within the electrical conductors, 1001. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the fluid channel could alternatively adjoin the conductor, particularly where the fluid is conductive. The fluid coolant circuit, 1101, passes through the insulation structure, 1004, near the semiconductor die, 304. Alternatively, the fluid could come in direct contact with the die using an adaptive structure. Drawing 1100 shows an example where the fluid coolant circuit, 1101, passes through all of the structures within the part. Those skilled in the art will be able to adapt this approach to other structural and electrical designs where the fluid coolant circuit flows through or adjoins, or both, some or all the structures. Figure 12 schematically depicts the primary current loops within a T-type topology under the three main switching states. Diagram element numbers are by reference to Figure 7A. Loop1 is when the bidirectional switch (made of two switches 304 and 303 and conductor 704 in the diagram) connected to the mid-voltage 703 (between the two capacitors) and the upper switch (306) are switching. Loop 2 is when the bidirectional switch (made of two switches in the diagram) connected to the mid-voltage 703 (between the two capacitors) and the lower switch (305) are switching. Loop 3 is during switching of the upper or lower switches, which are connected to the positive (310) and negative (311) dc supplies. Figure 13 schematically depicts how the 3D routing of the positive and negative dc conductors close to the mid-voltage conductor and bidirectional switch can be used to reduce the parasitic inductance. Diagram element numbers are by reference to Figure 7A. T-type configurations are extremely difficult to design using conventional technologies as there are multiple parallel plains which require careful routing to reduce the parasitic ac inductance during the three main switching events. However, the methods described herein enable the parasitic ac inductance to be reduced via the provided packaging. The positive (310) and negative (311) dc conductors close (i.e. proximal) to the mid-voltage conductor (703) and mid voltage bidirectional switch (304, 704, 303) can be used to reduce the parasitic inductance of all three loops described in Figure 12. Figure 14A schematically depicts a method according to an exemplary embodiment; and Figure 14B schematically depicts a method according to an exemplary embodiment. 35 In more detail, Figure 14A schematically depicts a method of packaging semiconductor die, particularly the half bridge configuration of Figure 2B and similar to the half bridge configuration of Figure 4D, showing layers A to |. Layer C is under the die and contains the three conductors (one of which connects to two die) ready for the die to be placed. Layer D has the die placed (onto the conductive areas) and a layer of powder placed and then inked (where needed). The die is surrounded (up to it upper face) by insulator. The two horizontal bars are parts of the conductors. The remainder is un-dosed powder. Layer E has powder spread which is dosed to produce conductors attached to the top fact of the die. The remaining layer area is either dosed insulator or un-dosed powder. In more detail, Figure 14B schematically depicts a method of packaging semiconductor die, particularly the T-Type three-level inverter phase configuration of Figure 2E and similar to the T- type three-level inverter phase configuration of Figure 7B, showing layers A to F. Layer C is under the die and contains the three conductors (one of which connects to two die) ready for the die to be placed. Layer D has the die placed (onto the conductive areas) and a layer of powder placed and then inked (where needed). The die is surrounded (up to it upper face) by insulator. The horizontal bar is part of the conductor. The remainder is un-dosed powder. Layer E has powder spread which is dosed to produce conductors attached to the top fact of the die.
