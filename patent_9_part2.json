There are two typical coolers. One is an air cooler, such as a heatsink with a fan, in which air is forced to flow through the heatsink to dissipate heat into ambient. The other is a liquid cooler, such as those based on a water block or cold plate, in which liquid is forced to flow through the cooler by a pump. A traditional water block comprises of a chamber with a base plate, wherein a circulating liquid such as water is forced by a pump to flow into the chamber from an inlet and out of the chamber from an outlet so as to take away heat from the base plate attached to a semiconductor chip package. It is noted that a thermal pathway in the heat dissipating processes includes: 1) a heat transferring process, where the heat generated by the semi- conductor chip package transfers to the base plate by a thermal conduction process, 2) a heat exchanging process, where the heat in the base plate transfers to the circulating liquid when it passes through the base plate, and 3) a heat dissipating process, where the heat is taken away from the chamber by the circulating liquid and dissipated to the ambient. Of the heat dissipating processes, the heat exchang- ing process between the base plate and the circulating liquid is critical. In prior arts, some methods have been developed to improve the heat exchange rate between the liquid and the base plate, such as adding a pattern of micro channels on the base plate. However, low heat exchange rate between the liquid and the base plate is still a bottleneck for liquid coolers when cooling a CPU or GPU with high power. To overcome this bottleneck, a 3D (3-dimensional) water block based on a heat pipe or vapor chamber structure is described in the present disclosure. Some preferred embodiments of the present disclosure include: 1) the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure of the 3D water block is a plurality of U-shaped heat pipes, 2) the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure of the 3D water block includes a vapor chamber as its bottom portion and a plurality of heat pipes as its top portion, in which the heat pipes are connected to the vapor chamber along its periph- eral edge, 3) the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure of the 3D water block includes a vapor chamber as its bottom ortion and a plurality of heat pipes as its top portion, which are connected to the vapor chamber at its top side, and 4) the eat pipe or vapor chamber structure of the 3D water block is a multiple connectivity of vapor chamber, including a orizontal vapor chamber and a plurality of vertical vapor chambers. The disclosure also describes a panel type of 3D water block for cooling a plurality of heat sources on a PCB (printed circuit board), comprising: a box including a base plate with a top surface and a bottom surface a 3D heat exchanger and a circulating liquid; wherein the bottom surface of the base plate is attached onto the plurality of heat sources through a thermal interface material, the 3D heat exchanger includes a vapor chamber structure attached with a plurality of fin layers, in which a plurality of channels form among the plurality of fin layers; wherein the vapor chamber structure includes a bottom vapor chamber as a portion of the base plate, and a plurality of vertical heat pipes or vapor chambers connected to a top side of the bottom vapor chamber; and wherein the circulating liquid flows through the plurality of channels for taking away heat generated by the heat source via the 3D heat exchanger to ambient.

The numerical symbol 1000 in FIG. 1 designates a cross-sectional view of a traditional water block 100 which is attached onto a heat source 130 through a thermal interface material 140. The water block 100 basi- cally includes a base plate 101 with some micro channels 103, a cover 102, an inlet 104 and an outlet 105. The 106 designates a seal or a bonding connection between the base plate 101 and the cover 102 for them to form a sealed chamber. The dashed arrows designated by the numerical symbols 131, 132, 133 and 134 are for illustrating a circu- lating liquid which flows into the water block 100 from the inlet 104, then passes through the top surface, including the micro channels 103, of the base plate 101 as shown by the dashed arrows from 132 to 133, and then flows out of the water block 100 from the outlet 105. The water block 100 is traditionally named because water is usually used as a circulating liquid; another traditional name for it is a cold plate, because cold liquid continuously passes through it in its application. The numerical symbol 1200 in FIG. 1A designates the base plate from its cross-sectional view 101 and from its top view 101a, in which the 132a and 133a designate the circulating liquid 132 and 133 as shown in FIG. 1, which flows through or passes the base plate 101/101a and the micro channels 103a. The numerical symbol 1500 in FIG. 1B is for illustrating the working mechanism of the water block 100, in which some arrows designated by the numerical symbols 150, 151, 152, 153 and 154 are added in contrast to FIG. 1 to illustrate a thermal pathway detailing how the heat generated by the heat source 130 is dissipated to ambient by the water block 100. The arrows 150 are for illustrating that the heat generated by the heat source 130 transfers to the base plate 101 via a thermal conduction process, the arrows 151 are for illustrating that the heat further spreads throughout the base plate 101, the arrows 152 and 153 are for illustrating the heat exchange between the base plate 101 and the circulating liquid 132/ 133 that takes place when the liquid passes the base plate 101, and the arrow 154 is for illustrating that the heat is taken out of the water block 100 by the circulating liquid 134 when it flows out from the outlet 105. It is noted that a heat exchange between the base plate 101 and the circulating liquid takes place at a top surface of the base plate 101 when the circulating liquid flows over or passes the top surface of the base plate 101 as shown by the arrows 132/133 in FIG. 1 or 132Â¢/133a in FIG. 1A. In other words, the circulating liquid with a lower temperature flows into the water block 100 from the inlet 104, then it is heated when it passes the base plate 101, and then the heated circulating liquid with a higher temperature flows out of the water block 100 from the outlet 105. It is further noted that the heat exchange between the base plate 101 and the circulating liquid only takes place at a top surface of the base plate 101, where some micro channels 103/103a as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 1A are usually added to enhance the heat exchange rate between them. It is also noted that the pattern of the micro channels 103/103a is not limited to the example shown in FIG. 1A, and that it can be designed to have various patterns to optimize the flowing path of the circu- lating liquid. However, regardless of any pattern of micro channels, the heat exchange rate in a traditional water block is limited to a low efficiency because the heat exchange only takes place on a top surface of the base plate 101/101a. Due to the fact that the heat exchange only takes place on a top surface of the base plate for a traditional water block, this prior art design will be called a 2D (2-dimensional) water block herein. In contrast, a 3D (3-dimensional) water block is disclosed in the present invention (which can also called a cold block in contrast to a traditional cold plate of prior arts), wherein a heat pipe or vapor chamber structure is introduced into the 3D water block so that a 3D heat exchange is achieved, which will be depicted in conjunction with drawings below. introduced into the 3D water block so that a 3D heat exchange is achieved, which will be depicted in conjunction with drawings below. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram for illustrating a 3D water block of one preferred embodiment of the present invention. The numerical symbol 2000 in FIG. 2 designates a cross- sectional view of a 3D water block 200 which is attached onto a heat source 130, such as a semiconductor package, through a thermal interface material 140, in which the numerical symbol 200 designates the 3D water block, com- prising: a box 201/202/203 including a base plate 201 and a cover 202/203 formed from a top piece 202 and a side wall 203, a 3D heat exchanger 210 which is enclosed inside the box 201/202/203, and a circulating liquid as illustrated by the dashed arrows 231/232/233/234. The numerical symbols 204 and 205 designate an inlet and an outlet of the box for the circulating liquid to flow into and out of the box, and the 206 designates a seal or a bonding connection between the base plate 201 and the cover 202/203 for them to form a sealed box. The 3D heat exchanger 210 includes a heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 and a plurality of fin layers 213 which is attached to the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 so as to form a plurality of channels among the plurality of fin layers. The heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 includes a bottom portion 211 and a top portion 212, wherein the bottom portion 211 is either attached to the top surface of the base plate 201 or combined with the base plate 201 as a portion of it, and the top portion 212 extends upwards from the base plate 201 and fills inside the box 201/202/203 to form a 3D structure. The circulating liquid 231/232/233/234 flows into the box from the inlet 204, then passes the 3D heat exchanger 210 from one side 221 to another side 222 between the 3D heat exchanger 210 and the side wall 203, and then flows out of the box from the outlet 205. When the circulating liquid 231/232/233/234 passes the 3D heat exchanger 210, or in other words it flows through the plurality of channels among the plurality of fin layers 213, it is heated by the 3D heat exchanger 210 and a heat exchange between the circulating liquid and the 3D heat exchanger 210 takes place. This is further depicted in conjunction with drawing in the follow- ing FIG. 2A. Finally, the arrow lines Al to Al, A2 to A2 and A3 to A3 designate some locations for some horizontal cross-sectional views of the 3D heat exchanger 210 to further display its structure in conjunction with drawings in FIG. 2B, FIG. 2C and FIG. 2D in the following. FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram for illustrating a thermal for the 3D heat 210 cool the heat FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram for illustrating a thermal pathway for the 3D heat exchanger 210 to cool the heat source 130, in which some arrows designated by the numeri- cal symbols 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255 and 256 are added in contrast to FIG, 2 to illustrate the thermal pathway of how the heat generated by the heat source 130 is taken to ambient by the 3D water block 200. The arrows 250 are for illus- trating that the heat generated by the heat source 130 transfers to the base plate 201 and the bottom portion 211 of the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 via a thermal conduction process, the arrows 251 and 252 are for illustrating heat spreading throughout the bottom portion 211 and up to the top portion 212 of the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 via a phase changing manner where a liquid inside the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 changes from a liquid state to a vapor state, the arrows 253 are for illustrating heat spreading from the top portion 212 to the plurality of fin layers 213, the arrows 254 and 255 are for illustrating a heat exchange between the 3D heat exchanger 210 and the circulating liquid 232/233 when it flows through the plurality of chan- nels among the plurality of fin layers 213, or in other words when it passes the 3D heat exchanger 210 as shown in FIG. 2 and in the following FIG. 2D, and the arrow 256 is for illustrating that the heat is taken out of the 3D water block 200 by the circulating liquid when it flows out of the box from the outlet 205 as shown in FIG. 2. It is noted that for the traditional water block 100 of prior arts, the heat generated by the heat source 130 transfers to the circulating liquid only from the top surface of its base plate 101 as shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B. In contrast, for the 3D water block 200 of present invention, the heat generated by the heat source 130 transfers to the circulating liquid from a 3D heat exchanger 210, including the plurality of fin layers 213, the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 as well as the top surface of the base plate 201, as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 2A. According to their different heat transferring methods, the present water block and the traditional water block are respectively called a 3D water block and a 2D water block herein. It is also noted that the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure 211/212 can quickly transfer heat from its bottom portion 211 to its top portion 212 via a phase change liquid enclosed inside the heat pipe or vapor chamber structure. When this liquid is heated at the bottom portion 211, it changes from a liquid to a vapour, and rises to fill the top portion 212. The heat then spreads from the top portion 212 to the plurality of fin layers 213, where it is then transferred to and taken away by the circulating liquid. This cools the phase change liquid, causing it to change back to liquid and flow back to the bottom portion 211 via a capillary action, completing the cycle. Through this method, the original 2D heat dissipation surface is effectively changed to a 3D heat dissipation structure, thus achieving a high heat exchange rate between the circulating liquid and the 3D heat exchanger by massively increasing the surface area between the two. FIG. 2B, FIG. 2C and FIG. 2D are schematic diagrams for further illustrating the structure of the 3D water block 200 as shown in FIG. 2. The numerical symbol 2200 in FIG. 2B designates a cross-sectional top view of the 3D water block 200 from the cross-sectional location Al to Al as marked in FIG. 2, in which the 201a designates the cross-sectional top view of the base plate 201, the 206a designates the cross- sectional top view of the seal or the bonding connection 206, the 211a designates the top view of the bottom portion 211, and the 212a designates the cross-sectional top view of the top portion 212 as shown in FIG. 2.
