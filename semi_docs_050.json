As a result, tubing and various fittings made of fluorocarbon materials (which are chemically resistant to these fluids) are used to transport those fluids. It is important to control the testing process when evaluating various fitting designs, so that accurate comparisons of the sealing capabilities of tube fitting connections can be made. 4.2 It is the intent of this method t o provide a procedure which evaluates the sealing capability of the tube fitting connection when subjected to a change in ambient temperature. 4.3 The results obtained when usin g this method are applicable only to conditions that specifically duplicate the procedures used within this method. 4.4 When using this test method, i t is assumed that the test specimens are truly representative of the material and manufacturing process specified for that product.

    "content": "6.1.1   Manual equipment without automation is adequate if it includes an ASO plus excess flow device. (Where required, per UFC articles 51 and 80.) Automated purging is generally more efficient than manual purging and is, therefore, recommended. The ASO function is achieved if the ASO valve automatically defaults to a closed position via a pneumatically actuated valve, or separate actuator that will close a manual cylinder valve. Either method should be fail-safe (default to a closed position on loss of power and/or pneumatics). This could also be initiated by any number of abnormal circumstances.  \n6.1.2   Fully Automatic — This is a broad category of designs using any number of transducers, remotely operated valves, and logic to accomplish safeguarding, monitoring, and automatic purging. Extension of this approach to central data collection, analysis, and reporting via computers and special programs offers the capability of further reducing hazards and enhancing safety."

The appropriate regulatory agency has designated one or more connections for each product gas.  \n6.2.2  Other containers for liquid or low vapor pressure materials may require the connection of two fittings. One of these is used to admit gas, which either pressurizes the product, allowing liquid withdrawal, or absorbs the product, allowing withdrawal of a gasphase mixture of the product and the gas. The other fitting is used for withdrawal. The types and labeling of the connections vary among suppliers.  \n6.2.3  High Pressure Pigtail — A semi-flexible assembly of piping, subjected to cylinder pressure, which is used to connect the cylinder to the rigidly mounted components on the panel. The intent of this flexible assembly is to accommodate the location of the cylinder outlet.  \n6.2.4  No Pigtail — An alternate acceptable method allows cylinders to be elevated or lowered to match the fixed height of the connection point on fixed panel equipment."

A check valve should be installed in each line connecting the purge gas to the process panel equipment. 6.3.2 Process Gas Cylinder Contamination by Purge Gas — The purpose of purging is to remove air or residual process gas from the panel equipment (or part of it) back to the internal cavity of the closed cylinder valve. WARNING: Check valves are not acceptable in this part of the process gas system because purging would be defeated. Cross contamination can only be prevented by safeguards which assure complete cylinder valve closure and process gas venting, before purging begins. 6.4 Materials — All materials furnished should be manufactured to nationally recognized standards.

Dead end legs should be eliminated or kept to a minimum volume and length.  \n6.8   Maintainability — Planned maintenance or forced repair is facilitated or inhibited by specific design concepts and features.

If a pressure sensor is located between the ASO and the cylinder valve, as depicted in Figure 1, it should also have a working pressure at least 1.1 times the product cylinder pressure. 7.1.2 Pressure Reduction — Gases are most commonly required at POU at less than 100 psig. Cylinder pressure is reduced to the lower pressure by a gas pressure regulator, when necessary. 7.1.3 Excess Pressure Control — Provisions should be made to protect the distribution piping and process equipment from excessive pressure. This protection may include a pressure transducer, pressure switch, or indicating transmitter connected to close the ASO, a relief valve piped into the exhaust, or a redundant pressure regulator with primary regulator failure indication. 7.1.4 Cylinder Contents — The product remaining in the cylinder is"

This can be either a gauge or transducer readout. 7.1.6 Filters — Particles from ambient sources, entering with the product or generated by the system elements, can be captured by including one or more filters at a variety of locations within the system. This practice tends to protect the components and the process. 7.1.7 Purge Gas Connection — A purge gas connection is provided via a branched connection to admit clean, dry, inert purge gas through an on-off valve. This is commonly located between the cylinder connection and high pressure isolation valve in the panel system. Gas purging is used for installation of a new system, before disconnecting a spent cylinder, after connecting a fresh cylinder, and for removal of equipment for maintenance purposes."

Under special circumstances, they are used to reduce pressure in the equipment and/or transfer product. One or more vents may be used at various locations, and downstream venting may be either atmospheric pressure or vacuum from a venturi or pump. Vacuum venting is strongly recommended. 7.1.9 High Pressure Indication — A pressure indicator in common with the high pressure line connected to the cylinder valve is required to indicate the presence of residual process gas, or an open or leaking cylinder or panel valve. It also shows application of adequate purge gas pressure, and, in cases where vacuum-assisted purging is employed, an indication of the vacuum level should be included. 7.1.10 Cylinder Connection Makeup — After a fresh cylinder has been connected, the integrity of the cylinder valve connection can be tested with the use of the pressure indicator mentioned in Section 7.1.9."

Thus, test data obtained by means of this test method apply only to the local exhaust conditions that existed within the enclosure during the testing. Extrapolation of the test data to other exhaust operating conditions is not usually possible.  \n3.2  Use of this test method requires knowledge of the principles of gas analysis as well as flow and pressure measurement, gas chromatographic instrumentation, and gas sampling techniques.  \n3.3  An acceptable enclosure, as determined in Section 7.1, does not imply a safe condition for routine equipment operation with a leak and/or a tubing/fitting failure.  An acceptable enclosure is one that will contain potential worst case leaks in an emergency, non-routine situation.  The fact that an enclosure is acceptable does not imply that the enclosure is safe to operate when a hazardous gas leak has been detected."

    "content": "6.1  A test is performed by releasing tracer gas at a constant flow rate within an enclosure to simulate a worst case leak and then measuring on the periphery of the enclosure for the presence or absence of tracer.  The lack of measurable tracer indicates that the release of potentially hazardous gases or vapors within the enclosure at the tracer injection point(s) will not result in their migration to the outside of the enclosure.  Gas samples are taken by means of disposable syringes, sample bags, or sample vials.  Gas samples are analyzed by means of electron capture gas chromatography."
