Cell spacing shall be either 125 or $1 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (see Table 2, and Figures 1 and 2).  \n6.1.2  Dot Size — The nominal shape of the dot produced in the matrix may be circular or square. Its dia-meter or edge length (after polishing) shall be $1 0 0 \\pm$ $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .\n\nSEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.2  Border Rows and Columns (see Figure 3)\n\n6.2.1  One border row and one border column shall contain a dot in each cell. These are identified as the primary border row and the primary border column. These are used by the code reader to determine the reference point and orientation of the matrix.  \n6.2.2  The opposing (secondary) border row and column shall contain dots in alternating cells.  \n6.2.3  The reference point of the symbol shall be the physical centerpoint of the cell common to the primary border row and the secondary border column.  \n6.2.4  The maximum dot misalignment within a cell is $2 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . This ensures that a minimum size dot covers a cell central area of radius $2 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (see Figure 4).  \nTable 1  Matrix Code Symbol Dimensions  \n#1:  See Figure 1 for pictorial representation of Dimensions $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ , $\\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ , ${ \\bf R } _ { 1 }$ , and ${ \\bf R } _ { 2 }$ .\n\nSEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.3  Content of the Matrix Code Symbol (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.3  Content of the Matrix Code Symbol\n\nContent: 6.3.1 Each square matrix code symbol shall contain between 10 and 23 message characters encoded in accordance with AIM ISS Data Matrix, including the characters associated with error checking and correcting (ECC200), as also defined in AIM ISS Data Matrix. 6.3.2 The message characters may include any of those designated as “mostly uppercase” in Table 5 and Annex J of AIM ISS - Data Matrix. The first 10 message characters shall contain two elements: • a vendor-assigned 8-character wafer identification code, followed by • a 2-character vendor identification code as defined in SEMI AUX001. 6.3.2.1 The remaining message characters, if any, shall contain information as agreed between the vendor and user. 6.3.3 The total number of message characters available depends on the row/column count and on the encoded character set (see Table 2). 6.4 Location of the Matrix Code Symbol 6.4.1 With the wafer positioned front surface up and with the primary fiducial toward the operator,\n\nSEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.3  Content of the Matrix Code Symbol (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.3  Content of the Matrix Code Symbol\n\nContent: the reference point of the matrix code symbol shall be located as specified in Table 3. 6.4.2 The square matrix code symbol used on 125 to $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ diameter wafers shall be oriented with the border columns parallel with the primary fiducial bisector and the border rows perpendicular to the primary fiducial bisector. The secondary border column shall be toward the primary fiducial bisector, and the primary border row shall be toward the edge of the wafer. 6.4.3 The nominal position of the reference point of the matrix code symbol is $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ to the right of the closest alphanumeric code field. A $3 ^ { \\circ }$ skew toward the alphanumeric field, which is the maximum skew allowed by SEMI M12 and SEMI M13, does not cause the matrix code symbol to impinge on the alphanumeric code fields, even if the symbol is placed only $1 5 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the primary fiducial bi-sector. Consequently, this matrix code symbol position\n\nSEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.3  Content of the Matrix Code Symbol (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # 6.3  Content of the Matrix Code Symbol\n\nContent: permits the simultaneous use of front surface alphanumeric marking as specified in SEMI M12 or M13, on 125 to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ wafers with either flatted or notched primary fiducials. 6.4.4 Because the matrix code symbol is located in the same place with respect to the primary fiducial bisector on all wafer diameters from 125 to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , the use of both marking and reading equipment is simplified. 6.4.5 The distance from the edge of the data matrix code symbol to the diameter perpendicular to the primary fiducial bisector varies according to the actual size of the wafer and the placement of the symbol within its tolerance range. Minimum distances from the edge of the code symbol to the wafer center-line are given in Table 4 for both $1 6 \\times 1 6$ , $1 2 5 { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and $2 0 \\times 2 0$ , $1 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ matrix code symbols.

A1-1 The relative positions of alphanumeric and data matrix markings are shown in Figure A1-1. This figure also shows the relationship between the data matrix code symbol and the edge of the polished area of the front surface of the wafer. Wafer peripheries in the figure are the edges of the polished area of wafers with maximum intrusion of the edge contour, minimum diameter, and maximum flat diameter (minimum flat length), or distance between the notch pin centerline and the wafer edge, as specified in SEMI M1. For all wafer diameters, SEMI M1 allows the edge contour to extend inward from the edge up to $5 0 8 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ (Dimension B in Figure 4 of SEMI M1). The distance between the notch pin centerline and the wafer periphery may vary from 0.30 to $0 . 8 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ as indicated in Figure\n\nSEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # APPENDIX 1 SIMULTANEOUS MARKING WITH SQUARE DATA MATRIX AND ALPHANUMERIC CODES (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI T2-0298 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR MARKING OF WAFERS WITH A TWODIMENSIONAL MATRIX CODE SYMBOL - # APPENDIX 1 SIMULTANEOUS MARKING WITH SQUARE DATA MATRIX AND ALPHANUMERIC CODES\n\nContent: 6 of SEMI M1. Other dimensions and tolerances are specified in the appropriate polished wafer specification in SEMI M1.

Note that alphanumeric code field locations are not specified for $1 2 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter notched wafers in either SEMI M12 or SEMI M13. A1-3 The nominal position of the reference point of the data matrix code symbol is marked by a $+$ ; this position is 1 mm to the right of the closest alphanumeric code field. Because of the tolerances on the position of the reference point, the largest data matrix code symbol $2 0 \\times 2 0$ , $1 5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ cell spacing) may lie anywhere within the dotted square.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on November 27, 2001.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2002; to be published March 2002.  \nNOTE: This document was entirely rewritten for publication in 2002.\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 This specification provides a common format, content, size, and location for printed, machinereadable labels on wafer boxes to facilitate communication of data essential for advanced traceability and electronic data exchange systems. These labels differ from those used in common commercial practice in that they provide less detailed information about parametric properties of the wafer. Such information is now readily stored in advanced traceability systems. 1.2 This specification covers labels that contain two bar code symbols and their associated human-readable interpretation. 1.3 This specification also covers a two-dimensional Data Matrix code symbol that can accommodate substantially more information than can the bar code symbols. This symbol is included to provide for a smooth transition from existing traceability and labeling procedures to the comprehensive, unified system envisioned for the future in which common reading equipment can be used throughout the plant. If the Data Matrix symbol is used without the bar code symbols, provision is\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: made for an associated human readable interpretation. 1.4 Labels provided in accordance with this specification satisfy the special requirements of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ Wafer Shipping Systems, detailed in SEMI M45, for both front opening shipping box (FOSB) labels and bag labels.\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This specification covers size, message content and symbology requirements of labels for wafer boxes used for storage and transport of silicon wafers $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ in diameter and larger. 2.2 For wafer boxes used with 100 to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter wafers, this specification provides for two similar labels in order that the contents of the wafer box can be identified when the wafer box is stored in either of two positions: with the side of the wafer box parallel with the front of the storage shelf or with the end of the wafer box parallel with the front of the storage shelf. Because wafer boxes are routinely stacked for storage, placement of box labels on the top or bottom of the box is not recommended. 2.3 For FOSBs used with $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ wafers, this specification provides for two identical labels, one to be placed on the FOSB and the other to be placed on the outer bag. These requirements are consistent with the requirements of SEMI M45. SEMI M31 specifies FOSB dimensions. 2.4 The message content and locations\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: of the symbols used on the labels covered by this specification are designed to fit in a space consistent with size of the available flat area on wafer boxes investigated. If a larger flat area is available on the wafer boxes to be used, the label size may be increased and additional message content included. 2.5 This specification includes descriptions of the characteristics of the code formats to be employed. 2.6 The labels covered by this specification may be applied on the box itself, and on the box wrap portion of the wafer package, but not on the transport package (outer shipping carton) used for commercial transportation of wafer packages. NOTE 1: Specifications for transaction labels, which are intended for use on the outer shipping carton, are given in ANSI/EIA 556-B. 2.6.1 The format of the barcode is based on Code 39, as specified in ISO/IEC 16388. 2.6.2 The format of the Data Matrix Code is specified in ISO/IEC 16022. 2.7 Wafer box labels are intended to be applied in a cleanroom environment concurrent with the completion of production of the\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: wafers. Although it is recognized that the materials of construction and the adhesives used to apply the label must be selected with this use in mind, their specification is beyond the scope of this document. 2.8 The dimensions in this specification are applicable to labels printed with printers that have nominal resolution of 203 dots per inch (dpi). Printers with higher resolution may be used, but many of the dimensions may differ from those in this specification and the code fields may or may not fit within the specified label size and format. In such cases, the user of this specification must ensure that the label is of a size that fits the box to be employed. 2.9 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 3.1  SEMI Standards\n\nAUX1 — List of Vendor Identification Codes  \nSEMI M1.15 — Standard for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers (Notched)  \nSEMI M12 — Specification for Serial Alphanumeric Marking of the Front Surface of Wafers  \nSEMI M13 — Specification for Alphanumeric Marking of Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI M31 — Provisional Specification for FrontOpening Shipping Box Used to Transport and Ship 300 mm Wafers  \nSEMI M45 — Provisional Standard for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ Wafer Shipping System  \nSEMI T1 — Specification for Back Surface Bar Code Marking of Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI T2 — Specification for Marking of Wafers with a Two-Dimensional Matrix Code Symbol  \nSEMI T7 — Specification for Back-surface Marking of Double-side Polished Wafers with a Two-dimensional Data Matrix Code Symbol  \n3.2  ANSI Standards1  \nANSI/ASC X3.182 — Bar Code Print Quality - Guideline  \nANSI MH10.8.2 — Data Application Identifier Standard  \n3.3  EIA Standards2  \nANSI/EIA-556-B  — Outer Shipping Container Label Standard  \nANSI/EIA 706 — Component Marking Standard\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 3.4  ISO/IEC Standards3\n\nISO/IEC 15417 — Automatic Identification and Data Capture Technique Symbology Specification – Code 128  \nISO/IEC 16022 International Symoblogy Specification – Data Matrix  \nISO/IEC  16388 — Automatic Identification and Data Capture Technique Symbology Specification –  Code 39\n\nSEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 4  Terminology (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI T3-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR WAFER BOX LABELS - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: 4.1 Definitions of terms relating to wafer boxes (see Figure 1) are as follows: 4.1.1 bar end, of a wafer box base — the end of the box base that is next to the first pocket of the cassette inside the base or the first pocket of the base itself. 4.1.2 base, of a wafer box — the open-top container into which wafers are placed, either in cassettes or into integrally molded pockets. 4.1.3 box wrap — the wrapping or bagging applied over the wafer box to comprise the product package.

A4-1.2 The transmission, in the ASC X12 format, is comprised of an outer envelope (transmission envelope) which identifies the sender and receiver. Within the transmission envelope are one or more functional groups. A4-1.3 The functional groups are analogous to batches of like documents (i.e., certificate of analysis, test results, statistical results). Each functional group contains one or more transaction sets (electronic documents). Each transaction set is an ordered collection of segments. Each segment is an ordered collection of data elements. A4-1.4 Each segment has been assigned a two or three charac-ter identifier. A4-1.5 This identifier marks the beginning of each segment. Each element within the segment is separated by a data element separator character.\n\nSEMI T6-0697 (Reapproved 1104) PROCEDURE AND FORMAT FOR REPORTING OF TEST RESULTS BY ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI) - # A4-1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI T6-0697 (Reapproved 1104) PROCEDURE AND FORMAT FOR REPORTING OF TEST RESULTS BY ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI) - # A4-1  Introduction\n\nContent: Electronic Industry Data Exchange (EIDX) recommends the use of the asterisk $( ^ { * } )$ character as a data element separator.
