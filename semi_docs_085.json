NOTE 23: As the corner shape is expected not to be decisive for its printability (at least for an isolated corner), but rather the balance between area gain and loss, it is recommended to use area difference for corner qualification rather than area deviation. NOTE 24: Certain features with non-isolated corners, such as line-ends and contacts, have specific definitions listed in Sections 8.2.4 and beyond. 8.2.3.6 In present practice, corner rounding quantification is done without comparison to the nominal corner. However, this is only valid if the corner is isolated, non-corrected, and its area gain is negligible. Typically it is done based on the determination of a reference corner which is obtained by the extrapolation of the linear sections of the corner, if present (Figure 13). 8.2.3.7 equivalent corner rounding radius (ECRR) — an equivalent, effective corner rounding radius"
