R3-1 In addition to random errors, there are a number of sources of systematic error which can be identified but which cannot be estimated here; their estimation must be done by the individual laboratory. R3-2 Calibration Specimen Nonuniformity — The four-point probe method for measuring the resistivity of the calibration specimens responds to the average resistivity of a specimen over an area which is several times the total spacing of the four-point probe. Within this area there may be significant variation of resistivity. Spreading resistance measurements respond to the local resistivity of the calibration specimens.

    "content": "Title: SEMI MF657-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING WARP AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY NONCONTACT SCANNING - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method covers a noncontacting, nondestructive procedure to determine the warp and total thickness variation (TTV) of clean, dry silicon wafers in a free (unclamped) condition. The procedure uses a three-point back surface reference plane for determining warp. 2.2 The test method is applicable to circular silicon wafers from $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (or 2.0 in.) to $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ in diameter, and $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (or 0.004 in. approximately) and larger in thickness, independent of thickness variation and surface finish. The test method is applicable to wafers of semiconductors other than silicon with these same physical characteristics. 2.3 This test method is not intended to measure surface flatness; warp, which is not to be confused with flatness, is a bulk property of the wafer. Warp may be caused by unequal stresses on the two exposed surfaces of the wafer. It cannot be determined from measurements on a single exposed surface. The median surface"

Any values observed while in an over-range condition are invalid. 3.3 This test method does not completely separate thickness variation from warp. In some cases, the median surface may be flat but still show a non-zero value for warp. 3.4 Running probes off the test specimen during the scan sequence gives false readings. 3.5 Any change in the reference plane during scanning produces error in the indicated measurement equal to the axial vector value of the deviation at the probe axes at the points of largest and smallest differences. If such changes occur, there is the possibility that an incorrect location may be identified"

Spreading resistance measurements are used to measure resistivity variations in raw silicon crystals and completed semiconductor devices.  The reproducibility of spreading resistance measurements on silicon specimens is known to depend on the manner of specimen preparation.  The interpretation of spreading resistance measurements depends in turn on the reproducibility of test specimen measurements and on the reproducibility of calibration specimen measurements.  \n1.2  The procedures given are intended to confer a high degree of reproducibility to spreading resistance measurements, and offer improvement over other preparation techniques.1"

NOTE 1: Benefits derived from diamond polishing are (1) stability and reproducibility of spreading resistance values on large area or beveled specimens, and (2) acuity of beveled surface geometry. The benefits of stability and reproducibility are likely to apply to both conductivity types and all resistivity values; however, they have been demonstrated extensively only for (111) $n$ - type above $1 \\Omega { \\cdot } \\mathrm { c m }$ . Enhanced bevel acuity is independent of conductivity-type or resistivity value. 2.2 Separate practices are given for preparation of large-area specimens for measurement of lateral resistivity variations and for preparation of bevel-sectioned specimens (usually small chips) for measurement of vertical variations of resistivity (depth profiling). 2.3 The two practices are covered as follows: Front-Surface Diamond"

Nevertheless, such uniform damage is compatible with spreading resistance measurement data having very low scatter.  Contamination of the polishing medium with hard foreign particles can cause random heavy scratch damage to a specimen.  If encountered by the spreading resistance probes, heavily scratch-damaged regions may yield erratic measurement results.  \n3.2  Contamination of the specimen with water subsequent to polishing may adversely affect the reproducibility of spreading resistance measurements."

NOTE 3: The predominant causes of variation in the surface finish of the silicon specimen are expected to result from (1) the uniformity of particle size in the diamond grit, (2) the inclusion of a large fraction of needle-shaped grains (fines) in addition to the preferred symmetric grains (blocky diamond), and (3) in the case of diamond suspended in paste, the uniformity of the diamond distribution in the paste. For a fixed diamond grain size, whether the diamond is natural, single-crystal synthetic, or polycrystalline synthetic should make little difference in the resulting surface finish.

It may also make it difficult to determine whether the wafer edge profile lies within the permitted zone at point B of the template (see Figure 1). These difficulties can be overcome by aligning a straight edge to the wafer surface by direct contact, observing the shadow extension in the sharply focused region, and extrapolating the straight line edge of the template reference.

    "content": "1.1  The orientation of flats on silicon wafers is an important materials acceptance requirement.  The flats are used in semiconductor device processing to provide consistent alignment of device geometries with respect to crystallographic planes and directions.  \n1.2  The orientation of a wafer flat is the orientation of the surface of the flat (on the edge of the wafer).  Flats are usually specified with respect to a low-index plane, such as a (110) plane.  In such cases the orientation of the flat may be described in terms of its angular deviation from the low-index plane.  \n1.3  This standard covers two test methods for determining flat orientation.  \n1.4  Either one of these test methods is appropriate for process development and quality assurance applications. Until the interlaboratory precision of these test methods has been determined, it is not recommended that they be used between supplier and customer unless correlation studies are completed satisfactorily."

Although it is simpler and more rapid, it does not have the precision of Test Method A because it uses less precise and less expensive fixturing and equipment. It produces a permanent film record of the test.

    "content": "3.1  The alignment of the flat against the reference fence may be affected by the straightness of the flat.  In the unlikely event that the flat profile is convex, the flat orientation may not be unique.  More often the flat surface will touch the reference fence along two lines perpendicular to the wafer surface at two points.  In this case, the orientation determined is that of the plane through the two lines on the plane perpendicular to the wafer surface that passes through the two points.  In the latter cases, the orientation determined is that which is obtained in subsequent processing of the wafer when the alignment is between the flat and a reference fence.  \n3.2  Misalignment of the various fixtures degrades both the interlaboratory reproducibility and the absolute accuracy of both test methods.  The single-instrument repeatability is not degraded provided the fixturing is rigid."

To the extent that this is true, it becomes important that the oxygen be uniformly distributed over the entire slice. 1.2 Multiple test plans are included to satisfy a variety of requirements. The characteristic shape and magnitude of oxygen concentration distributions in crystals are functions of the crystal growth process. Although the specified test plans are intended to cover oxygen concentration distributions which are typically found, other distributions may occur. In such cases, it may be necessary to use test positions other than those specified in order to adequately describe the distribution pattern. 1.3 This test method may be used for process control, research and development, and materials acceptance purposes.

Under these conditions, great care must be taken to align the image of the notch correctly against the appropriate portions of the template."

    "content": "5.1  The wafer is aligned in position on an optical comparator and the image of the notch is compared with a series of templates projected on the screen of the comparator.  \n5.2  First, the wafer is aligned so that the sides of the image of the notch contact the image of the alignment pin for fixing the position of the wafer in use.  In this case, the image of the notch bottom must lie on or below the designated line on the notch form/depth template and the image of the wafer edge must lie on or above another designated line on the template.  \n5.3  The wafer is then aligned so that the image of the wafer edge coincides with the wafer periphery line on the template.  In this case, the image of the notch bottom must lie between maximum and minimum lines on the template.  \n5.4  The image of the notch sides are compared with a series of angles on the notch angle template and the angle that makes the best fit is chosen as the value of the notch angle."

The fixture must provide means for positioning the wafer such that the plane of the surface of the wafer is perpendicular to the viewing direction and that the wafer can be rotated about its center. The horizontal and vertical motions are parallel or perpendicular to the diameter of the wafer that passes through the notch. 6.3 Templates — having lines which define the limits of the notch dimensions. Two templates are required. 6.3.1 The notch form and depth template has two sections that define (1) the locations of the notch bottom and wafer periphery relative to the center of the alignment pin, and (2) the location of the notch bottom relative to the wafer periphery. Separate templates are required for each wafer diameter to be tested. An example of a notch"
