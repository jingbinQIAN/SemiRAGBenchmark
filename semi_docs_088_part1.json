This test method deals only with junction-to-case measurements of thermal resistance and limits itself to fluid bath testing environments. For this test, conduction through the leads is minimized, thus providing information on the ability of the plastic package material to dissipate heat. Due to the thermophysical properties of the heat transfer fluids used and the effects of the variable nature of the fluidstirring and package-mounting procedures, this test method should only be used for comparing the thermal characteristics of plastic packages in the same fluid bath system.\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 2.1  SEMI Specification\n\nSEMI G32 — Guideline for Unencapsulated Thermal Test Chip\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 3  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 3  Definitions\n\nContent: The following definitions and symbols shall apply for the purpose of this test: case temperature, $T _ { C }$ — in degrees Celsius. The case temperature is the temperature at a specified accessible reference point on the package in which the microelectronic chip is mounted. junction temperature, $T _ { J }$ — in degrees Celsius. The term is used to denote the temperature of the semiconductor junction in the microcircuit in which the major part of the heat is generated. For purposes of this test, the measured junction temperature is only indicative of the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the element used to sense the temperature. power dissipation, $P _ { H }$ — in watts, is the heating power applied to the device causing a junction-to-reference point temperature difference. thermal resistance, junction to specified reference point, $R _ { \\theta J R }$ — in degrees Celsius/watt.

The wire size shall be no larger than AWG size 30. The junction of the thermocouple shall be welded to form a bead rather than soldered or twisted. The accuracy of the thermocouple and associated measuring system shall be $\\pm 0 . 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . b. Suitable electrical equipment as required to provide controlled levels of conditioning power and to make the specified measurements.

A typical temperature-controlled fluid bath assembly is presented for illustrative purposes only. 4.1 Fluid Bath Assembly — A typi cal temperaturecontrolled fluid bath for thermally characterizing the microelectronic device under test is shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the package is mounted in a fluid bath separate from the fluid circulator, although it can be immersed directly in an integrated fluid circulator/bath unit. The fluid in the bath should be continuously stirred or agitated to ensure the required temperature stability and uniformity. Since this working fluid is being used as an infinite heat-sink, the case-to-fluid (ambient) temperature difference at the case temperature reference point of interest should be minimized, i.e., $\\leq 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .

The case-to-fluid temperature difference can be minimized by increasing the fluid velocity and by decreasing the power density seen by the fluid. The device under test should be mounted such that heat transfer to the fluid is not impeded. For leaded devices, the leads should be oriented in such a manner so as not to interfere with the heat transfer to the fluid and provide freedom to any thermal currents caused by the power dissipation within the package. The microcircuit package shall be mounted such that conduction cooling through the leads or test socket or both shall be small compared to the other cooling mechanisms. To minimize conduction through the leads, a special socket jig that connects No. 36 AWG wire to the device socket should be used.

This reference point location is determined with the device operating in free air and with no external heat-sinking. In general, this reference point is found to be on the surface of the body of the package, or on a lead near the body, in the major path of heat flow from the chip heating surface to the ambient fluid. The package surface may be altered to facilitate this measurement provided that such alteration does not affect the original heat transfer paths and, hence, the thermal resistance, within the package by more than a few percent. 5.1.1 Case Temperature, $T _ { c }$ — The microelectronic device under test shall be mounted under\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5  Procedure\n\nContent: specified conditions so that the case temperature can be held at the specified value. A thermocouple shall be attached on the surface of the device package directly under the chip (i.e., on the base plane of the package). A conducting epoxy may be used for this purpose. The thermocouple bead should be in direct mechanical contact with the package of the microelectronic device under test. Care should be taken to minimize exposure of the thermocouple bead to the high temperature gradient in the fluid film boundary layer at the packagefluid interface. If it is found that attaching the thermocouple directly to the case is impractical, an alternate approach using a thermocouple welded to one side of a thin metal disk should be used. This can be accomplished by parallel gap welding the crossed thermocouple wires to one side of a $0 . 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ (0.094 in) diameter, $0 . 0 2 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ (0.008 in) thick beryllium-copper disk\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5  Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5  Procedure\n\nContent: and then, with a thin layer of adhesive, bonding the other side of the disk to the case at the point of interest. The exposed thermocouple bead/wire on the disk shall be covered with epoxy or silicone rubber. The attached thermocouple should not unduly interfere with heat transfer to the fluid.\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR\n\nContent: 5.2.1 General Considerations — The thermal resistance of a semiconductor device is a measure of the ability of its carrier or package and mounting technique to provide for heat removal from the semiconductor junction. The thermal resistance of a microelectronic device can be calculated when the case temperature and power dissipation in the device and a measurement of the junction temperature are known. When making the indicated measurements, the package shall be considered to have achieved thermal equilibrium when halving the time between the application of power and the taking of the reading causes no error in the indicated results within the required accuracy of measurement. 5.2.2 Indirect Measurement of Junction Temperature for the Determination of $R _ { \\Theta J R }$ — The purpose of the test is to measure the thermal resistance of integrated circuits by using particular\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR\n\nContent: semiconductor elements on the chip to indicate the device junction temperature. In order to obtain a realistic estimate of the operating junction temperature, the whole chip in the package should be powered in order to provide the proper internal temperature distribution. During measurement of the junction temperature, the chip heating power (constant voltage source) shall remain constant while the junction calibration current remains stable. It is assumed that the calibration current will not be affected by the circuit operation during the application of heating power. The temperature-sensitive device parameter is used as an indicator of an average (weighted) junction temperature of the semiconductor element for calculations of thermal resistance. The measured junction temperature is indicative of the temperature only in the immediate vicinity of the element used to sense the\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR\n\nContent: temperature. The temperature-sensitive electrical parameters generally used to indirectly measure the junction temperature are the forward voltage of diodes and the emitter-base voltage of bipolar transistors. Other appropriate temperature-sensitive parameters may be used for indirectly measuring junction temperature for fabrication technologies that do not lend themselves to sensing the active junction voltages. 5.2.2.1 Steady-State Technique for Measuring $T _ { J } -$ The following symbols shall apply for the purpose of these measurements: $I _ { M }$ — ring current in milliamperes. $V _ { M H }$ — Value of temperature-sensitive parameters in millivolts, measured at $\\mathrm { \\Delta I _ { M } }$ , and corresponding to the temperature of the junction heated by $\\mathrm { P _ { H } }$ . $T _ { M C }$ — Calibration temperature in degrees Celsius, measured at the reference point. $V\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 5.2  Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Specified Reference Point, RθJR\n\nContent: _ { M C }$ — Value of temperature-sensitive parameter in millivolts, measured at $\\mathrm { I _ { M } }$ and specific value of $\\mathrm { T _ { M C } }$ . The measurement of $\\mathrm { T _ { J } }$ using junction forward voltage as the TSP is made in the following manner: Step 1 — Measurement of the temperature coefficient of the TSP (calibration). The coefficient of the temperature-sensitive parameter is generated by measuring the TSP as a function of the reference point temperature, for a specified constant measuring current, $\\mathrm { { I _ { M } } }$ , by externally heating the device under test in an oven or in a fluid bath. The reference point temperature range used during calibration shall encompass the temperature range encountered in the power application test (see Step 2).

This test is not a valid method for predicting the flashing performance in all mold types. It is a method for comparing flash tendency and flashing type of different molding compounds when evaluated under a specific set of molding process parameters.  \n2.2  Flashing presents problems wi th subsequent processing of plastic packaged devices after molding. A high flashing tendency increases die wear in the trim and form operation, may interfere with plating or solder dip finishing operations, and may prevent good contact for electrical test. Thus, reduced tendency toward flashing will improve the plastic package subassembly operations. The information from this test will be of value in rating flash performance of any given compound to that in production use.\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 3  Apparatus\n\n3.1  Transfer molding press with a platen area sufficient to maintain a uniform mold temperature and having (1) a transfer piston pressure potential of 1000 psi on the material; (2) sufficient clamping pressure to prevent flashing of the molding compound at clamping lands; and (3) a minimum plunger speed of $2 5 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (1 inch) per second without load.

These voids impede the flow of heat from the chip to the substrate (package). Due to the difference in the thermal time constants of the chip and package, the measurement of transient thermal response can be made more sensitive to the presence of voids than can the measurement of steady state thermal response. This is because the chip thermal time constant is generally several orders of magnitude shorter than that of the package. Thus, the heating power pulse width can\n\nSEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G42-0996 (Reapproved 1104) SPECIFICATION FOR THERMAL TEST BOARD STANDARDIZATION FOR MEASURING JUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT THERMAL RESISTANCE OF SEMICONDUCTOR PACKAGES - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: be selected so that only the chip and the chip to substrate interface are heated during the pulse by using a pulse width somewhat greater than the chip thermal time constant, but less than that of the substrate. Heating power pulse widths ranging from 10 to 400 milliseconds have been found to satisfy this criterion. This enables the detection of voids to be greatly enhanced, with the added advantage of not having to heat sink the device under test. Thus, the transient thermal response technique is less time consuming than the measurement of thermal resistance for use as a manufacturing screen, process control or incoming inspection measure for die attachment integrity evaluation. 1.3 References — The following d ocuments are recommended reading for reference and test method standard description purposes: SEMI G32 — Unencapsulated Thermal Test Chip MIL-STD-883C1 Method 1012, Thermal Characteristics",
