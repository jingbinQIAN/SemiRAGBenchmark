The model consists of equipment characteristics and behavior that are to be implemented in addition to the SEMI E30 fundamental requirements and additional capabilities. The intent of this standard is to facilitate the integration of ISEM equipment into an automated (semiconductor fabrication) factory. This document accomplishes this by defining an operational model for ISEM equipment as viewed by a factory automation controller. This definition provides a standard host interface and equipment operational behavior (e.g., control, state models, data reports, and reporting levels). Several topics require additional activity that are within the scope of this standard: substrate pattern maps; defect classification code management; and review data management. 2.3 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  This document addresses three distinct types of equipment: inspection, review, and inspection/review. The term ISEM equipment refers to all three types of equipment. These three equipment types are differentiated by the basic functions they perform:  \n3.1.1  Inspection Equipment that loo ks for anomalies on a substrate and reports information regarding those anomalies. Inspection equipment may determine the location of anomalies relative to a coordinate system. Inspection equipment may also provide other types of data related to the anomaly.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  The scope of this standard is li mited to the definition of Inspection, Review, and Inspection/ Review equipment behavior as perceived by a SEMI Equipment Communications Standard II (SEMI E5/SECS-II) host that complies with SEMI E30. It defines the external view of the equipment through the SECS link; it does not define the internal operation of the equipment. This standard expands the SEMI E30 requirements and capabilities in the areas of the processing state model, remote commands, variable items, alarms, and data collection.  \n3.1.2  Review Equipment that accept s information about anomalies on a substrate, gathers information on those anomalies, and reports that data.  \n3.1.3  Inspection/Review Equipment having the characteristics of both inspection and review equipment.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 4.1  SEMI Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nContent: 2.2 This standard is intended for IS EM equipment that generates data and information about anomalies and defects found on substrates. Inspection equipment finds anomalies. Anomalies are occurrences on a substrate that have been judged to be unexpected, abnormal, incongruous, or inconsistent. Anomalies may be examined using review equipment, at which time they may be classified as defects or non-defects. Some inspection equipment may generate, and some review equipment may use, coordinate data to locate anomalies on a substrate. The accuracy of the coordinate data generated or used is equipment-dependent.

This standard requires implementation of all SEMI E30 state models (such as control, communication, and online/off-line). A state model consists of state model diagrams, state definitions, and a state transition table. All state transitions in this standard, unless otherwise specified, shall correspond to collection events. 7.1.2 A state model is the host’s vie w of the equipment and does not necessarily describe the internal equipment operation. All ISEM state model transitions shall be mapped sequentially into the appropriate internal equipment events that satisfy the requirements of those transitions. In certain implementations, the equipment may enter a state and have already satisfied all of the conditions required by the ISEM state model for transition to another state. The equipment makes the required transition without any additional actions in this situation. 7.1.3 Some equipment may need to\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 7.1  Processing State Model Requi rements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 7.1  Processing State Model Requi rements\n\nContent: include additional states other than those in this standard. Additional states may be added but shall not change the ISEM-defined state transitions. All expected transitions between ISEM states shall occur. 7.2 Processing State Model Diagram — Processing state models are detailed for ISEM equipment in Figure 1. This diagram contains all states and transitions that are common to all three types of ISEM equipment. The WORKING state is different for each type of equipment. The same state names and transition identifiers are used to identify common states and transitions of the three types of equipment. The working states for the three types of equipment are presented in the following sections. All states and transitions are described in the section following the diagrams. 7.2.1 Working State for Inspection E quipment Model — The processing state model for inspection equipment is identical to the Generic ISEM Processing State Model (Figure 1).

When additional processing is required, then the next unprocessed substrate shall be transferred to the equipment processing location, such as the stage. If equipment determines that there are more process programs in the “CARRIERBLD” ISEM job, the equipment makes the transition to setup for the next process program specified. Otherwise, the equipment transitions to IDLE through STOPPING. 7.3.18 PAUSE (PROCESS ACTIVE Sub-State) PROCESS shall be suspended at the next opportunity. Actions to put the equipment in a “safe state” shall be performed. The equipment is awaiting a command\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 7.3.15  INSPECT REGION — A regio n on a substrate is being inspected for anomalies.

For example, the selected process program may have already been loaded (e.g., if it was the default process program), or the specified material may have already been placed on the equipment material port. Additional information may come from the host during the execution of this state.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 7.4  Processing State Transition Ta ble\n\n7.3.29  STOPPING (PROCESSING ACTIVE SubState) — The equipment has completed all process programs within a “CARRIERBLD” ISEM job or has been instructed to stop processing and shall do so gracefully at the next opportunity. All cleanup necessary is being completed within this state with regard to material, data, control system, etc. Data is normally preserved.

The host can use the report definition scenario defined in SEMI E30 to define reports at ISEM-defined levels. The intent of this section is to ensure data is available at specific events and to optimize data reporting to the SECS-II host by allowing data to be grouped at reporting levels.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 8.1  Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 8.1  Requirements\n\nContent: 8.1.1 This standard requires all colle ction events listed in the SEMI E30 standard. This standard requires the ISEM events in Table 2 for data collection (RunDataComplete, SubstrateDataComplete, GroupDataComplete, RegionDataComplete, and AnomalyDataComplete). These events are separate from the processing state transitions. These collection events shall occur before or on the processing state transition specified in Table 1. This was done to ensure that the data and the material remain synchronous. As a result, in some cases material processing may be delayed due to extended data processing time. 8.1.2 The most fundamental level of data defined for ISEM equipment is the anomaly level for review equipment and region level for inspection equipment. For example, review equipment has data available for individual anomalies at the AnomalyDataComplete event. Anomaly data may be grouped for level reporting. For example, data for anomalies found within a region on a substrate would be available at the RegionDataComplete event. This\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 8.1  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 8.1  Requirements\n\nContent: data would be available as a list variable item for Region Anomalies. All anomalies found on a substrate would be available at the SubstrateDataComplete event. This could either be 1) a list of list variable items for Region Anomaly, or 2) a single list variable item of all Substrate Anomalies. In this way, data can be reported with less high-level event reports, rather than as more low-level event reports. 8.1.3 Data produced by ISEM equip ment is customarily grouped for reporting by processing, material, and equipment constraints which are called reporting levels (i.e., run, substrate, group, site, and anomaly data). Level data is grouped by these constraints for a reporting level. Data shall be grouped within a reporting level according to other constraints by degree of processing (e.g., raw sensor, basic, or analyzed data), or statistically (e.g., summary, correlation, or comparison).

Values of these variables shall be available to the host via collection event reports and host status queries. These variable items are separated into three categories: (a) common to all ISEM equipment; (b) specific to inspection equipment; (c) and specific to review equipment.  \nIf equipment supports the data item functionality defined by ISEM, then it is required and shall be implemented as specified in Table 4 “Variable Item Dictionary”. That is, a variable item is only required if the equipment supports the functionality necessary to support it. For example, if an inspection instrument only has the hardware to count detected anomalies and lacks the hardware to determine their size, then the ISEM requires it to report anomaly count (e.g., as SubstrateAnomalyCount), but reporting anomaly size (as AnomalySize) is not required by the ISEM.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 9.1  Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 9.1  Requirements\n\nContent: • All variable items and data item restrictions defined in SEMI E30 are required on ISEM equipment. • All variable items in the ISEM Variable Item Dictionary for specific equipment classifications are required for ISEM equipment. The data item restrictions are also required. 9.1.1 Variable items are categorized in the Variable Item Dictionary as follows: Common Variables $( C V )$ — variables common to all ISEM equipment. Inspection-Specific Variables (ISV) — variables required only for inspection equipment. • Review-Specific Variables (RSV) — variables required only for review equipment. 9.2 Variable Items and Reporting Levels — Table 3 defines reporting levels and associated Data Collection Events for which Variable Items are valid for. Table 3 Variable Items and Reporting Levels 9.2.1 Variable items are documented in the ISEM Variable Item Dictionary using the following format: Where: Variable Name: A unique name for the variable item (this name is for reference only).

Level: The report level at which this variable is used <R| S| G| X| A| ALL> as defined in Table 3. It als indicates when the variable item is valid. Class: The data type of the item. Format: <SECS Message Language (SML) mnemonic> acceptable formats are SEMI E5 lists, ASCII, floating point, unsigned integer, or signed integer. A description of “ANY” indicates that only the above formats are acceptable and is left to the tool vendor to decide. Comments: Any additional information pertinent to the variable name.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 9.3  Variable Item Types\n\n9.3.1  Equipment Constants (ECV) — The value can be changed by the host using S2,F15. The operator may have the ability to change some or all of the values. The value of an equipment constant may be queried at any time by the host using the S2,F13/14 transaction or Stream 6 reports.  \n9.3.2  Status Variables (SV) — The values are valid at all times. A SV may not be changed by the host or operator but may be changed by the equipment. A host or operator command may change an equipment status, thus changing an SV. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at any time using the S1,F3/4 or Stream 6 reports.  \n9.3.3  Data Variables (DVVAL) — T hese are variables which are valid upon the occurrence of a specific collection event and which may or may not be valid at other times, depending upon the equipment. An attempt to read a variable item when it is invalid will not result in an error, but the data reported may not have relevant meaning.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 9.4  Variable Item Dictionary\n\n9.4.1  Data Validity — The “Level” column in Table 4 defines when the variable item is valid. The entry in this column corresponds to a reporting level defined in Section 9.2 “Variable Items and Reporting Levels”. For example, “RunAnomalyCount” is valid at the “RunDataComplete” event, and “AnomalySize” is valid at all reporting level data collection events.  \nTable 4  Variable Item Dictionary\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 10  Alarm List\n\nSince each model of equipment differs in configuration, it is not practical to provide an exhaustive list of all possible alarms. Instead, the ISEM is requiring the two tables provided as described in SEMI E30 (document section). Alarm List Table, which is intended to provide for equipment configuration-specific alarms and Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 10.1  Alarm List Table\n\n10.1.1  The alarm list table contains ex amples of alarms that pertain to various configuration aspects of equipment. These examples are intended to illustrate that alarms pertain to situations in which there exists a potential for exceeding physical safety limits associated with people, equipment, and material being processed as per the SEMI E30 definition of an alarm. (See SEMI E30 for further reference.)\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 10.2  Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared E vent Table\n\n10.2.1  The Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table documents the association of each ALID to a set and cleared event as required by SEMI E30. (See SEMI E30 for further reference.)\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11  ISEM Tables\n\nA fundamental requirement of ISEM equipment is to transfer anomaly and review data between itself and the host. ISEM equipment may also be required to transfer “Area” and “Alignment Site” data needed for run setup. Anomaly and review data sets (as well as area and alignment site data sets) are commonly handled as lists and tables. ISEM equipment shall use tables when transferring this kind of data between itself and the host. List shall be used to refer to sub-sets of this table data.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11.1  ISEM Table Data\n\n11.1.1  ISEM Tables are used to specif y area, alignment site, and anomaly coordinate lists for ISEM equipment. ISEM Tables are transferred between the host and the equipment using SECS-II Stream 13 messages (Unformatted Data Set Transfers). For example, an ISEM Table may be used to transfer anomaly data (e.g., “M21” coordinates) generated by inspection equipment to the host, which in turn may then be transferred to review equipment from the host. ISEM Tables also include attributes items that are associated with the table, not with the table data. ISEM Table attributes are used to include information associated with table data, like the number of columns (NumCols), number of rows (NumRows), and table size (DataLength). (See SEMI E58 for additional information.) Product or process-related information may also be included on the attribute section of the ISEM Tables (e.g., LotID, ProductID, OperatorID, ProcessEquipmentID) (see Table 4). The ISEM does not specify additional table attribute variable items that may be associated with the table.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11.2  TABLE-DEFs\n\n11.2.1  ISEM Tables are documented using TABLEDEF structures (Figure 5). Each TABLE-DEF structure has a unique name (TableID) and type (TableType). Each column in the TABLE-DEF has a name (e.g., “AREANAME”, “ALIGNNAME”, OR “ANOMALYID”); row names are specific instances or values that correspond to the column headers in TABLE-DEF. A specific TABLE-DEF row is designated by referring to the TABLE-DEF name and the specific row name. ISEM Tables are transferred using standard (SECS-II message) Stream 13 messages (Figure 6), and each ISEM-defined TABLE-DEF item maps into a Stream 13 message item. Align and area data tables are hostdefined, and anomaly tables are equipment-defined.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # TableID $\\ c =$ <TableName>\n\nTable $\\mathrm { T y p e } = < T a b l e .$ Def>\nFigure 5 TABLE-DEF Structure  \nAn example of usage of S13,F13 to transfer data sets is shown below:  \n7\n1. <DATAID>\n2. <OBJSPEC>\n3. “TableDef” <TBLTYP>\n4. “TableName” <TBLID>\n5.

SEMI M21 anomaly table type may be supported, but it is optional. The ISEM equipment shall be able to store simultaneously at least 3 (three) defined tables of each type supported to guarantee the validity of any table while that table is being transferred (a table transfer transaction is in process).  \nISEM align and area tables are stored by the equipment during the current inspection or review run (i.e., until a new remote command PP-SELECT or PP-ASSIGN is sent, or until they are modified with PP-UPDATE).  \nTable 5  ISEM Table Types (TABLE-DEFs)  \nAs indicated in Table 5, the SEMI M21 anomaly definition table “TABLE-M21-ANOMALY-DEF” is optional. The others are required.  \nISEM requires that the following columns be included in the TABLE-DEFs. Table 6 defines the column headers and the allowed formats. Anomaly attributes and attribute headings are defined by the supplier, based on equipment capability.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11.3.1  “TABLE-AREA-DEF”\n\nTableType: “TableAreaDef”  \nTableID: <AreaTableName>\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11.3.2 “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”\n\nTableType: “TableAlignDef”  \nTableID: <AlignTableName>\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11.3.3  “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF”\n\nTableType: “TableAnomalyDef”  \nTableID: <AnomalyTableName>\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 11.3.4  “TABLE-M21-ANOMALY-DEF”\n\nTableType $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ “TableM21AnomalyDef” TableID $= < M 2$ 1AnomalyTableName>  \nDefect data shall be transferred between the host and inspection/review/analysis equipment using SEMI E5, S13,F13.

Inspection tools should support relevant columns (see NOTE 6). Review and analysis tools should support all columns. Multiple data entries (list format data items) are allowed for a given attribute on a single defect. NOTE 2: The inspection equipment must add a table attribute called “Substrate Header” (ATTRID). It must be a list that includes the following items in the given order: LotID (A[1..16]), SubstrateID (A[1..16]), ProcessEquipmentID (A[1..16]), substrate center1 (L[2], CoordX (F4), CoordY (F4)) and centering method2 (A[1..16]). Refer to Table 4, Variable Item Dictionary for descriptions of these items. NOTE 3: See SEMI M21 for (0,0) die location methodology. NOTE 4: Die origin is located at lower left-hand corner (LLHC).

The process program shall supply all of the information required for a remotely executed run to be processed without operator intervention.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.2  Requirements\n\n12.2.1  The ISEM requires that the SE MI E30 capability of Process Program Management be fully supported for this class of equipment. ISEM requires that the process program have a structure that enables the user to build process programs with default conditions that can be overridden for a run. ISEM requires the ability to vary the quantity of substrates processed, the alignment information used, and the number and/or location of the areas/anomalies to be inspected/reviewed through the uses of process program variable parameters. The concepts of process program structure and process program variable parameters are discussed in the following sections.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.3  Process Program Structure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.3  Process Program Structure\n\nContent: 12.3.1 The purpose of this process pr ogram structure and the related concepts is to provide flexibility in using process programs to reduce the number of process programs needed. This structure enables the user or host to vary certain parameters of a given process program as needed for any particular run. 12.3.2 Often a process program may be very similar from one run to another and may differ only in a few parameters such as: which substrate slots to run, which areas to inspect, which parameters to run on each substrate, etc. Previously this small variation from run to run would require a large number of process programs to be created and maintained. The flexibility of the method described in this section will reduce the number of process programs. 12.4 Process Program Variable Pa rameters — A process program parameter specifies a value that temporarily modifies the value of a process program variable parameter. A process program variable parameter is formally defined within a process program body and contains\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.3  Process Program Structure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.3  Process Program Structure\n\nContent: (1) a variable parameter name that is unique in the body (CPNAME), and (2) a parameter default value for use when the process program is selected for execution without specification of an override value for this variable parameter (CPVAL/CPEVAL).\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.1 Overriding Process Program Variable Parameters Default Values\n\n12.4.1.1  Any process-related informatio n that is normally requested from the operator console in manual operation shall have a process program variable parameter identified in the process program and default values assigned in the body of the process program. An equipment would run the process program using the default values unless those values were overridden.  \n12.4.1.2  These process program variable parameters allow a host to tailor a process program for a specific run of material by temporarily modifying (replacing) the process program default values using a remote command of PP-UPDATE. The modification does not permanently change the process program; the modifications remain in effect only until the next run or until the next PP-UPDATE remote command is received.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: 12.4.2.1 ISEM equipment is required to support variable process program parameters. Additionally, ISEM process programs are required to contain variable process program parameters that specify a name for each of the four previously defined ISEM table types. Specifically, parameters for “TABLE-AREA-DEF”, “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”, “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF”, and “TABLE-M21-ANOMALY-DEF” table names are required. Only the names that refer to these TABLEDEFs are required to be included in the process program body. The actual TABLE-DEF data is external to the process program body. The host may always assume that there are variable process program parameters for these four ISEM tables. 12.4.2.2 Before execution of a CARRIE RBLD can begin, the presence of all the ISEM Tables that it references shall be verified by the equipment. If they are not all present, an error shall be reported. The equipment shall support data items that may be linked to the event report that specifies the name of missing ISEM Tables. S7,F27 is used for\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: reporting this error condition. 12.4.2.3 The following table summarizes the variable process program parameters that ISEM equipment shall support and the remote command parameters that the host may use to override their values (as defined in Section 13 and Table 9). Table 7 Required Variable Process Program Parameters 12.4.3 Modifying Process Program V ariable Parameters — The remote commands of PP-SELECT, PP-ASSIGN, or PP-UPDATE are used to modify any of the identified process program variable parameters within the process program. The modification is done by including CPNAME/CPVAL pairs within the “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”, which is part of the remote commands of PP-SELECT or PP-ASSIGN, or by including a different list name in the PP-UPDATE remote command. A CPNAME in a process program shall be identical to the process program variable parameter name as specified in the “PROCESS-BLDGROUP”. See next section for details of these parameters. 12.5 Use of Process Programs, Remote Commands, and “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” — This\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: is a brief description of the steps involved in using the process program structure, the process program variable parameters, the TABLE-DEFs, and the modification of process program variable parameters through the use of “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” and CPNAME/CEPVAL pairs in the enhanced remote command (S2,F49). A process program is created with certain items in the body identified as process program variable parameters, along with their default values. The host sends to equipment one or more TABLEDEFs: such as “TABLE-AREA-DEF” and “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”, along with the names of those tables using Stream 13 commands (See SEMI E5). These tables are now resident on the equipment. The host sends an enhanced remote command (S2,F49) to the equipment (either PP-SELECT or PP-ASSIGN) that contains the information needed for processing (“CARRIERBLD”). The “CARRIERBLD” contains a “PROCESS-BLDGROUP” for each different set of run parameters that are needed during the inspection or review process. “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” shall contain the\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: ProcessBuildGroupID to identify which program is selected. If the default list of slots in the process program needs to be changed for this run, then “PROCESSBLD-GROUP” contains a “MATERIALLIST” and the list of selected slots or substrates, designated by SlotIDs or SubstrateIDs. If the default set of inspection areas in the process program needs to be changed for this run, then “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” contains the name of a specific “TABLE-AREA-DEF” (in AreaTable Name). If not all of the inspection areas given in that “TABLE-AREA-DEF” are needed for this run, then “AREALIST” is used and includes a list of the names of the specific inspection areas which are needed. Those names refer to inspection areas defined in the “TABLE-AREA-DEF”. If the default set of alignment sites in the process program needs to be changed for this run, then “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” contains the name of a specific “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF” (in AlignTable Name). If not all of the alignment sites given in that “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF” are needed for this run, then\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: “ALIGNLIST” is used and includes a list of the names of the specific alignment sites which are needed. Those names refer to alignment sites defined in the “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”. If the SEMI M21 coordinate system is being used and a pattern has been defined with pattern element names and if only certain of those elements need to be inspected for this run, then “PROCESS-BLDGROUP” contains an “ELEMENTLIST” and the list of selected elements, designated by ElementIDs. If certain equipment-specific process program variable parameters need to have different values for this run, then for each needed parameter, “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” contains a CPNAME (unique name of a specific process program variable parameter) and the new CEPVAL (new value for that parameter). The equipment executes the process program with the new values. If indicated in the process program, the equipment generates the list of anomalies found and sends it to the host in the format of a “TABLE-ANOMALYDEF” using the ISEM table definition and Stream 13 transfer\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: messages (see SEMI E5 for format specification). The host would send the “TABLE-ANOMALYDEF” to a review equipment. The host might need to modify part of the table if required by the review equipment. This anomaly table is now resident on the review equipment. (NOTE: The host might choose to not send all of the table of anomalies, but rather a desired selection of them.) The host sends the equipment the enhanced remote command (PP-SELECT or PP-ASSIGN) that contains a “CARRIERBLD”. The “CARRIERBLD” has a “PROCESS-BLDGROUP” for each different set of run parameters that is needed by the review equipment. It is required for the host to use the Enhanced Remote Command S2,F49 for transferring the information to the equipment. “PROCESS-BLD-GROUP” includes the name of a specific “TABLEANOMALY-DEF” in the parameter AnomalyTableName. If not all of the anomalies given in that “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF” are needed for this run, then either “ANOMALYLIST” or “M21-ANOMALYLIST” is used and includes a list of the names of the specific\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 12.4.2  Requirements and Rules\n\nContent: anomalies which are desired. Those names refer to anomalies defined in the named “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF”. The equipment runs the process program using the selected values and reviewing the specific anomalies indicated. The equipment adds review information to the ANOMALYATTRIBUTE list. Then the review equipment sends this modified “TABLEANOMALY-DEF” to the host.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13  Remote Commands\n\nThe purpose of this section is to identify remote commands, command parameters, and valid commands versus states pertinent to the SEM.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.1  Requirements (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.1  Requirements\n\nContent: The equipment shall support the SEMI E30 required remote commands. All the remote commands defined by ISEM are required unless they have been qualified by the statement “if the equipment supports this functionality, it shall use this command.” In this case, they are only required if the equipment supports the functionality necessary to support the command. A good example of this is the MAPCARRIER command. If the equipment does not have the hardware necessary to scan a carrier for the presence of substrates in slots, then the command is not required by the ISEM. The alphanumeric strings defined by ISEM for RCMD and CPNAME are required. Host Command Parameter (CPNAME/CPVAL) — A parameter name/value associated with a particular host command when using stream function (S2,F41) and a (CPNAME/CEPVAL) parameter name/value when using the enhanced remote command (S2,F49). This document specifies unique names (CPNAMEs) and values (CPVALs and CEPVALs) for many command parameters. Note that if there are no associated parameters, a zero\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.1  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.1  Requirements\n\nContent: length list is sent. The purpose of the remote commands is to allow host control over the following capabilities: Start processing Stop processing Temporarily suspend processing Resume processing Abort processing Select process programs, material, and/or sites to measure Report location of material found The following remote commands (RCMDs) shall be supported as described below: NOTE 3: The terms “current cycle” and “safe point” used below are to be defined by the supplier.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description\n\nContent: 1. ABORT — Terminate the current cycle prior to its completion. ABORT has the intent of immediately stopping the process and is used because of abnormal conditions. ABORT makes no guarantee about the subsequent condition of material except as noted in the “ABORTLEVEL” description. 2. CLEANUP — De-selection of the current ISEM job (“CARRIERBLD”) and process program (“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”), including the removal of all material to output locations and any equipment-specific activities needed to transition into the IDLE state. Completion of this command should generate a collection event report. If the equipment supports this functionality, it will use this command. 3. MAP-CARRIER — Requests the equipment to provide a list of carrier slots that contain material. MAP-CARRIER has the intent of providing the host with enough information about the location and/or ID of material so it may select material for processing accordingly. Completion of this command shall generate a collection event report. If the equipment\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description\n\nContent: supports this functionality, it must use this command. 4. NEXT-MATERIAL — Processing of the current substrate is halted at the first safe point and unloaded to the target carrier location. NEXTMATERIAL has the intent of allowing the host to skip measurement of the current substrate. This is a trigger for processing state transition from WORKING to UNLOAD. If the equipment supports this functionality, it will use this command. 5. PAUSE — Suspend processing temporarily at the next safe point. PAUSE has the intent of resuming the process at the same point where it was paused. RESUME or PP-UPDATE may be used to resume the process. 6. PP-ASSIGN — Instructs the equipment that supports queuing to create a new ISEM job (“CARRIERBLD”) for the specified port (“LOCATIONID”) when more than one port is available for processing. If only one port is available, “LOCATIONID” is not required. Priority may optionally be specified with this command. The “PRIORITY” specifies the priority of the newly created job in the ISEM job\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description\n\nContent: queue (a value of 0 (zero) assigns the highest priority to the job). Without specifying a priority, the job is queued with the default priority. Jobs with equal priority are queued in the order the PP-ASSIGN commands are received. This command is valid in all PROCESSING states. 7. PP-SELECT — Instructs the equipment to make the requested ISEM job(s) (“CARRIERBLD”) available in the execution area. This is a trigger for the processing state transition from IDLE to SETTING UP. The first process program (“PROCESS-BLD-GROUP”) specified in the “CARRIERBLD” is also validated during SETTING UP. 8. PP-UNASSIGN — Removes the ISEM job assignment (“CARRIERBLD”) for a carrier or port. The carrier or port is removed from the process queue. 9. PP-UPDATE — Provides the ability to alter the current process program being executed during the PAUSED state. The process program variables specified in the PP-UPDATE command will replace previous definitions in the “PROCESSBLD-GROUP”. This command will trigger transition to CHECKING\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description\n\nContent: for process program parameter verification. A RESUME command is implied with the validation of “all” replaced values to resume the process. If the PP-UPDATE fails, the process program variables present prior to the PPUPDATE are retained. If no parameters values are specified, the defaults are used. 10. RESUME — Resume processing from the point where the process was paused. This is the trigger for processing state transition from PROCESS PAUSE to the previous PROCESS state. 11. START — Instructs the equipment to initiate processing. This is the trigger for the processing state transition from READY to LOAD. An “AUTOSTART” command parameter may be included to allow for continuous processing. 12. STOP — Complete the current cycle, stop in a safe condition, and return to the IDLE processing state. Stop has the intent of stopping the process entirely. This command can be used to both: stop the current ISEM job or to stop all queued jobs. The equipment is not required to support the continuation of processing.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # 13.2  Remote Commands Description\n\nContent: 13.2.1 Remote Commands and Associated Host Command Parameters — This table describes the allowable command parameters (CPNAME) for each remote command (RCMD).

R1-1.1 Classification Codes and Defect Classification — One function of review equipment is to view previously identified anomalies and to associate a defect classification code with each anomaly. A classification code is an identifier for a classification description. Typically, the review equipment has a set of defect classification codes and their descriptions available to the operator. Then, for each anomaly, the operator selects a particular code to be associated with that anomaly. This action is defect classification. The set of valid classification codes and their descriptions may change from one run to another. For example, the same main process program could be used with different substrate levels, and each level may use a different set of\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-1  Defect Classification Code Management (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-1  Defect Classification Code Management\n\nContent: classification codes. The purpose of this section is to provide the requirements so that a user can both define several sets of classification codes and their descriptions and can also manage these sets on ISEM equipment.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-1.2  Requirements\n\nEach set of classification codes and their descriptions shall have an identifier, known as a classification code set ID.\nReview equipment shall provide a means for the\nuser (the host or the operator) to define a classification code set, consisting of (a) the\nclassification code set ID and (b) the list of\nclassification codes and their descriptions.\nEquipment shall provide a means to manage the\nvarious classification code sets.\nA main process program shall include a process\nprogram variable that specifies the particular classification code set ID to be used.\nEquipment vendor shall provide documentation to\nthe user regarding how to define and manage classification code sets.  \nComment: In one implementation, the equipment considers a classification code set to be a sub-process program or an ISEM table. This would allow the user to identify a classification code set by name (using a PPID) or a table name and thereby managing this subprocess program with the SEMI E30 Process Program Capability or with SEMI E58 ARAMS tables.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: The purpose of this section is to provide a method and specific formats to define, identify, and communicate coordinate systems and site locations on substrates for alignment sites, anomaly locations, and other sites used by ISEM equipment. The ISEM-required formats are intended to minimize the number and type of site location format transformations needing to be supported by both equipment suppliers and users. All ISEM-required site location formats involve the use of an ISEM-defined right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, established on substrates in an ISEM-defined manner. The scope of the detailed methods in this section are specific to unpatterned and patterned wafers in this release, but the section is intended to be general enough in methodology so that it can be extended to other substrate types in future revisions of ISEM, if required. The purpose of inspection and review equipment is to locate, evaluate, classify, and report anomalies on substrates. ISEM equipment may deal with\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: either unpatterned or patterned substrates or both. In most cases, the anomaly location is part of the information reported and/or used by ISEM equipment. An anomaly location is reported at a particular site with x,y coordinates in a particular coordinate system. Site coordinates are also used by ISEM equipment for the alignment sites for defining a coordinate system on a substrate. A standard method is needed to define a coordinate system and to report site coordinates for both alignment sites, anomaly locations, and any other reference sites needed by ISEM equipment. A standard method is essential in order to transfer the anomaly site information from one equipment to another. R1-2.1 Site Location Accuracy — Each equipment has an accuracy with which it can define or locate a site as being within a certain area. This area associated with a site is determined by the equipment accuracy, based on the accuracy of its motion and imaging systems to locate a site, as well as on the accuracy with\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: which it can define the coordinate system on the substrate. When equipment shall locate a particular site on a substrate based on the expected or design-based location, then the location of a site or feature on an actual substrate is further affected by the accuracy of the equipment which placed the pattern on the substrate. R1-2.2 Expected or Designed Locations vs. Actual Locations — The placement of patterns, sites, and coordinate systems is designed to be at certain mathematically described locations relative to one another and to an ideal substrate. These are the expected or designed locations. When a pattern is written by equipment onto a specific substrate, the actual placement of the pattern, the pattern-elements, and their features may differ from the expected locations, due to variations in equipment performance and variations in substrate shape and dimensions. R1-2.3 Substrate Coordinate Systems (Unpatterned) — A substrate coordinate system is a coordinate system which has both\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: origin and axes defined by the shape and dimensions of the substrate and which does not depend on whether there is a pattern on the substrate or whether it is unpatterned. This coordinate system is used to locate or define sites relative to the substrate. R1-2.4 Substrate Pattern Coordinate System — A substrate pattern coordinate system is a coordinate system which has its origin and axes defined by the pattern as a whole on the substrate. This coordinate system is used to locate or to define sites relative to the pattern on the substrate. The expected or designed location of the pattern on the substrate can be defined in terms of the placement of the origin and axes of the substrate pattern coordinate system relative to those of the substrate coordinate system. The actual location of a pattern on a substrate may differ from the expected location. The actual location is determined by locating two or more alignment sites on the patterned substrate. The alignment sites are specific points of\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: certain features in the pattern. The coordinates of the alignment sites are given in the substrate pattern coordinate system. In many cases, equipment does not align to the specific pattern elements but instead uses the defined locations of the pattern elements within the substrate pattern coordinate system. R1-2.5 Pattern Element Coordinate System — A pattern-element coordinate system is a coordinate system which has its origin and axes defined by the pattern of one specific rectangular element in a pattern (a defined arrangement) of equal-sized rectangular elements. This coordinate system is used to locate or to define sites relative to that specific pattern-element. The expected or designed location of the pattern-element within a pattern can be defined in terms of the placement of the origin and axes of the pattern-element coordinate system relative to those of the pattern coordinate system. The actual location of a patternelement within a pattern on a substrate may differ from the\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: expected location. The actual location is determined by locating two or more alignment sites within the pattern-element. The coordinates of the alignment sites are given in the pattern-element coordinate system. R1-2.6 Parallel Coordinate Systems — A second coordinate system is considered to be parallel to a first coordinate system if the origin of the second can be defined as a translation from the origin of the first and if the axes of the second are parallel and in the same direction as those of the first. R1-2.7 Requirements — The following is a list of requirements for ISEM equipment regarding coordinate systems and reporting site locations: ISEM equipment shall document whether it deals with coordinate systems based on (a) a substrate, (b) a substrate pattern, or (c) a pattern-element or whether it deals with several of these coordinate systems. ISEM equipment shall establish a substrate coordinate system using a standard, documented method. This coordinate system is not based on any\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: pattern on the substrate. This coordinate system shall be a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system and shall be identified by a name. NOTE: For wafers, this method is defined in SEMI M20 (Specification for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate System), and the coordinate system is named “M20.” For equipment dealing with substrate pattern coordinates, the substrate pattern coordinate system shall be established in a standard, documented method relative to the substrate coordinate system (the “unpatterned” coordinate system). This substrate pattern coordinate system shall be a righthand Cartesian coordinate system and shall be designed to be parallel to the substrate coordinate system. The substrate pattern coordinate system shall be identified by a name. The location of its origin and axes relative to the substrate coordinate system shall be communicated in terms of the substrate coordinate system.

For equipment dealing with pattern-element coordinates, the pattern-element coordinate system shall be established in a standard, documented method relative either to the substrate pattern coordinate system or to another pattern-element coordinate system. The pattern-element coordinate system shall be a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system which is designed to be parallel to the substrate pattern coordinate system. The patternelement coordinate system shall be identified by a name. The location of its origin and axis relative to the substrate pattern coordinate system shall be communicated in terms of the substrate pattern coordinate system.

ISEM requires that equipment have the capability to use site location information that is based on the user’s product designs, which the user shall provide in the appropriate ISEM-required format. ISEM-compliant equipment shall have the capability to define, locate, and report site information using only the ISEM-defined righthanded Cartesian coordinate system formats. This requirement does not preclude equipment from having additional capability for defining or reporting site location information using other formats. Coordinate system name and placement relative to the “higher” coordinate system shall be defined and communicated using the following ISEM data items, in terms of either expected or actual placement: CoordSys, XlateData, and their included\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: data items. Alignment site information shall be defined and communicated using the following ISEM items: the variable item AlignList, the “ALIGNLIST”, the Process program class of “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”, and their included information. Areas to be inspected shall be reported using the specific coordinate system defined by the user. The following ISEM items are used to define and communicate area locations: the variable item “AREALIST”, the “AREALIST”, and the Process program class of “TABLE-AREA-DEF”, and their included information. The displacement of an actual coordinate system relative to its expected location shall be communicated using the ISEM data item: XlateData and its included data items. The displacement of an actual site location relative to its expected site location shall be communicated using the ISEM data item: Offset and its included data items. The equipment vendor shall document the requirements for the ISEM data items used in alignment of a coordinate system. The equipment\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-2  Reporting Coordinates and Coordinate Systems\n\nContent: vendor shall provide and document a means for the user to define and communicate a pattern map using SEMI M21 data. A pattern map defines the layout of equal-sized rectangular pattern-elements which make up a pattern. Each pattern-element shall have a name, using the SEMI M21 naming convention. NOTE: For patterned wafers, the naming method shall be that described in SEMI M21, and the pattern-element information shall be communicated using the ISEM data item of SEMI M21Data. For ISEM compliance, inspection equipment shall report various anomaly data; AnomalyID, coordinates, and attributes. Review equipment shall receive this data for anomalies and be able to locate them and perhaps modify the coordinates. Anomaly coordinates shall be reported using ISEM table named “TABLE-ANOMALY-DEF” and its included data.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate\n\nContent: R1-3.1 SEMI M20 Coordinate System — The SEMI M20 standard (Specification for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate System) describes how to map a righthanded Cartesian coordinate system to a substrate so that its origin is at the center of the substrate, and its negative $y$ -axis bisects the substrate’s primary fiducial. This coordinate system is defined by ISEM to be the “M20” coordinate system. The only information required by equipment in order to establish an $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\omega } _ { M 2 0 } } \\mathbf { \\vec { \\omega } }$ coordinate system is the substrate size and the type of fiducial, which are communicated using the ISEM data items named SubstrateSize and Fiducial. Another ISEM data item named Orientation identifies how the substrate is loaded on the equipment. Note that the SEMI M20 standard requires that the $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\omega } } _ { \\mathbf { M } 2 0 } \\mathbf { \\vec { \\omega } } _ { }$ coordinate system is fixed on the substrate and is not affected by how the substrate is loaded on\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate\n\nContent: equipment. Also, as stated in the SEMI M20 standard, an orientation of “0” degrees designates a substrate loaded on equipment, with the primary fiducial towards the operator or “down.” R1-3.2 M20P Coordinate System — ISEM defines the M20P coordinate system to be one which is aligned to the pattern on the substrate. The M20P coordinate system is useful because in many cases, it is more significant to the user to know the location of an anomaly relative to the pattern on the substrate rather than relative to the substrate shape and dimensions. ISEM also defines the M20P coordinate system to be one which is designed to be “parallel” to the SEMI M20 coordinate system. In practice, because of experimental errors, both the origins and the axes may differ slightly from their intended values of a simple translation and no rotation. Equipment should be designed to be able to locate the alignment sites, given the various possible experimental errors. R1-3.3 Establishing an M20P Coordinate System — A minimum of two\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate\n\nContent: alignment sites is necessary to establish an M20P coordinate system on a substrate. Additional sites are often used to determine a scaling ratio of the dimensions of the actual coordinate system relative to the dimensions of the expected coordinate system and are reported using the ISEM data item of ScaleFactor. XlateData is used to report actual coordinate system location. Most equipment cannot distinguish whether patterned substrate site location errors are due to the substrate, the layout on the substrate, or the equipment’s ability to locate the sites. However, information that is available through the use of patterned-substrate alignment sites can provide a means for identifying potential equipment problems. For instance, assume that the only pattern-layout location error on a substrate is that due to the establishment of the location of the substrate center and fiducial. For many users and equipment systems, this is a good assumption. If this is the case, then the ISEM data item named XlateData can\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-3  Coordinate System for a Substrate\n\nContent: be used to track this error. Although the error may result from multiple sources, being able to track it on various equipment will enable users to apply statistical process control techniques to identify the specific sources. Offset sites may be found by equipment at actual locations which deviate from their expected locations through either pattern layout errors or equipment “stage” or imaging errors. Again, in a controlled manufacturing process, these combined errors should be normally distributed, and non-normal deviations may indicate possible equipment problems. The actual position of a site relative to its expected position shall be reported through the use of the ISEM data item named Offset.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-4  Layout of Rectangular Pattern Elements on a Substrate Using SEMI M20 Coordinate System\n\nEquipment shall be capable of routine, automated operation without needing substrate layout information (e.g., field or die maps). However, having the capability to provide substrate layout information to equipment from the host can be desirable. ISEM defines a means to do this in this section for substrates, based on SEMI M21 (Specification for Assigning Addresses to Rectangular Elements in a Cartesian Array.) The SEMI M21 standard is limited to defining how to assign “addresses” to elements and how to find the “array center” element. It does not specify how the rectangular pattern-elements are located on the substrate. In this section, ISEM defines how these pattern-elements are located on a substrate, using the data item named M21Data, and how to establish within-element coordinate systems. Any additional layout information, such as within-element structure details or element attribute information, is beyond the scope of ISEM.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-4.1  ISEM “M21” Layouts (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-4.1  ISEM “M21” Layouts\n\nContent: An “M21” layout consists of an array of equalsized rectangular pattern-elements with no space between the pattern elements. ISEM defines the “M21” layout on a substrate to include all pattern-elements which are either wholly or partially within the circumference of the substrate. The ISEM approach is to define the pattern map by specifying the M20P coordinate for the lower left corner of the minimum number of pattern-elements needed to define the layout, along with the patternelement addresses (names). For a non-tiled layout, the location and name of a single pattern-element is sufficient to establish the “M21” layout. For tiled layouts, the location and name of one patternelement in each row or column are required. Note that the location of the lower left corner of some pattern-elements may be outside the circumference of the substrate. The “M21” pattern-element coordinate system shall have its $x$ and $y$ axes parallel to the respective M20P coordinate system axes and shall have their origins at the lower left\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-4.1  ISEM “M21” Layouts (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-4.1  ISEM “M21” Layouts\n\nContent: corner of each element. The pattern-element coordinate system shall have a name and a specific pattern-element address identifier per SEMI M21. Layout definition is supported only for host-toequipment communications. The user is responsible for ensuring that the pattern-element addresses provided to the equipment agree with the SEMI M21 specification. The equipment need not check this, other than to ensure that there are not conflicts within the provided layout, and shall report results with pattern-element addresses as provided by the user. “M21” layouts are established within the M20P coordinate system and need not require any additional alignment site data than is needed to establish the M20P coordinate system. However, as with M20P, additional alignment may be necessary because of errors in either the pattern layout or the equipment’s ability to locate features. Offset shall be used to report the location corrections that result from any within-element alignments.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-5  How an M20P Coordinate System Is Established on a Substrate (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-5  How an M20P Coordinate System Is Established on a Substrate\n\nContent: The following example is fairly basic. For this example, the M20P coordinate system has a zero translation from the SEMI M20 coordinate system. Also, the equipment documentation states that 4 alignment sites are required. The equipment does M20P alignment on two alignment sites and does a low resolution and then a high resolution alignment at each site. Note that the specific alignment point is different at the two resolutions, so the coordinates are slightly different. The alignment sites are defined to the equipment via the process program class named “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF”, as detailed below. The order of the sites in “TABLE-ALIGN-DEF” is not important. The sites are then selected via the CPNAME named “ALIGNLIST”, which is included in the PP-SELECT command. The order of the sites listed in “ALIGNLIST” is important and is as-specified in the equipment’s documentation. The first item is the alignment site for the first low resolution site, the second item is for the first high\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-5  How an M20P Coordinate System Is Established on a Substrate (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R1-5  How an M20P Coordinate System Is Established on a Substrate\n\nContent: resolution site, the third item is the second low resolution site, and the fourth is the second high resolution site.\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME” (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME”\n\nContent: L,4 1. <Coarse1> 2. <Fine1> 3. <Coarse2> 4. <Fine2> Using this information, the equipment will go to the nominal “M20” location for Coarse1, then “find” where it actually is.

The actual M20 location of Fine1 is saved. The process is then repeated for Coarse2 and Fine2. The equipment can now determine the “M20” to M20P offset from the nominal and actual coordinates. First, a summary of the data: $\\mathbf { \\Delta x N 1 } = - 6 0 0 2 0$ $\\mathrm { y N } 1 = - 2 0 5$ Nominal $x$ and $y$ data for the first fine site $\\mathbf { \\Delta x A l } = - 5 9 8 0 0$ $\\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { A } 1 = - 1 5 0$ Actual $x$ and y data for the first fine site $\\mathbf { \\Delta x N } 2 = + 5 9 9 8 0$ $\\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { N } 2 = + 1 9 5$ Nominal $x$ and $y$ data for the second fine site xA2 = +60060 $\\mathbf { y }\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME” (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME”\n\nContent: \\mathbf { A } 2 = + 1 7 5$ Actual $x$ and $y$ data for the second fine site The equipment first calculates Theta, using, for example, the formula: $$ \\Theta = t a n ^ { - 1 } \\Big [ \\frac { \\cal M \\cal A - M \\cal N } { 1 + M { \\cal A } ~ M { \\cal N } } \\Big ] $$ where $M A$ and $M N$ are, respectively, the slopes of the lines connecting the two actual fine sites and the line connecting the two nominal sites, in “M20” coordinates, calculated as follows: $$ M A = \\left[ { \\frac { y A _ { 2 } - y A _ { 1 } } { x A _ { 2 } - x A _ { 1 } } } \\right] M N = \\left[ { \\frac { y N _ { 2 } - y N _ { 1 } } { x N _ { 2 } - x N _ { 1 } } } \\right] $$ The equipment then calculates DeltaX and DeltaY, using, for example, the formulas: $$ \\begin{array} { c } { { D e l t a X = \\left[ \\displaystyle \\frac { C \\sin { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } + D \\cos { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } } { \\left( \\sin { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( \\cos { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\right] \\hfill } } \\\\ { { D e l t a Y = \\left[ \\displaystyle\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME” (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME”\n\nContent: \\frac { C \\sin { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } - D \\cos { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } } { \\left( \\sin { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( \\cos { \\left( \\Theta \\right) } \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\right] \\hfill } } \\end{array} $$ where $C$ and $D$ , the adjusted site 1 coordinates in a rotation-adjusted coordinate system, are calculated, for example, using the formulas: $$ \\begin{array} { r } { C = y A 1 - ( ( x N 1 \\ \\sin \\Theta ) + ( ( y N 1 \\ \\cos \\Theta ) } \\\\ { D = x A 1 - ( ( x N 1 \\ \\cos \\Theta ) - ( ( y N 1 \\ \\sin \\Theta ) } \\end{array} $$ The equipment can also calculate a ScaleFactor term to indicate the relative ratio between the length of the vector connecting the nominal alignment sites and the length of the vector connecting the actual alignment sites. This can be used, for example, to judge whether there is a problem with the alignment process, since the difference between these two vectors should be small. $$ S c a l e F a c t o r = \\frac { V A } { V N } $$ where $V A$ and $V N$ are the length of the vectors connecting\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME” (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # “ALIGNNAME”\n\nContent: the actual and nominal alignment sites, calculated using the formulas: $$ \\begin{array} { l c r } { { V N = \\sqrt { \\left( y N _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } - y N _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( x N _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } - x N _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } } } \\\\ { { V A = \\sqrt { \\left( y A _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } - y A _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( x A _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } - x A _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } } } \\end{array} $$ M20/M2OP COORDINATE SYSTEMS EXAMPLE (EXAGGERATED)\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # RELATED INFORMATION 2 APPLICATION NOTES\n\nNOTE: The material contained in these Application Notes is not an official part of SEMI E30.1 and is not intended to modify or supersede the official standard.

The ISEM Variable Item Dictionary (Table 4) includes seven data items intended to be used for this purpose. They are identified with the comment “This information may be added by the host in the ISEM Tables.” Identifying the value of variable data items in Table attributes is not covered in use of ISEM Tables. One method to accomplish this is to use attribute identifiers (ATTRIDn) that are the same identifiers that are used for the equipment variable data items (Table R2-1). (This is very similar to the method specified in Section 12.5 to identify values to override the default values of variable process program parameters using the “PPSELECT” remote commands).  \nTable R2-1  ISEM Variable Items and Their Equivalent ISEM Table Attribute Identifiers  \nNOTE 1: The variable item may be identified using any appropriate SECS II data item forma\n\nSEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R2-2  Example ISEM Table with Item Attributes That Specify ISEM Variable Values Using S13,F13 Table Data Send (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.1-0200 INSPECTION AND REVIEW SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL (ISEM) - # R2-2  Example ISEM Table with Item Attributes That Specify ISEM Variable Values Using S13,F13 Table Data Send\n\nContent: R2-2.1 Typical values for Data Items are indicated.

Values of these variables shall be available to the host via collection event reports and host status queries. 9.2 Requirement all generic variable data items defined in SEMI E30 are required by all Measurement equipment. Data item variables are categorized as follows: 9.2.1 Common Variables $( C V )$ variables common to all equipment of the class being addressed. These variables are covered in Table 4 and must be used to regardless of the measurement tool type. 9.2.2 Configuration-specific variables (CSV) variables associated with a specific configuration of the above equipment class. 9.2.2.1 The following rules should be adhered to in the reporting of these variables. • The information should be sent using the corresponding formats defined on Table 4 and 5. • For ASCII variables A[n]. If the actual data does not fill the entire field, blanks shall be used to complete the field. For ASCII variables A[1..n].\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 9  Data Item Variables (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 9  Data Item Variables\n\nContent: All fields should be left justified. 9.3 Since MSEM is generic to all equipment it tries not to specify the names of the measurement variables to be sent to the host. MSEM does require that the data be reported at site, wafer and lot levels. It should include the option of reporting data at the individual scan level if supported by the equipment. It is a requirement that the equipment report at least: max, min, mean, standard deviation. Additional statistic calculations may be added by the equipment supplier. For each type of data collected by the equipment at the site level; the data must be summarized and available for reporting at the wafer and lot levels. 9.4 The following rules should be applied when reporting measurement values taken by the tool.

The value of the equipment constant may be queried by the host at any time using the S2F13/14 transaction.  \n9.6.2  Status Variables (SV) — are valid at all times. A SV may not be changed by the host but may be changed by the equipment or the operator. The value of status variables may be queried by the host at anytime using the S1F3/4 or S6F19/20 transactions.  \n9.6.3  Data Variables (DVVAL)  are variables which are valid only upon occurrence of specific collection events. An attempt to read a data variable at the wrong time shall not generate an error, but the data reported may not have relevant meaning.  \n9.6.4  Variable Data (V)  this is a class of variable data which includes all the previously defined types of variables.  \nTable 4  Data Item Variable List\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 9.6.5  Data Item Sub-variable List\n\nTable 5  Data Item Sub-Variable List\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 10  Alarm List\n\n10.1  Since each model of equipment differs in configuration, it is not practical to provide an exhaustive list of all possible alarms.  Instead, the MSEM is requiring the two tables provided as described in SEMI E30 (Document Section).  Alarm List Table which is intended to provide for equipment configuration specific alarms and Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 10.2  Alarm List Table\n\n10.2.1  The alarm list table contains examples of alarms that pertain to various configurational aspects of equipment. These examples are intended to illustrate that alarms pertain to situations in which there exists a potential for exceeding physical safety limits associated with people, equipment, and material being processed as per the SEMI E30 definition of an alarm. See SEMI E30 for further reference.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 10.3  Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event Table\n\n10.3.1  The Alarm ID, Alarm Set/Cleared Event table documents  the association of each ALID to a set and cleared event as required by SEMI E30. See SEMI E30 for further reference.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11  Process Program Management\n\n11.1  Requirements  The MSEM requires that the SEMI E30 capability of Process Program Management be fully supported for this class of equipment.  The MSEM is also requiring that the Process Program have a structure that enables the user to build Process Programs with default conditions that can be overridden for a run. MSEM is requiring the ability to vary; the quantity of substrates measured, the alignment information used and the number and/or location of the sites to be measured through the uses of Process Program variable parameters.  The concepts of Process Program Structure and Process Program variable parameters are discussed in the following sections.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure\n\nContent: 11.2.1 Definition and Rules for Process Programs A Process Program contains information and/or instructions required for the metrology equipment to process a given run of material. Equipment constants can be used to supplement the information contained in a Process Program. 11.2.1.1 The Process Program shall supply all of the information required for a remotely executed run to be processed without operator intervention. Any information that is normally requested from the operator console in manual operation shall have default values assigned in the body of the Process Program. 11.2.1.2 Process-program parameters are used to tailor a specific run of material and do not permanently modify the Process Program. They will remain in effect only until the next run or until the next PPUPDATE or PP-SELECT, PP-ASSIGN remote command. 11.2.1.3 MSEM is requiring the ability to define specific Process Program variable parameters to; define what substrates are to be measured (Process SlotList), what sites are to be measured\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure\n\nContent: (SiteList or M21SiteList) and what aligns are used by the Process Program (AlignList or M21AlignList). If the MSEM equipment is using the SEMI M21 coordinate system then an additional Process Program variable parameter is required what elements are to be measured (ElementList). 11.2.2 Definition of Process Program Variable Parameters A process-program parameter specifies a value that temporarily modifies the value of a variable parameter in a Process Program. A variable parameter is formally defined within a process-program body and contains: a variable parameter name that is unique in the body a parameter initial value, known as default value, for use when the Process Program is selected for execution without specification of an override value for this variable parameter. 11.2.3 The Equipment may also support the definition including: a parameter restriction that represents one or more conditions that any value specified for the parameter must satisfy. a CP-NAME in a remote command must be identical to a\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure\n\nContent: variable parameter name in the Process Program specified in the remote command. If the Equipment allows Sub-process Programs, a Sub-process Program reference may also specify parameters. 11.2.4 Relationship of Process Program Variable Parameter The PP-SELECT, PP-ASSIGN or PPUPDATE remote commands can be used to modify variables within the Process Program. The modification to process-program variables is done by using CP-NAME/CP-VAL pairs within the command. 11.2.5 Sub-Process Programs Equipment may allow a main Process Program to reference Sub-process Programs. A main Process Program is one that can be referenced by the host. A Sub-process Program is a Process Program that is referenced by a main Process Program or by other Sub-process Programs. No Sub-process Program may reference its main Process Program. If the Equipment supports sub-process-program references, it must be possible for the host to determine which Sub-process Programs are referenced in all Process Programs. 11.2.5.1 Before execution of a main\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2   Process Program Structure\n\nContent: Process Program can begin, the presence of all the Sub-process Programs that it references must be verified by the Equipment. If they are not all present, an error collection event must occur. It must be possible to include in the event report which Sub-process Programs are missing. For a formatted Process Program, the error is reported using an S7F27 message.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2.6  Component Descriptions and Allowed Formats (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2.6  Component Descriptions and Allowed Formats\n\nContent: Table 6 Process Program Component Description and Format Table 11.2.7 DEF-LIST-TABLE Description DEF-LIST types of tables are used by the equipment in conjunction with the Process Programs. The DEF-LIST table structures provide a means to transfer to equipment a list of a particular type of information. The DEF-LIST table structures are used by the host to send information to equipment for later use in association with a Process Program. Each DEF-LIST that is sent has a unique Table name and each list element in the DEF-LIST has several components including a name (Site-Name, or Align-Name) as well as other components. A specific list row can be accessed for use with a specific Process Program by giving the DEF-LIST table name and the specific row name. 11.2.7.1 There are five types of DEF-LIST tables: SITE-DEF-LIST: A list of Sites and their attributes, typically the list of sites to be measured. ALIGN-DEF-LIST: A list of alignment sites and their attributes. M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST: A list of\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2.6  Component Descriptions and Allowed Formats (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 11.2.6  Component Descriptions and Allowed Formats\n\nContent: element ID and their low left hand location in M20P or SEMI M20 coordinates. M21-ELEMENT-SITE-DEF-LIST: A list of ElementID's and what sites are to be measured within that element. • M21-ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST: a list of ElementID's and the alignment sites to be used at each. NOTE 2: The attributes are equipment-defined. 11.2.7.2 To support the SiteList, and AlignList, for SEMI M20, M20P and SEMI M21, the following types of tables must be implemented: SITE-DEF-LIST, ALIGN-DEF-LIST, or M21-ELEMENT-SITE- DEF-LIST, M21- ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST and M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST. A host would send a DEF-LIST to equipment using standard transfer methods for tables as defined by ARAMS (SEMI E58). MSEM requires that the following columns be included in the DEF-LIST tables. The DEF-LIST-TABLE components table defines the DEF-LIST column names and their allowable format is given below.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # Table 7  SITE-DEF-LIST\n\n11.2.7.3  For SEMI M21 Coordinate system an additional table is required.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # Table 8  M21-ELEMENT-SITE-DEF-LIST\n\nTable 9  M21-ELEMENT-DEF-LIST\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # Table 10   ALIGN-DEF-LIST\n\nTable 11  M21-ELEMENT-ALIGN-DEF-LIST\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12  Remote Commands\n\n12.1  The purpose of this section is to identify the MSEM required remote commands, command parameters, and valid commands versus MSEM states.  \n12.2  Requirements  The following capabilities are required:  \nStartProcessing\nStop Processing\nTemporaly Suspend Processing\nResume Processing\nAbort Processing\nSelect Process Programs, Material and/or Sites to\nMeasure\nReport Location of Material Found within a\ncassette  \n12.3  All the remote commands defined by MSEM are required unless they have been qualified by the statement “if the equipment supports this functionality it shall use this command”. Then, they are only required if the equipment supports the functionality necessary to support the command.  A good example of this is the MAP-CASSETTE command if the equipment does not have the hardware necessary to scan a cassette for the presence of substrates in slots then the command is not required by the MSEM. The alphanumeric strings defined by MSEM for RCMD and CPNAME are required.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions\n\nContent: 12.4.1 Host Command Parameter (CPNAME/CPVAL) — a parameter name/value associated with a particular host command (S2,F49). This document will specify unique names (CPNAMEs) and values (CPVALs) for many command parameters. Note that if there are no associated parameters a zero-length list is sent. 12.5 Remote Commands Description — this section describes required functionality, suppliers may implement additional commands. The following remote commands (RCMDs) must be supported as described below. NOTE 2: The terms “current cycle” and “safe point” used below are to be defined by the supplier. 12.5.1 ABORT terminate the current cycle prior to its completion. Abort has the intent of immediately stopping the process and is used because of abnormal conditions. Abort makes no guarantee about the subsequent condition of material except as noted in the CPNAME ABORT-LEVEL description. 12.5.2 CLEANUP Process Program deselection, removal of all material to output locations and any equipment specific activities needed to transition into the\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions\n\nContent: IDLE state. Completion of this command should generate a collection event report. 12.5.3 NEXT-MATERIAL processing of the current substrate is halted at the first safe point and unloaded to the target cassette location. Next-material has the intent of allowing the host to skip measurement of the current substrate. This is a trigger for processing state transition from WORKING to UNLOAD. 12.5.4 PAUSE suspend processing temporarily at the next safe point. Pause has the intent of resuming the process at the same point where it was paused. RESUME or PP-UPDATE may be used to resume the process. 12.5.5 PP-ASSIGN instructs the equipment to assign a process to a carrier ID(s)/location(s) and place the exchange station in the process queue with the given priority. Only one assignment is allowed for a exchange station. Without specifying a priority, the material is queued with the default priority. Material with equal priority are queued in the order the PP-ASSIGN commands are received. If the equipment supports the functionality of\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions\n\nContent: queuing material, it will use this command. 12.5.6 PP-SELECT instructs the equipment to make the requested Process Program(s) available in the execution area. Additionally, to reduce the number of Process Programs on the equipment, PP-SELECT may define the material to be measured, measurement site locations, and/or the information needed for site alignment; default values shall be used if this information is not specified. This is a trigger for the processing state transition from IDLE to SETTING UP. All Process Programs specified in the command are to be validated 12.5.7 PP-UPDATE provides the ability to alter Process Program variables during the PAUSED processing state. Any CPNAMEs specified in PPUPDATE will replace the previous definitions. This command will RESUME the process. If the PPUPDATE fails, the Process Program variables present prior to the PP-UPDATE are retained. If no parameters values are specified, the defaults are used. 12.5.8 RESUME resume processing from the point where the process was paused. This is the\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.4  Definitions\n\nContent: trigger for processing state transition 10, from PROCESS PAUSE. 12.5.9 START instructs the equipment to initiate processing. This is the trigger for the processing state transition from READY to LOAD. 12.5.10 STOP complete the current cycle, stop in a safe condition and return to the IDLE processing state. Stop has the intent of stopping the process entirely. The equipment is not required to support the continuation of processing.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 12.6  Host Command Parameters Names (CPNAME)\n\nTable 12  Host Command Parameter Table  \n12.7  Remote Commands and Associated Host Command Parameters  This table describes the allowable command parameters  (CPNAME) for each remote command (RCMD).

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on April 30, 2001. R1-1. Measurement Site Location Metrology equipment most often is used to make measurements and report results at specific sites on a substrate. Unfortunately, equipment suppliers and users have adopted different formats for describing measurement site location information. This has led to three problems which increase the cost of metrology. First, metrology equipment suppliers must provide formats which meet conflicting requirements of their customers, adding to equipment development costs. Second, users must transpose information from different systems to their own format in order to use metrology data. Third, site location information is often an integral part of recipe set up, often requiring that an actual product sample be\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES\n\nContent: available for “training” the site location information on the equipment. For users who manufacture many different products on common substrates, multiple metrology “recipes” must be developed where the only differences are site location information. This information is known to the user from product design data, and should not need to be \"learned\" uniquely on various metrology equipment. R1-1.1 In order to avoid these problems, MSEM defines specific formats for identifying and reporting site location information on substrates. The MSEM-required formats are intended to minimize the number and type of site location format transformations needing to be supported by both metrology equipment suppliers and users. All MSEM-required site location formats involve the use of an MSEM-defined right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, established on substrates in an MSEM-defined manner. This release of MSEM defines these only for silicon wafer substrates, based on SEMI standard M20. Additional substrate types\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES\n\nContent: may be included in future revisions of MSEM, if required. R1-1.2 MSEM requires that equipment have the capability to use site location information that is based on the user's product designs, which the user must provide in the appropriate MSEM-required format. In other words, equipment shall not require that a sample substrate be used to “train” site locations when users can provide this information from product design data. R1-1.3 MSEM-compliant equipment shall have the capability to define, locate, measure, and report site information using only the MSEM-defined right-handed Cartesian coordinate system formats. This requirement does not preclude equipment from having additional capability for defining or reporting site location information using other formats. One such additional format is defined in MSEM for patterned silicon wafer substrates, based on SEMI standard SEMI M21. MSEM-compliant equipment is not required to have this “M21” format capability, but must use the MSEM “M21” format if it is\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 SEM UNIQUE CAPABILITIES\n\nContent: provided. R1-1.4 Specific MSEM information that defines site location information includes ; the data items AlignList and SiteList; the CPNAMEs CP-ALIGNLIST and CP-SITELIST and the TABLE type named ALIGNDEF-LIST and SITE-DEF-LIST. Notice that multiple sites can first be Defined using the appropriate Process Program class named ALIGN-DEF-LIST or SITEDEF-LIST, then selected by using the ALIGN-NAME or SITENAME in an MSEM defined remote command that use CP-ALIGNLIST AND CP-SITELIST. This information is similarly defined for the “M21” coordinate system plus an additional CPNAME of ELEMENTLIST which lists the ElementIDs to be measured on the silicon wafers.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: R1-2.1 Requirements MSEM defines two right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems for use on silicon wafers. These are identified as the $\\mathrm { ^ { 6 6 } M 2 0 ^ { 3 } }$ and $\\mathrm { \\bf { \\dot { \\tau } } M } 2 0 \\mathrm { \\bf P ^ { \\prime } }$ coordinate systems. Both are based on SEMI standard M20. The SEMI M20 standard describes how to map a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system to a wafer so that its origin is at the center of the wafer, and its negative y-axis bisects the wafer's primary fiducial. This coordinate system is defined by MSEM to be the $\\mathbf { \\ddot { M } } 2 0 ^ { , , }$ coordinate system. MSEM defines the $\" \\mathrm { { M } } 2 0 \\mathrm { { P } \" }$ coordinate systems to be one which is aligned to the pattern on the wafer. Ideally, there is no difference between the $\\mathrm { ^ { 6 4 } M 2 0 P ^ { \\mathrm { 3 } } }$ and “M20” coordinate system. In the real world, there is a difference, due to experimental errors. This is explained further in the following sections.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: R1-2.2 Implementation The only information required by equipment in order to establish an $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\omega } _ { M 2 0 } } \\mathbf { \\vec { \\omega } }$ coordinate system is the wafer size and type of fiducial. This is provided by way of the MSEM data items named WaferSize and Fiducial. Another data item named Orientation provides for control over how the wafer is loaded on equipment. Note that the SEMI M20 standard requires that the $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\omega } } ^ { \\mathbf { \\omega } _ { \\mathbf { M } 2 0 } \\mathbf { \\vec { \\omega } } ^ { \\mathbf { * } } }$ coordinate system is fixed on the wafer, and is not affected by how the wafer is loaded on equipment. Also, as stated in the SEMI M20 standard, an orientation of $\\ \" 0 \\ : \"$ is for a wafer loaded on equipment with the primary fiducial towards the operator or “down”. R1-2.2.1 Often, no other information is required for measurements to be made on a wafer. However, the $\\mathbf { \\cdot } \\mathbf { M } 2 0 ^ { \\mathbf { \\cdot } }$\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: coordinate system may not provide sufficient accuracy to locate measurement sites on patterned wafers. This is a result of any of a number of possible reasons, all of which can be described as “experimental errors”. For instance, wafers are not perfectly round, fiducial dimensions may vary, and equipment (both steppers that place patterns on wafers and metrology equipment) capabilities to determine the location of the wafer center and fiducial vary. R1-2.2.2 In order to deal with these errors, metrology equipment suppliers have developed various strategies, as discussed in the introduction section. Perhaps because the SEMI M20 standard's reference to “origins” of “other coordinate systems” is in the same sentence with “reference points”, many suppliers adopted the location of one (or more) reference point(s) as the origin for their pattern-based coordinate system(s). Without a common reference site, multiple coordinate systems resulted. More nefarious strategies were developed to compensate for\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: “stage errors” on equipment. These usually entail a series of reference points required to “zero in” on the measurement site, and this made comparison of locations determined on different equipment next to impossible. R1-2.2.3 MSEM defines the “M20P” coordinate system to be one which is identical to the “M20” coordinate system, if there were no experimental errors. In other words, the location of the origin and axes of the “M20P” coordinate system are offset slightly from the origin and axes of the $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\omega } _ { M 2 0 } } \\mathbf { \\vec { \\omega } }$ coordinate system because of experimental errors. If the location of reference points, called “alignment sites” in MSEM, is defined to be the $\" \\mathbf { M } 2 0 \"$ coordinates where they are “expected” to be, and equipment is designed to be able to “find” the alignment sites, given the various possible experimental errors, the “found” and “expected” SEMI M20 coordinates can be used to determine the “M20-to-M20P” coordinate system\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: transformation, as explained in appendix 1. Alignment site information is specified through the use of the MSEM data items named AlignList, the CPNAME CP-ALIGNLIST and, the table type named ALIGN-DEF-LIST. R1-2.2.4 Most metrology equipment cannot distinguish whether patterned wafer site location errors are due to the wafer, the layout on the wafer, or the equipment's ability to locate the sites. However, information that is available through the use of patterned-wafer alignment sites can provide a means for identifying potential metrology equipment problems. For instance, assume that the only pattern-layout location error on a wafer is that due to the establishment of the location of the wafer center and fiducial. For many users and metrology systems, this is a good assumption. If this is the case, then the MSEM data item named XlateData can be used to track this error. Although the error may result from multiple sources, being able to track it on various metrology equipment will enable users to\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: apply statistical process control techniques to identify the specific sources. R1-2.2.5 Sites specified for measurements or additional alignments may be found by metrology equipment at locations which deviate from their expected locations through either pattern layout errors or metrology equipment “stage” errors. Again, in a controlled manufacturing process, these combined errors should be normally distributed, and non-normal deviations may indicate possible metrology equipment problems. These types of errors shall be reported through the use of the MSEM data item named Offset. R1-2.2.6 A minimum of two alignment sites are necessary to establish an “M20P” coordinate system on a wafer. Additional sites are often used, as in the example given in appendix 1. The system supplier shall document the requirements for ALIGNLIST information, and detail how any “site-by-site” alignment sites (that is, those needed to obtain better location accuracy in the neighborhood of measurement site) are associated with\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: the specific SITELIST measurement sites. R1-2.2.7 Alignment site location information may be either provided to or by equipment. Some equipment have the capability to find and report the locations of “reference sites” without prior knowledge of their locations on the wafer. In this case, the equipment shall report the location of both alignment and measurement sites in $\\mathbf { \\dot { \\vec { \\tau } } } \\mathbf { M } 2 0 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ coordinates. When alignment site information is provided to equipment to establish an $\\mathrm { \\bf { \\dot { \\omega } } } ^ { \\mathrm { \\bf { \\epsilon } } } \\mathbf { M } 2 0 \\mathrm { \\bf { P } } ^ { \\mathrm { \\bf { \\prime } } }$ coordinate, measurement site locations shall be reported in the $\\mathrm { \\bf { \\dot { \\omega } M } } 2 0 \\mathrm { \\bf { P } } ^ { \\mathrm { \\bf { \\prime } } }$ coordinate system. R1-2.2.8 MSEM encourages users to define “M20P” locations in reference to the user's device layout design within an ideal SEMI M20 wafer coordinate\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: system. An alternative is to define “M20P” locations by “training” on a “benchmark” system. R1-3 Layout of Rectangular Elements on a Silicon Wafer Equipment shall be capable of routine, automated operation without needing wafer layout information (e.g., field or die maps). However, having the capability to provide wafer layout information to metrology equipment from the host can be desirable. In some cases, the amount of information required to define measurement site locations is less if a pattern-element-based format is used. MSEM defines a means to do this in this section, if desired, based on SEMI standard SEMI M21. R1-3.1 SEMI standard SEMI M21, “Specification for assigning addresses to rectangular elements in a Cartesian array”, is limited (for MSEM purposes) by the fact that nothing is specified about how the rectangular elements are located on the wafer. The SEMI M21 standard details how to assign “addresses” to elements and how to find the “array center” element. In this section, MSEM\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: defines how these elements are located on a wafer, using the data item named “M21Data”, and how to establish within-element coordinate systems. R1-3.2 There are users who want or require much more layout information than is provided for by SEMI M21, such as within-element structure details or element attribute information. This additional layout information is beyond the scope of MSEM, since it is considered to be information which only is needed to aid operator-interactive use of metrology systems. R1-3.3 MSEM “M21” Layout The first pattern element layout issue to be addressed is that of determining which SEMI M21 elements are to be included in the MSEM “M21” layout. MSEM defines the “M21” layout to include all elements which either wholly or partially are within the circumference of the wafer. Thus the MSEM “M21” element layout does not correspond to the pattern layout exactly, since some “M21” elements may not contain patterns. R1-3.4 The second layout issue is that of how best to specify the\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: element locations on the wafer. The MSEM approach is to specify the $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ \\stackrel { . . } { M } } 2 0 \\mathrm { \\bf P } ^ { \\prime }$ coordinate for the lower left corner of the minimum number of elements needed to define the layout, along with the element addresses. For a non-tiled layout, the location of a single element is sufficient to establish the “M21” layout. For tiled layouts, the location of one element in each row or column is required. Note that the location of the lower left corner of an element may be outside the circumference of the wafer. R1-3.5 Layout definition is supported only for host-to-equipment communications. The user is responsible for ensuring that the element addresses provided to the equipment agree with the SEMI M21 specification. The equipment need not check this, other than to ensure that there are not conflicts within the provided layout, and shall report results with element addresses as provided by the user. R1-3.6 M21 layouts are established within\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-2   Coordinate Systems For A Silicon Wafer\n\nContent: the “M20P” coordinate system, and need not require any additional alignment site data than is needed to establish the “M20P” coordinate system. However, as with $\\mathrm { ^ { 6 6 } M 2 0 P ^ { \\prime } }$ , additional alignment may be necessary because of errors in either the pattern layout or the equipment's ability to locate features. OFFSET shall be used to report the location corrections that result from any within-element alignments. R1-3.7 MSEM provides a means for element-based coordinate systems, if required. This capability is provided by the option of specifying “M21” as the coordinate system for ALIGN-DEF-DATA and SITEDEFDATA items. For element-based site locations, MSEM requires that SEMI M21 element coordinate systems have x and y axes parallel to the respective M20-based coordinate system axes, with their origins at the lower left corner of each element.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4  An Example of How an M20P Coordinate System is Established on a Silicon Wafer\n\nR1-4.1  The following example is fairly basic.  For this example, the equipment does M20P alignment via a repeated two-step process.  The first step is done at a low resolution, the second at a high resolution, and the process is done at two positions on the wafer.  \nR1-4.2  The equipment documentation states that 4 alignment sites are required.  These are defined to the equipment via the table type named ALIGN-DEFLIST, as detailed below.  The order of the sites in ALIGN-DEF-LIST is not important.  The sites are then selected via the CPNAME item named CP-ALIGNLIST, which is included in the PP-SELECT command. The order of the sites listed in CP-ALIGNLIST is important, and is as specified in the equipment's documentation.  The first site is the alignment site for the first low resolution site, the second item is for the first high resolution site, the third item is the second low resolution site, and the fourth is the second high resolution site.\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST\n\nContent: L,4 1. <Coarse1> 2. <Fine1> 3. <Coarse 2> 4. <Fine2> R1-4.4 Using this information, the equipment will go to the nominal M20 location for Coarse, then “find” where it actually is. The offset between the nominal M20 location and the actual M20 location is then used to “find” Fine1. The actual M20 location of Fine1 is saved. The process is then repeated for Coarse 2 and Fine2. The equipment can now determine the M20 to M20P offset from the nominal and actual coordinates. First, a summary of the data: $\\mathtt { x N 1 = - 6 0 0 2 0 }$ $\\mathtt { y N 1 } { = } { - } 2 0 5$ Nominal x and y data for the first fine site xA1=-59800 $\\scriptstyle \\operatorname { y A l } = - 1 5 0$ Actual $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ and y data for the first fine site $\\mathrm { x N } 2 { = } 5 9 9 8 0$ $\\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { N } 2 { = } 1 9 5$ Nominal x and y data for the second fine site $\\mathrm { x A } 2 { = } 6 0 0 6 0$ $\\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { A } 2 \\mathbf { = } 1 7 5$ Actual $\\mathbf { X }$ and y data for the second fine site R1-4.5\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST\n\nContent: The equipment first calculates THETA ${ \\bf \\Xi } ( \\Theta )$ , using, for example, the formula: $$ \\Theta { = } \\mathrm { t a n } ^ { - 1 } \\Bigg [ \\frac { M A - M N } { 1 + M A M N } \\Bigg ] $$ where MA and MN are, respectively, the slopes of the lines connecting the nominal and actual fine sites, in M20 coordinates, calculated as follows: $$ M A = \\left[ { \\frac { y A _ { 2 } - y A _ { 1 } } { x A _ { 2 } - x A _ { 1 } } } \\right] M N = \\left[ { \\frac { y N _ { 2 } - y N _ { 1 } } { x N _ { 2 } - x N _ { 1 } } } \\right] $$ R1-4.6 The equipment then calculates DELTAX and DELTAY, using, for example, the formulas: $$ \\begin{array} { c } { { D E L T A X = \\left[ \\displaystyle \\frac { C s i n \\left( \\Theta \\right) + D c o s \\left( \\Theta \\right) } { \\left( s i n \\left( \\Theta \\right) \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( c o s \\left( \\Theta \\right) \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\right] } } \\\\ { { { } } } \\\\ { { D E L T A Y = \\left[ \\displaystyle \\frac { C s i n \\left( \\Theta \\right) - D c o s \\left( \\Theta \\right) } { \\left( s i n \\left( \\Theta\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # R1-4.3  ALIGN-DEF-LIST\n\nContent: \\right) \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( c o s \\left( \\Theta \\right) \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\right] } } \\end{array} $$ Where $\\mathbf { C }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ are the adjusted site 1 coordinates in a rotation-adjusted coordinate system calculated, for example, using the formulas: $$ \\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { C } = \\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { A } \\mathbf { l } - ( ( \\mathbf { x } \\mathbf { N } \\mathbf { l } \\sin \\Theta ) + ( ( \\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { N } \\mathbf { l } \\cos \\Theta ) } \\\\ { \\mathbf { D } = \\mathbf { x } \\mathbf { A } \\mathbf { l } - ( ( \\mathbf { x } \\mathbf { N } \\mathbf { l } \\cos \\Theta ) - ( ( \\mathbf { y } \\mathbf { N } \\mathbf { l } \\sin \\Theta ) } \\end{array} $$ R1-4.7 The equipment can also calculate a SCALEFACTOR term to indicate the relative difference between the length of the vector connecting the nominal alignment sites and the length of the vector connecting the actual alignment sites.

The standardization of the transfer process is critical to the economic viability of material movement automation. This standard addresses the communications needs of the semiconductor manufacturing facility with respect to material movement. 1.1 Purpose — This standard addr esses automated material movement on the semiconductor factory floor—the task of transporting objects (material, et al) from one processing or storage location to another. It defines the concepts of material movement, the behavior of the equipment (including transfer devices) in relation to material movement, and the messaging services which are needed to accomplish the task. 1.2 Scope — The scope of this sta ndard is defined from two viewpoints. The first is the breadth of the functionality covered. The second is the depth to which it is covered. The breadth of functionality covered by this standard is limited to the activity\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 1  Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: required to transfer an object from a location on entity “A” to a location on entity “B” under the supervision of a factory host. This transfer may occur directly between two factory process equipment, or may involve the assistance of a “transfer agent”, a device dedicated to material transfer. Thus, the material movement domain includes a maximum of four types of entities (see Figure 1.1): 1. The factory host, which might, for example, be a factory controller or cell controller. 2. The set of process-related equipment, to which the host communicates. 3. The transfer agent, which performs the physical transport of the material in the factory. The transfer agent might communicate directly with the host or be controlled by an intermediate system. 4. This intermediate system, the transfer system controller, is the fourth type of entity. This document assumes that the transfer system controller is either a part of the host or a part of a potentially complex transfer agent (as shown by the dotted boxes in Figure 1.1). Thus, the term\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 1  Introduction (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: “transfer system controller” seldom appears. The case where a “transfer agent” is actually a transfer system controller plus multiple transport devices is discussed further in Section 4.1.6. There are some forms of material movement that do not fall within the domain of this standard and thus are not applicable to the methods described below. One example might be a non-deterministic system, such as a conveyer where generic parts are placed onto the system and circle until randomly selected by a workstation needing that type of part. The subject of alarm reporting is not covered in this document. While material movement-related alarm situations will exist, the definition of the mechanism for reporting such alarms is left to other standards documents. This standard presents a solution from the concepts and behavior down to the messaging services. It does not define the messaging protocol. A messaging service includes the identification that a message shall be exchanged and definition of the data contained within that message. It\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 1  Introduction (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 1  Introduction\n\nContent: does not include information on the structure of the message, how the data is represented within the message, or how the message is exchanged. This additional information is contained with the message protocol. The defined services may be applied to multiple protocols. Information on the mapping of material movement services to specific protocols (e.g., SECS-II) are added as adjunct standards. 1.3 References — The following S EMI standards are related to the Material Movement standard: SEMI E5 — SEMI Equipment Communications Standard 2 Message Content (SECS-II) SEMI E23 — Specification for Cassette Transfer Parallel I/O Interface SEMI E30 — Generic Model for Communications and Control of SEMI Equipment (GEM) SEMI E39 — Object Services Standard: Concepts, Behavior, and Services Other References: created uses a copy of the same state model.

Some are defined using terms defined elsewhere within this section. Please reference such definitions as needed. No references beyond this section should be necessary for a basic understanding of these terms. Active Transfer Partner — (Opposite of Passive Transfer Partner) A transfer partner is considered active when it physically participates in the micro level portion of the transfer, either by moving the transfer object or by moving impediments within the transfer envelope (e.g., doors, clamps). This term refers to the micro level transfer phase only, and not to any setup activities prior to the transfer (e.g., a port door may be opened during setup phase by passive partner). Atomic Transfer — The basic unit of movement. The transfer of a single transfer object from Equipment A directly to Equipment B where only one change in ownership occurs. Compound Transfer — Combination of two or more atomic transfers executed sequentially or concurrently to achieve a single\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions\n\nContent: goal (e.g., exchange carriers or move a carrier between process machines using a transfer agent). Dynamic Port — (Opposite of Static Port) A port with associated mechanisms capable of assisting with the physical movement of a transfer object or of interfering with the transfer of an object during the transfer. Such mechanisms may include doors, elevators, and robot arms. A transfer partner using a dynamic port for the transfer may be active or passive as required. NOTE 1: The concepts of “dynamic” and “static” are associated with a port rather than equipment, as equipment may have both dynamic and static ports. Equipment — Mechanical entity in the factory which plays a role in the manufacturing process. The equipment referenced in this document include machines used for processing, transport, and/or storage of material (see definition of material). Host — In the context of material movement, the host is an entity, generally separate from either transfer partner, which coordinates and supervises a transfer job. Interactive\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions\n\nContent: Transfer — A transfer in which both partners are active and must interact in the performance of the transfer. Interfering — A dynamic port is interfering when any of its associated mechanisms are positioned where they are capable of physically obstructing the transfer. Macro Level — Level of material movement that involves coordination by the host but may not require knowledge of the physical process used to accomplish the material transfer. Material — A term used interchangeably with “transfer object” to refer to discrete objects which may be transferred to and from equipment. This may include product, carriers, reusable fixtures, etc. See transfer object definition. Material Location — A physical position on a piece of equipment at which a transfer object may reside. Many material locations may be accessed directly through a port, but this is not a requirement. Some material locations internal to the equipment may not be accessible by a transfer agent. Message Service/Service — A service (or a message service) represents a set\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions\n\nContent: of functions offered to a user by a provider. An unconfirmed service consists of a sequence of service primitives — the request from the sender to the communications facility and an indication to the receiver from the communications facility. Each of these service primitives is described by a list of parameters. A confirmed service adds a response to the initial request. The primitives for a response are called the response and the confirmation. A service excludes definition of message structure and protocol. Micro Level — Level of material movement characterized by peer-to-peer interaction of the transfer partners to achieve synchronization of the detailed mechanical steps of material transfer. Object — Webster's defines an object as “something perceptible.” In the software world, an object is a combination of attributes and behavior. It may refer to something concrete, such as a transfer object, or to a concept, such as a transfer job. Ownership — An equipment is said to “own” a transfer object from the time the object is\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions\n\nContent: transferred into one of its ports until it is transferred out of the equipment. This indicates that the equipment has physical control of the transfer object. Passive Transfer — A transfer that involves one active and one passive partner. During a passive transfer, the active partner retains control of the transfer envelope during the entire physical transfer. Passive Transfer Partner — (Opposite of Active Transfer Partner) A transfer partner is considered passive when it takes no part in the physical micro level transfer, moving nothing within the transfer envelope. This term refers to the physical micro level transfer phase only. Setup activities prior to the transfer may be performed by a Passive Transfer Partner (e.g., a port door may be opened during setup phase). Port — A point on the equipment at which a change of equipment ownership of a transfer object occurs. A port is not itself a material location, but shall have an associated location. A port may be thought of as an access point to an a material location on an\n\nSEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E30.5-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR METROLOGY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT MODEL - # 2  Definitions\n\nContent: equipment. The definition of the term port includes any dedicated mechanisms that either prepare for, facilitate, or are capable of interfering with the transfer. All equipment shall have a minimum of one port. NOTE 2: While they are of use to the host system, the commonly used designations “Input Port” and “Output Port” are irrelevant in the context of this document. They are based on a flow of material through an equipment rather than the movement of transfer objects (which may be carriers rather than the material itself). Transfer objects may have to be moved into and out of both these types of ports. Receiving Port — For a specific transfer, the port into which a transfer object is to be placed. Sending Port — For a specific transfer, the port from which a transfer object is to be removed. Static Port — (Opposite of Dynamic Port) A port with no associated mechanisms capable of assisting or interfering with the transfer of an object. A transfer partner utilizing a static port for the transfer shall always be passive.

Transfer Envelope — The three-dimensional space occupied during the transfer by the transfer object and all associated transfer mechanisms of both transfer partners. This defines the space in which transfer activity occurs and in which the potential for physical interference with the transfer exists. Transfer Job The set of atomic transfers constructed by the host to accomplish a cohesive material movement objective. See the section on compound transfers below. Transfer Object A physical object that is transferred to and from equipment, such as a product material, an empty carrier, or a carrier containing material to be processed. Tools (e.g., stepper reticles) and expendable materials also may be transfer objects. The term “material” is used interchangeably with “transfer object.” Transfer Partners — In a given atomic transfer, the equipment sending a transfer object and the equipment receiving the transfer object are",
