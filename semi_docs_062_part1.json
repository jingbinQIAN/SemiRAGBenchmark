Originally published in 1995.\n\nSEMI D12-95 (Reapproved 0703) SPECIFICATION FOR EDGE CONDITION OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAY (FPD) SUBSTRATES - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  This document defines various aspects of the edges of a flat panel display substrate and describes their relationships.

Publication was authorized by full letter ballot procedures.\n\nSEMI D12-95 (Reapproved 0703) SPECIFICATION FOR EDGE CONDITION OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAY (FPD) SUBSTRATES - # R1-1  Current Practice\n\nR1-1.1  The edges of FPD substrates are modified during the substrate manufacturing process so that, in subsequent panel processing, operator safety is improved and particulate generation is minimized. Currently, a “chamfered edge” process is in general use. This modifies the two “corners” of each edge as shown in Figure 1.\n\nSEMI D12-95 (Reapproved 0703) SPECIFICATION FOR EDGE CONDITION OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAY (FPD) SUBSTRATES - # R1-2  Future Developments (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI D12-95 (Reapproved 0703) SPECIFICATION FOR EDGE CONDITION OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAY (FPD) SUBSTRATES - # R1-2  Future Developments\n\nContent: R1-2.1 Other edge treatments may prove more efficient, and several alternate approaches are under development. Two of these are a “Radiused Edge” and “Rounded Edge,” shown in Figures R1-1 and R1-2. The radiused edge initially appears simple, but appropriate values of R, for various substrate thicknesses (T), are being examined for manufacturability. For cases where $\\mathbb { R } > \\mathbb { T }$ , the proper “edge blend,” where R intercepts the substrate pattern and back surfaces, may prove difficult to define and control.

These feature requirements facilitate the interfacing of transport equipment to the tool by standardizing the feature requirements. Such standards are intended to promote cost-effective interfacing while preserving freedom of choice in material handling equipment.\n\nSEMI D16-0998 SPECIFICATION FOR MECHANICAL INTERFACE BETWEEN FLAT PANEL DISPLAY MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM AND TOOL PORT - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  These standards define mechan ical features on or about the process tool port, and in front of or on the tool face. Although these features are intended for specific functions, they do not set design requirements for any particular functionality. The interface requirements are meant to be universal and to avoid the promotion of any particular form of transport. Therefore, they are useful for the interfacing of continuous direct WIP transports, such as conveyors, or discrete vehicles of foreseeable future design, such as AGVs, to the process tool port.

Table 2 provides two options of pitch and capacity. Additional pitch and capacity options are not yet defined, but should be specified in the same manner. 5.4 Material — To be agreed upon between supplier and user.

As shown in Figure 5 and defined in Table 3, each pin is radially symmetric about the vertical center axis line and can be seen as the intersection of a cylinder of diameter $d 1$ and a sphere of radius $r 3$ (which might contact a flat plate). An additional rounding radius $r 5$ provides contact with angled mating surfaces, and blend radii $r 4$ and $^ { r 6 }$ smooth the resulting edges. The final roughness height of the over-all surface finish must be less than or equal to $r 7$ . Dimensions $r 2$ and $z 1 3$ have zero tolerance because they only give a distance to another toleranced dimension.

The location of this surface with respect to the horizontal datum plane is specified by dimension $z 3$ . 6.5 Substrate Orientation and Numbering — The substrates must be horizontal when the carrier is placed on the coupling, and the substrates are numbered in increasing order from bottom to top (so the bottom substrate is substrate number 1, the next substrate up is substrate number 2, etc.) 6.6 Cassette\n\nSEMI D18-0299ESPECIFICATION FOR CASSETTES USED FOR HORIZONTALTRANSPORT AND STORAGE OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAYSUBSTRATES - # 6.2.3  Cassette Physical Alignment In terface-Type $C$ — to be developed.

The top of this volume is half of $z 7$ above the nominal substrate seating plane and its bottom is $z 6$ above the nominal substrate seating plane.

The tooth surface that touches the substrate should have a large radius to minimize stress on the substrate and tooth. A1-1.2 Extra clearance (larger than the pitch) has been added below the bottom substrate (for non-random sequential access to the substrates with a faster or less precise robot). To increase the stability of Type A Cassettes the points on the cassette bottom that are the most distant from the lines connecting each pair of coupling pins should be made as close as practical to the horizontal datum plane so that the cassette cannot tip very far off of the kinematic coupling.

It is expressed as the maximum value of a minimum zone method straightness of a certain sampling within an evaluation length. An approximation in Appendix 1 of SEMI D15 can be used as well. NOTE 2: It is recommended that the computer approximation method described in Appendix 1 of SEMI D15 be used. 5.2 minimum zone method straigh tness — the smallest distance between two parallel straight lines between which all of objective profile is included (see ISO 1101, Section 3.1). 5.3 reference edges — the two edg es adjacent to the orientation corner. 5.4 squareness — the total variatio n of the position of the short sides of a substrate relative to straight lines drawn between the ends of, and perpendicular to, the long reference edge of the substrate. 5.5 warp — the gap between a) th e bottom surface of an FPD substrate and b) the reference plate on which the substrate rests.

This scale is typically important for some film deposition and lithography processes. See Figure 6. 5 Local thickness variation is the absolute value of the maximum deviation of the substrate from a plane constructed in any $1 0 0 { - } 1 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ square area, within the Quality Area, when the substrate back surface is constrained against a vacuum chuck. This scale is typically important for lithographic stepper processes. 6 Waviness is the rms (root mean square) surface profile, within the quality area, over $0 . 8 { - } 8 \\mathrm { m m }$ spatial wavelengths. 7 See Figure 3. 8 See Figure 2. 9 See Figure 4. 10 This table applies to the indicated edge length ranges and thicknesses. 11 Example: For an $8 0 0 \\times 9 5 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ substrate, the\n\nSEMI D24-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR GLASS SUBSTRATES USED TO MANUFACTURE FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS - # 8  Ordering Information (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI D24-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR GLASS SUBSTRATES USED TO MANUFACTURE FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS - # 8  Ordering Information\n\nContent: effective process area, which excludes portions not processable for physical reasons, would be $\\geq$ $7 6 0 \\times \\geq 9 1 0 \\mathrm { { m m } }$ .
