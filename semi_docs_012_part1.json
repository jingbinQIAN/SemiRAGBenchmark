The procedure establishes the voltage response of the LPPD for these particles. The reported size for unknown particles is the same size of the monodisperse particle whose voltage response is the voltage pulse produced by the unknown particle (called Optical Equivalent Size). A2-1.2 If an LPPD is able to detect all of the distribution (see counting efficiency) generated by a monodisperse aerosol and the size of the particle standard is known, the calibrating of an LPPD without a reference particle counter is possible. Ideally, the data collected by the LPPD observing a monodisperse aerosol would describe a Gaussian particle size distribution. However, the reported voltage pulse height distribution is often not symmetric. Therefore, the mode and modal values of the pulse height distribution are not equal. The thresholds for different particle sizes are set as the\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-2  Particle Size Resolution (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-2  Particle Size Resolution\n\nContent: mode or median value of the observed distribution. The modal voltage method is commonly used. A2-1.3 The intensity of the scattered light detected by a photodetector depends on intensity, polarization state, and wavelength of the incident light beam, diameter, shape, and refractive index of the particle, as well as on the geometrical layout of the collection optics and detector. In the particle size range near the wavelength $( 0 . 1 \\lambda < \\mathrm { d } _ { \\mathrm { P } } < 1 0 \\lambda )$ ), large oscillations can be seen in the intensity curve of the light scattered by spherical particles as a function of all these parameters. Therefore, the response curve might not be monotonic. Particles of more than one size will produce the same voltage output signal. The calibration particles should be chosen so that their response is not included in such reversals of the calibration curves. A2-1.4 For calibration checks, a reference particle counter (RPC) with a good sizing\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-2  Particle Size Resolution (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-2  Particle Size Resolution\n\nContent: capability could be used. The counting efficiency of the RPC shall be $100 \\%$ for the particle sizes used in test. The counts of the RPC and the LPPD under test in the corresponding channel should be normalized to a standard detection area $( \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 } )$ . A2-2.1 Particle size resolution of a particle detector describes its capability to differentiate between particles of nearly the same size, or it is a measure of the range of sizes which the counter would assign to a particular particle if its size was determined repeatedly. The resolution is specified by the coefficient of variation (in $\\%$ ) obtained by dividing the portion of the standard deviation of the distribution $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { L P P D } }$ that is contributed by the LPPD by the mean particle size. A2-2.2 The employed particle size should be at least 2 times larger than the lower detection limit of the instrument and is within a monotonic response range of the LPPD response curve. The size\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-2  Particle Size Resolution (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-2  Particle Size Resolution\n\nContent: $\\mathbf { d } _ { \\mathrm { p } }$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { d , p } }$ of the used particles is necessary to calculate the resolution. A2-2.3 To determine the resolution, the standard deviation of the observed particle distribution $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { p , L P P D } }$ is calculated. The quality of the photodetector is checked by determining the standard deviation of the pure sensor signal σV,LPPD at the analog calibration output with a pulse height analyzer. The $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { L P P D } }$ is calculated by the following formula: $$ \\sigma _ { _ { L P P D } } = \\sqrt { \\left( \\sigma _ { { } _ { P , L P P D } } \\right) ^ { 2 } - \\left( \\sigma _ { { } _ { d , p } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } $$\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-3  Zero Counting\n\nA2-3.1  The intent of this procedure is not to adjust the thresholds for the zero count rate but to verify whether the LPPD is within its specification. It is assumed that the zero count level of a correct operating LPPD is sufficiently better than its specification. Failure of the verification test is due to a physical failure within the LPPD and not to statistical variation in the measurement.  \nA2-3.2  The output of a photodetector and the electronic circuits of the particle detector is afflicted with noise. The zero count rate verification is carried out to ensure that data, especially near the detection limit of the LPPD, is generated by particles rather than by noise. To achieve this goal, the basic thresholds for the LDL are to be set so that a signal-to-noise ratio of at least $3 ~ \\mathrm { d B }$ is ensured. The sampling time shall be long enough to provide adequate sampling statistics.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-5  Sensitivity (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-5  Sensitivity\n\nContent: A2-4.1 The counting efficiency for a specific particle size is defined as the ratio of the detected concentration of particles to the concentration actually present. The determination of the counting efficiency of an LPPD requires particles of known size and concentration in the aerosol. The counting efficiency is affected by several factors. First, the counting efficiency is dependent on a specific particle size. The effect of particle concentration is addressed under zero counting and coincidence. Due to inhomogeneous light intensity within the detection area of the particle counter, not all small particles near the lower detection limit of the instrument are detected. If the sampling flow is not completely contained within the defined detection area, then some portions of the aerosol will not be counted. A2-4.2 Ideally, the counting efficiency of a particle counter covering $100 \\%$ of the line cross-section area as detection area would consist of a step function at the point of the\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-5  Sensitivity (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-5  Sensitivity\n\nContent: LDL. Real particle detectors have a gradual transition (efficiency curve) instead of a step function. The point with $50 \\%$ detection probability of all particles of a given size moving through the detection area is often used as a reference point. The corresponding particle size is called the minimum detectable particle size (see sensitivity). If the slope of the efficiency curve for two detectors with the same specified $5 0 \\%$ efficiency point is different, the two detectors may show different particle counts for the same polydisperse aerosol. To define an efficiency curve, more than one particle size, e.g. 5 particle sizes around the LDL covering $0 \\%$ to $100 \\%$ efficiency, should be used. Acceptable counting efficiency for single particle counting instruments is $5 0 \\% \\pm \\ : 2 0 \\%$ at the minimum detection size and $1 0 0 \\% \\pm 1 0 \\%$ for all particles larger than 1.5 times the minimum size. A2-4.3 The detection area of most LPPDs comprises only a small portions of the\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-5  Sensitivity (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-5  Sensitivity\n\nContent: cross-section area of the line. Therefore, it is not possible to specify a $50 \\%$ efficiency point. For this, the commonly used definition for sensitivity could not be used for such instruments. A2-4.4 The actual particle concentration is determined with a reference particle counter with a $100 \\%$ counting efficiency for the employed particle size. It is important that there are no differences between the concentration within the detection area of the LPPD and the concentration monitored by the RPC. A2-5.1 The particle size corresponding to the point with $50 \\%$ counting efficiency of the particles of a given size is defined as the minimum detectable particle size. This is valid only for particle counters capable to reach $100 \\%$ counting efficiency for a specific particle size. This does not apply to most LPPDs.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-6  Particle Concentration Effects\n\nA2-6.1  All optical particle detectors are able to operate accurately only within a limited range of particle concentration. It is not the scope of this document to define how this limit is measured or how to verify the specification.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-6.2  High Concentration Effects (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-6.2  High Concentration Effects\n\nContent: A2-6.2.1 The upper limitation of the particle concentration is chiefly based on coincidence effects. A2-6.2.2 One effect is optical coincidence. If the particle concentration is too high, more than one particle is present within the detection area of the instrument. The reported particle concentration will be less than the true value, and the reported particle size distribution will be shifted towards the indication of larger particles than in reality. A2-6.2.3 The other effect is electronic coincidence. It is defined as the inability of the electronic pulse processing system to detect and size individual pulses that are too closely spaced. If there are so many pulses that they cannot completely return to the baseline, they become superimposed. Electronic saturation occurs. Electronic coincidence introduces errors in both particle size and counts as well. Normally, this problem is not critical for modern electronic systems. Optical coincidence can become a problem at\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-6.2  High Concentration Effects (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-6.2  High Concentration Effects\n\nContent: particle levels well below the point where electronic saturation occurs. A2-6.2.4 Another error can occur when high concentrations of particles just smaller than the lower detection limit of the instrument are present. Even though no single one of these particles will be detected, scattering-light levels from these particles can increase the background optical noise level. So, errors might be produced in particle count data in the lower particle size ranges reported by the counter.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A2-6.3  Low Concentration Effects\n\nA2-6.3.1  It is obvious that it is necessary to collect sufficient data to determine number and size of particles within an acceptable confidence limit.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # APPENDIX 3 AEROSOL GENERATION AND AEROSOL DILUTION\n\n1 NOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E104 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-1  Monodisperse Particle Suspension (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-1  Monodisperse Particle Suspension\n\nContent: A3-1.1 Monodisperse suspensions of particles (PSL) are available in sizes from $0 . 0 2 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . These particles are grown by emulsion polymerization and are stabilized in aqueous suspensions with an anionic surfactant. They carry a negative charge which contributes to their stability. The suspension normally contains $10 \\%$ solids and $2 \\%$ dissolved, highly viscous stabilizer. The solid contains up to $8 \\%$ emulsifier and inorganics. A3-1.2 After evaporation, these solids and the stabilizer will both increase the diameter of the single particle and generate a residual nucleus out of an empty droplet. These residual particles are called secondary aerosol. The diameter of residual nucleus could be up to $0 . 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ according to the PSL size and dilution of the suspension. Most of these secondary aerosol particles might be too small to be detectable with commonly used particle detectors, but they will have an influence on the\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-1  Monodisperse Particle Suspension (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-1  Monodisperse Particle Suspension\n\nContent: noise level because of there high number. A3-1.3 Out of a high-concentration suspension it is not possible to aerosolize only individual particles. Droplets containing more than one of the suspended particles will become undesirable agglomerates upon evaporation. A3-1.4 For this, an adequate dilution of the suspension is necessary to avoid the formation of aggregates and the enlargement of the particles.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-2  Generation and Dilution of PSL Suspension (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-2  Generation and Dilution of PSL Suspension\n\nContent: A3-2.1 A diluted PSL suspension for particle generation in an aerosol generator can be created by the following procedure: Shaking and/or ultrasonic treatment of the PSL bottle distributed by the PSL manufacturer. Placing one drop of PSL in one liter of deionized or destilled water or Isopropanol. The water could be cleaned using a filter with a pore size no more than $10 \\%$ of the size of the particles being used. Shaking and/or ultrasonic treatment of the suspension to disperse the particles. A3-2.2 The suspension will probably need to be diluted further to provide a required particle concentration. This is necessary to avoid the formation of agglomerates and to restrict the size of the secondary aerosol particles. An equation to calculate the required particle concentration is given in “The Generation of Aerosols of Fine Particles” by O. Raabe (see Section 11). A3-2.3 The particle suspensions distributed by the PSL manufacturer shows no detectable\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-2  Generation and Dilution of PSL Suspension (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-2  Generation and Dilution of PSL Suspension\n\nContent: variation in particle characteristics when they are stored in a cool place over the years. Diluted suspensions for atomization feature an aging process. Diluted suspensions of polymer spheres smaller than $1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ should not be stored for more than one week. NOTE A3-1: Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the polymer spheres and the suspension.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-3  Aerosol Generation\n\nA3-3.1  The diluted suspension is nebulized in the aerosol generator. Great account is taken of concentration and size distribution of the generated droplets and of the volume flow rate $ { \\mathrm { ~  ~ V ~ } } _ { \\mathrm { G } } ^ { \\prime } ,$ . To achieve a constant aerosol production, the volume flow rate and the droplet size distribution should be constant and independent of the supplies of suspension in the reservoir. The variation in particle concentration should be no more than $10 \\%$ as measured by the reference particle counter over a time period of 15 minutes or more.  \nNOTE A3-2: Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the aerosol generator.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-4  Aerosol Drying\n\nA3-4.1  The water of the generated droplets will completely evaporate when the relative humidity of the aerosol flow behind the nebulizer is lower than $70 \\%$ . The volume flow of the suspension in the nozzle increases the humidity of the filtered compressed air which has a relative humidity of $1 0 \\% - 1 5 \\%$ in spite of predrying. The use of a diffusion dryer or another appropriate instrument allows a higher relative humidity of the aerosol flow behind the aerosol generator. The diffusion dryer uses silica gel desiccant to remove the moisture. The desiccant shall either be new or freshly regenerated. It is not wise to get the aerosol in direct contact with the desiccant. Polymer spheres will be precipitated and additional particles out of the desiccant will change the particle size distribution of the aerosol.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-5  Aerosol Neutralization\n\nA3-5.1  When dispersing the suspension, the particles are charged. This surface charge should be removed after drying the aerosol flow to avoid electrostatic interactions with each other or the line walls. With the help of the discharging distance of an electrostatic neutralizer, the aerosol is exposed to a bipolar ion source. Some electrostatic neutralizers may produce a large number of ultra-fine particles which will combine with the calibration aerosol and affects the signal-tonoise-ratio of the LPPD and the reference particle counter.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-6  Aerosol Size Separation\n\nA3-6.1  When calibrating with ultra-fine particles, a particle size separation might be necessary to remove the residue particles and agglomerates. An electrostatic classifier is most effective for particle sizes less than 1 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . This instrument electrically charges the incoming aerosol. With electrostatic deflection, it separates selected particles of one mobility. The residue particles and the larger aggregate particles would be stripped out of the particle stream consisting of the desired polymer particles. To charge the aerosol, the electrostatic classifier uses a radioactive neutralizer. The aerosol exiting the instrument will contain singly charged particles. This low charge level makes the use of an additional aerosol neutralizer unnecessary. Nevertheless, conductive tubing should be used between the aerosol generator and the LPPD and reference particle counter to minimize electrostatic particle loss.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A3-7  Aerosol Dilution\n\nA3-7.1  The particle concentration of the aerosol generated by the nebulizer might be too high. The aerosol should be further diluted to achieve the required concentration and to avoid coincidence errors. The dilution could be executed with a mixing chamber in which the aerosol is mixed with zero gas. The internal chamber pressure should be stable and very close to ambient atmospheric pressure at operational flow rates. The spatial particle distribution in the exiting aerosol should be as homogenous as possible.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # APPENDIX 4 AEROSOL TRANSPORT AND AEROSOL SAMPLING\n\nNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI E104 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures on July 28, 2000 by the European Regional Standards Committee.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A4-1  Aerosol Transport (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A4-1  Aerosol Transport\n\nContent: A4-1.1 Aerosol loss in lines occurs both for small and larger particles. Larger particles (approximately $5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and larger) are lost as a result of gravitational settling in horizontal lines and inertial effects in all lines. Smaller particles are lost to the line walls by diffusion and by electrostatic charge effects. A4-1.2 A limitation of particle loss could be achieved with tubing as short and as straight as possible with no bends with a radius of curvature less than $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ . The tubing of the calibration setup should be smooth, conductive, and electrically grounded. Stainless, polished steel for rigid lines and Polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride for flexible lines is found acceptable for handling most aerosols with low electrostatic particle loss. If long transit lines are required, they should be sized to permit a Reynolds number in the range of 5,000 to 25,000 at the sample flow rate to minimize particle residence time in the tubing\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A4-1  Aerosol Transport (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A4-1  Aerosol Transport\n\nContent: without causing excessive turbulence at high flow rates.\n\nSEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A4-2  Aerosol Sample Acquisition (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E104-0303 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATION AND GUIDELINE FOR CALIBRATION OF LOW-PRESSURE PARTICLE MONITOR - # A4-2  Aerosol Sample Acquisition\n\nContent: A4-2.1 The term isokinetic sampling often is used in aerosol measurement and characterization. Isokinetic sampling of particles in a moving aerosol is performed by matching the sample probe inlet velocity (flow speed and direction) to the velocity of the moving aerosol. At velocities less than $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ , anisokinetic sampling errors are negligible for most particles smaller than approximately $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Losses of larger particles might be significant. The larger the particle, the larger the loss due to inertial effects. Isokinetic sampling is not possible in environmental conditions with varying velocity, motionless air, and turbulent, random, or nonunidirectional flow. For better sampling inlet efficiency, isokinetic or at least isoaxial sampling is recommended at calibration.

A carrier handler of the internal buffer type has the functions of handling and storing the carriers. A carrier handler for FOUPs has the opener(s) for opening and closing FOUPs. 5.2.6 cart — a floor-based carrier transfer vehicle (as defined\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 5.2  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 5.2  Definitions\n\nContent: in SEMI E101). 5.2.7 cassette — an open structure that holds one or more substrates. 5.2.8 docking — the act of locating a floor-based carrier transport vehicle for carrier transfer to/from equipment (as defined in SEMI E101). 5.2.9 equipment front end module (EFEM) — consists of the carrier handler that receives carriers from the factory material handling system on one or more load ports (as specified in SEMI E15.1), opens the carriers (if needed), and may include a substrate handler for unloading and loading wafers from the carrier to the process part of the equipment (as defined in SEMI E101). 5.2.10 facial datum plane — a vertical plane that bisects the wafers and that is parallel to the front side of the carrier (where wafers are removed or inserted). On tool load ports, it is also parallel to the load face plane specified in SEMI E15 on the side of the tool where the carrier is loaded and unloaded (as defined in SEMI E57). 5.2.11 fixed buffer – EFEM configuration with carrier places only\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 5.2  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 5.2  Definitions\n\nContent: on load port units arranged in a load port group (as defined in SEMI E101). 5.2.12 front-opening unified pod (FOUP) — a box (that complies with SEMI E47.1) with a non-removable cassette (so that its interior complies with SEMI E1.9) and with a front-opening interface (that mates with a FIMS port that complies with SEMI E62) (as defined in SEMI E47.1). 5.2.13 horizontal datum plane — a horizontal plane from which projects the kinematic-coupling pins on which the carrier sits. On tool load ports, it is at the load height specified in SEMI E15 and might not be physically realized as a surface (as defined in SEMI E57). 5.2.14 internal buffer — EFEM configuration with carrier places different from load port units (as defined in SEMI E101). 5.2.15 minienvironment — a localized environment created by an enclosure to isolate the product from contamination and people. 5.2.16 OHT — overhead transport system with hoist for lifting carriers between load port level and transport level (as defined in SEMI\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 5.2  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 5.2  Definitions\n\nContent: E101). 5.2.17 pod — a box having a Standard Mechanical Interface (SMIF) per SEMI E19. 5.2.18 substrate handler — transfers substrates between carriers and the process part of the equipment (as defined in SEMI E101). 5.2.19 wafer carrier — any cassette, box, pod, or boat that contains wafers (as defined in SEMI E15).\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards\n\nContent: 6.1 Overview — Figure 2 shows roughly what most of the SEMI standards for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ physical interfaces and carriers specify. However, this picture is greatly oversimplified. For example, a front-opening shipping box (FOSB) compliant with SEMI M31 (with its thicker door) generally cannot be opened by equipment load ports that are compliant with SEMI E63. Also, a wire link to an OHT for the carrier handoff parallel I/O can also be located at the top of the equipment. Furthermore, the atmospheric wafer handler for emptying the carrier will generally be different from the wafer handler used in the vacuum environment of the central handler module of a cluster tool. 6.2 Kinematic Coupling — The foundational document of the SEMI standards for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ physical interfaces and carriers is SEMI E57 which specifies the mechanical couplings used to ergonomically align and precisely support $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ wafer carriers. The kinematic\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards\n\nContent: coupling consists of three pins that mate with grooves on the bottom of the wafer carrier (which are not specified) for physical alignment and support. Most of the dimensions in the SEMI standards for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ physical interfaces and carriers are determined with respect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in SEMI E57: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and the bilateral datum plane. Such a kinematic coupling can be used at several interfaces, including: between a FOUP or cassette and an equipment load port or vehicle nest, between a transport cassette and a box, and between a process cassette or quartz boat and the floor of a process chamber. 6.3 Wafer Carriers — SEMI E1.9 and SEMI E47.1 specify the carriers used to transport and store $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ wafers in an IC manufacturing facility. SEMI E47.1 specifies the outside features of the front-opening unified pod (FOUP). The inside features of the FOUP are specified in\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards\n\nContent: SEMI E1.9, which also specifies the open cassette. Both standards specify carriers that hold either 13 or 25 wafers. SEMI M31 specifies the frontopening shipping box (FOSB) used to transport and ship $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ wafers. SEMI E103 specifies a system that includes a box that holds only one wafer and that fits onto an adapter mechanism called a single-wafer interface (SWIF). This system appears to the equipment to be a $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ FOUP (except that only the volume around the middle wafer may be accessible). 6.4 Equipment Load Ports — SEMI E15.1 specifies the carrier load ports at the front of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ process or metrology equipment (or stockers). In addition, the substrate port that opens a FOUP door is specified in SEMI E62 (FIMS). At the floor below each load port is a cart docking interface exclusion volume specified in SEMI E64; this volume can contain a PGV docking flange as specified in SEMI E83. SEMI E63 (BOLTSM) or\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards\n\nContent: SEMI E92 (BOLTS-Light) or both standards specify the mechanical interface between the main part of a process or metrology tool and the box opener/loader unit that opens FOUPs and presents them to the tool wafer handler for unloading and loading 300 mm wafers. Also associated with each load port is a wire or optical link (from the equipment to the AMHS carrier delivery system) specified in SEMI E84 which is the $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ version of SEMI E23. SEMI E99 and SEMI E99.1 specify the electronics and communication interface between a carrier ID reader/writer and the equipment controller. SEMI E101 specifies the functional structure model and component behavior for the entire equipment front-end module (EFEM). SEMI E110 specifies the placement of indicators and switch. 6.5 Cluster-Tools — SEMI standards for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ cluster tools include SEMI E22.1, SEMI E21.1, SEMI E26.1, and SEMI E25. 6.6 AMHS — SEMI standards for automated material handling systems\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards\n\nContent: (AMHS) include SEMI E85. 6.7 Equipment Volume and Weight — SEMI E72 specifies limits on the footprint, height, and weight of equipment for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ fabs. Separate limits are given for the parts of the equipment in the main fab and in the sub-fab. Separate limits are also given for the equipment after it is installed and for the components of the equipment as it is moved into the fab. 6.8 Back-End Standards — SEMI G74 specifies the tape frames used for $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ wafers between the dicing process and the die-bonding process. SEMI G77 specifies the mechanical features of a metal or plastic frame cassette used for framed $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ wafers between the wafer mounting process and the die-bonding process. Future standards may also specify the carrier for thinned $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ wafers and the load port for backend process or metrology equipment. 6.9 Standards of Uncertain Use — Some SEMI 300 mm standards that passed balloting have\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 6  Description of the Standards\n\nContent: a scope of application or extent of use that is yet to be fully determined. Such standards include SEMI M29 which specifies a manually-opening shipping box for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ wafers. In the other SEMI $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ standards are also some options of uncertain use such as bottom-opening pods and pods with removable cassettes.\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 7  Application of Standards to Products (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 7  Application of Standards to Products\n\nContent: 7.1 One-Sided Interface Specifications — The SEMI standards for $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ physical interfaces and carriers are intended to set an appropriate level of specification that places minimal limits on innovation while ensuring modularity and inter-changeability between different types of products. To accomplish this, only one side of each mechanical interface (between different types of products) is specified, leaving the supplier of the product on the other side of the interface more freedom to improve their product. For example, only the bottom half of the kinematic coupling (the pin) is specified by SEMI E57 so that suppliers can be flexible in designing wafer carrier grooves that can mate with it. Table 1 shows which standards apply to each type of product and shows which side of the interface is specified: “D” indicates if the standard directly specifies that type of product (by specifying that product’s side of the relevant interface). “I” indicates if\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 7  Application of Standards to Products (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 7  Application of Standards to Products\n\nContent: the standard indirectly specifies that type of product (by specifying the other side of the relevant interface). 7.2 Carriers — A FOUP is directly specified by SEMI E47.1 (for its outside features not including the door) and by SEMI E1.9 (for its inside features). The FOUP is indirectly specified by SEMI E57 (for its kinematic coupling grooves) and by SEMI E62 (for its FIMS door interface). Thus, if a FOUP door fails to open or close correctly on any load port that complies with SEMI E57 and SEMI E62, that FOUP is in violation of the standards. The wafer support function of all of the 300 mm carriers is specified directly (by specifying where the wafers must be located rather than specifying the shape and location of the supports), so the $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ wafer standards indirectly specify the carriers. 7.3 Stockers — A carrier stocker is directly specified by SEMI E57 (for the kinematic coupling pins on its shelves, if any, and on its manual/AGV/RGV and interbay\n\nSEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 7  Application of Standards to Products (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E106-1104 OVERVIEW GUIDE TO SEMI STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL INTERFACES AND CARRIERS FOR 300 mm WAFERS - # 7  Application of Standards to Products\n\nContent: load ports), by SEMI E15.1 (for its manual/AGV/RGV load ports), by SEMI E85 (for its interbay load ports), by SEMI E84 (for its carrier handoff parallel I/O at either kind of load port) and by SEMI E64 (for the cart docking interface exclusion volume below each manual/AGV/RGV load port).

Current edition approved by the European Regional Standards Committee on December 20, 2000.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2001; to be published March 2001.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The purpose of this standard is to define a test method for the determination of the outgassing organic contamination from minienvironments used for storage and transport of wafers using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS).  \n1.2  This test method is intended as an alternative to SEMI E46. The main difference between SEMI E46 and this document is that SEMI E46 defines a test method which is based on ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS) as the measurement technique while this standard is based on gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy in combination with thermal desorption. Additionally, this test method provides a procedure for testing the outgassing of organic compounds in a complete minienvironment. The results of SEMI E46 and this document are given in different units.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  The test method provided in th is document is applicable to the assessment of the outgassing of organic contamination from minienvironments.  \n2.2  Gas chromatography/mass spe ctroscopy is chosen as the method to determine organic contamination because it is commonly used for characterization and quantification of organic compounds. In combination with thermal desorption, it provides a method for the identification of organic compounds in the atmosphere (i.e., inside the minienvironment) as well as directly from source materials, and transferred contaminants. This method can also be used to evaluate materials and processes used in semiconductor industry.  \n2.3  This test method is based on A STM F1982.  \n2.4  This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  The test methodologies, metric s and applications provided in this standard are limited by the following constraints:  \n3.1.1  The specific recovery of comp ounds by the proposed standard method strongly depends on the setup of the apparatus used. This has been taken into account by the use of the “reference-cocktail”, see Section 9.2.  \n3.2  Identification of the source of organic compounds inside the minienvironment is out of the scope of this test method. For a procedure for the analysis of outgassing organic compounds from individual materials using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, see IDEMA M11-99.  \n3.3  This test method does not prov ide a procedure how to use the obtained data for assessing the risks that come from individual compounds.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E46 — Test Method for the Determination of Organic Contamination from Minienvironments  \nSEMI F21 — Classification of Airborne Molecular Contaminant Levels in Clean Environments  \n4.2  ASTM Standard  \nASTM F1982 — Standard Test Methods for Analyzing Organic Contaminants on Silicon Wafer Surfaces by Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatography.  \n4.3  IDEMA Standard2  \nIDEMA M11-99 — General Outgas Test Procedure by Dynamic Headspace Analysis  \nNOTE 1: As listed or revised, all documents cited shall be the latest publications of adopted standards.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  analytical environment — env ironment where all analytical measurements are taking place.  \n5.2  headspace sampling — in this standard defined as: collecting volatile organic compounds in an enclosed volume by means of a silicon wafer or silicon wafer chips.  \n5.3  minienvironment — A localized environment for transport and storage created by an enclosure to isolate the product from contamination and people.\n5.4  sample — wafer or wafer chip s used for the headspace sampling of organic contaminants.\n5.5  static storage conditions — co nditions excluding any active movement of test specimens.\n5.6  thermal desorption tube — An alytical equipment capable of collecting organic compounds of interest (i.e., adsorbent filled glass tube).\n5.7  wafer — Object made of semi conducting material to be processed, handled or stored in the minienvironment to be tested (i.e., prime or processed silicon wafer).\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: 6.1 This test method comprises sto rage tests of wafers in minienvironments under static storage conditions. The contamination is directly measured from the silicon wafer surface. Three important aspects are covered: a) Contamination due to the minienvironment alone, b) Contamination from the use of minienvironments for wafer processing, and c) Contamination from future materials to be used in semiconductor technology. 6.2 The setup for each test compri ses an analytical equipment in the analytical environment as well as a test equipment in the test environment. Each environment has to fulfill the following requirements: 6.2.1 Analytical Environment — shall be clean enough with respect to airborne organic contamination: recommendation is less than 100 pptM for organic compounds with boiling points $> 1 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (Class MC100, according to SEMI F21). 6.2.2 Test Environment — shall equ al the environment in which the test\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: specimen will be used. 6.3 Silicon wafers are placed in th e minienvironment or used for headspace sampling experiments. These wafer samples are then analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to determine the amount of contaminants. 6.4 The wafers or wafer chips to b e used for the test method are decontaminated as described in ASTM F1982 for bare silicon wafers. The surface condition of the wafer (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) has to be adjusted in a reproducible way and has to be the same for all comparative measurements. 6.5 The wafer or the wafer chips a re placed in the minienvironment and are left there under static conditions for the chosen static storage time (depending on the intended use of the minienvironment to be tested, a time between $^ \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ and $2 8 \\mathrm { ~ d ~ }$ may be used). When loaded into the minienvironment the wafer may have a temperature which reflects production circumstances (i.e., $8 0 ^ {\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ when unloading from furnace processes). In some situations wafers may be exposed to severe thermal conditions. The minienvironment should be evaluated under the conditions exposed to. Be sure that the material to be tested does not undergo phase transitions under the chosen temperature conditions. 6.6 After the static storage test per iod, the wafer is returned to the analytical equipment and the organic contamination on the wafer is measured immediately. 6.7 The quantitative value for the total amount of outgassed and adsorbed organics from the minienvironment is calculated as the difference between the detected amount of contamination on a blank sample vs. the amount on the exposed sample.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 7  Interferences\n\n7.1  The presence of organic conta mination in the atmosphere of the test environment may lead to a significant contribution to the detected total amount of organic compounds on the test wafers or wafer chips. Care has to be taken when subtracting the blank value from the test value. Transport times from test environment to analytical environment have to be as short as possible.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 8  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 8  Apparatus\n\nContent: 8.1 For the analysis of organic com pounds on wafers a gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy apparatus with thermal desorption unit is required: A gas chromatography (GC) instrument, which utilizes a capillary column to separate a wide variety of organic compounds, combined with mass spectrometer (MS). A thermal desorption unit is used to desorb organics from sample thermal desorption tubes and collect them in a trap. Two types of trapping may be used: a) cooling the trap down to a minimum of $- 1 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ does not require any adsorbent (glass wool may be used) or b) a Tenax $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ filled trap has to be cooled down to a minimum of $- 2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . 8.1.1 The thermal desorption unit is coupled to the gas chromatography instrument via a heated transfer line.

In this case sample thermal desorption tubes packed with adsorbent have to be used to trap compounds desorbed from the wafer. These thermal desorption tubes are analyzed within the thermal desorption unit (method B). 8.2 The analysis of outgassing org anic contamination from minienvironments requires an extremely sensitive analytical equipment. Recovery and limit of detection for the different classes of compounds must be evaluated carefully in order to ensure reliable results.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 9  Reagents and Materials\n\n9.1  For the materials used for hand ling and transport of wafers clean, decontaminated equipment has to be used, e.g. tweezers heated in a propane flame. Refer to the reagent and materials described in SEMI E46 and ASTM F1982.  \n9.2  Test Mixture — For the calibra tion of equipment and the quantification of the amount of contamination a test mixture (”cocktail”) is used. This mixture was chosen in order to give an ”average” over typical substance classes present in semiconductor production lines, which have high sticking factors to the wafer surface. The response factor of the MS-detection for organics varies significantly. As this is true for all contaminants, the method gives a realistic trustworthy quantitative correlation to a ”typical average compound mixture” of contaminants on wafer surfaces.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 9.3  Preparation of Test Mixture\n\n9.3.1  The mixture consists of triethy l phosphate, ε-caprolactam, palmitic acid and diethylhexyl phthalate each $0 . 5 \\mathrm { \\textrm { ~ } } \\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mu \\mathrm { l }$ in isooctane (as solvent).

A cleaning step can be added but there must be no contribution from the cleaning procedure to the outgassing of organic compounds from the minienvironment. The cleaning method has to be defined by the supplier or agreed upon between supplier and user of the tested minienvironment.  \n11.2  Sample — The wafers shall be made organic-free before using them to monitor organic contamination. The surface condition of the wafer (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) has to be adjusted in a reproducible way and has to be the same for comparative measurements. Refer to SEMI E46 and ASTM F1982.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12  Procedure\n\n12.1  The procedure described below is used for obtaining the baseline value of the method (method blank) as well as the test value for outgassing organic compounds of the minienvironment within a defined static storage time (storage time $\\mathrm { t _ { S } } = 1 \\ \\mathrm { h } - 2 8 \\ \\mathrm { d } ,$ ).  \n12.1.1  Choose that static storage time according to the intended use of the minienvironment (i.e., if the maximum sit time of wafers in a process where the minienvironment is to be used is $^ \\textrm { \\scriptsize 4 h }$ then choose a static storage time of $4 \\ \\mathrm { h }$ ). If no static storage time related to processes can be defined, a recommended value for the first static storage time is 1 day.  \nNOTE 3: Composition of adsorbed compounds may vary with static storage time.  \n12.2  For transport store the wafers o r wafer chips used for testing in decontaminated, organic-free petri-dishes wrapped in organic-free aluminum foil. Refer to SEMI E46.\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.3  Loading Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.3  Loading Procedure\n\nContent: 12.3.1 For tests at room temperature: open a minienvironment to be tested and load it with a decontaminated wafer using decontaminated handling tools (i.e., tweezers). Default storage location is the center slot of the minienvironment. Close the minienvironment. Leave the minienvironment closed for the chosen static storage time. 12.3.2 For tests at elevated temperatu res using a wafer furnace: place the decontaminated wafers in a clean furnace used for production processes and heat the wafers under inert gas to a temperature $> 1 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Turn off the heating. When the temperature of the furnace has reached $( 9 0 \\pm 1 0 ) ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ open the minienvironment to be tested and fully load it with the hot wafers from the furnace. Close the minienvironment. Leave it closed for the chosen static storage time. For analysis use only one wafer. Default wafer is the one in the center slot. 12.3.3 For tests at\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.3  Loading Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.3  Loading Procedure\n\nContent: elevated temperatu res using a heating chamber: open the minienvironment to be tested and load it with a decontaminated wafer using decontaminated handling tools (i.e., tweezers). Default location is the center slot. Close the minienvironment. Wrap the minienvironment with decontaminated aluminum foil. Place the minienvironment in an inert and clean heating chamber heated to $7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Leave it for 1 h and then remove it from the heating chamber and place it at the test minienvironment. Leave it there closed for the chosen static storage time. NOTE 4: The purpose of the aluminum foil is to prevent direct contact between the recirculating hot air inside the heating chamber and the minienvironment. 12.4 Unloading Procedure — Open the minienvironment and unload the wafer using decontaminated handling tools into decontaminated petri-dishes and wrap them into organic-free aluminum foil. Transport the wafer immediately to the\n\nSEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.3  Loading Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E108-0301 TEST METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF OUTGASSING ORGANIC CONTAMINATION FROM MINIENVIRONMENTS USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROSCOPY - # 12.3  Loading Procedure\n\nContent: measurement equipment and analyze the organic contamination on the wafer according to the standard ASTM F1982. 12.5 Method Blank — Perform the test sequence using a container made completely of glass or quartz instead of the minienvironment. Use the same static storage time for the method blank but perform this blank test at room temperature. The container has to be decontaminated with respect to organics inside by heat treatment (refer to SEMI E46). With this blank method the baseline contribution from the cleanroom air on the adsorption of organic contamination on the silicon wafer surface is determined. 12.6 Analyzing Procedure — Put th e wafer or wafer chips in the precleaned desorption unit or thermal desorption tube and heat it for $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ to a minimum of $2 7 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (but $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ is better).

Desorption parameters for adsorbent filled desorption tube and cold trap may be taken from ASTM F1982 (see also Section 12.6.1). 12.6.1 The substances desorbed shou ld be separated by an appropriate column temperature program. A recommended temperature program for standard analysis uses a polydimethylsiloxane/polydiphenylsiloxane (95/5) coated column $( 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\times 0 . 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m } \\times 0 . 2 5$ $\\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , heated from $5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ to $2 5 0 ^ { \\mathrm { { o } } } \\mathrm { { C } }$ at a rate of $1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { { o } } } \\mathrm { { C } / \\mathrm { { m i n } } }$ followed by a temperature hold at $2 5 0 ^ { \\mathrm { { o } } } \\mathrm { { C } }$ for $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ .

The electrical length shall be given in terms of degrees of phase shift.

The transformation is achieved by the use of various reactive components, such as capacitors and inductors, that “tune” the matching network by transforming the impedance at the output of the network to the input of the matching network. For a given frequency, there is a fixed relationship between the impedance at the input of the matching network and the impedance at the output of the matching network (the load impedance). In other words, the impedance to which the matching network is matched (the load impedance) can be determined if the transform properties of the network are known for a given frequency. Typically, there are two methods of impedance transformation. The first method uses a fixed frequency (e.g., $1 3 . 5 6 ~ \\mathrm { M H z }$ ) and variable tuning elements, while the second method uses a variable frequency and fixed tuning elements.

These variable tuning elements typically have an output voltage or encoder value that corresponds to a certain value of the element (i.e., an output voltage will correspond to a specific value of capacitance or inductance in the matching network). The value of the output voltage or encoder value is referred to as the tuning element position. To obtain information on the operation and performance of the matching network, the tuning element positions must be provided as outputs. 7.4.3 For those systems that use variable frequency operation, matching networks typically have fixed tuning\n\nSEMI E113-1104SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENTRF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 7.4  Matching Networks (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E113-1104SPECIFICATION FOR SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENTRF POWER DELIVERY SYSTEMS - # 7.4  Matching Networks\n\nContent: elements (no variation) or tap points between fixed tuning elements, and the frequency is varied to obtain the best matched condition.

For those systems that have variable tap points, the tap point position shall also be provided as an output. 7.4.4 For matching networks run at a fixed frequency with variable tuning elements, the load impedance shall be provided as a function of the tuning element positions. In addition, the efficiency of the matching network shall be provided as a function of the tuning element positions. The information shall be provided in tabular form.
