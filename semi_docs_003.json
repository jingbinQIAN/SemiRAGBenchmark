    "content": "This specification describes an approach to interfacing a clean transport container (pod) to a clean environmental housing on a piece of semiconductor processing equipment or to other clean environments. The system concept involves mating a pod door to a port door in an equipment interface and transferring the wafers into, and out of, the equipment without exposing the wafers to outside contamination.  \nThe incorporation of this standard may require equipment designers to include the features of the interface into the tool design. Spacing between equipment interface ports must be considered when incorporating this interface. Designers are directed to the recommendations made in SEMI E15.1 in this regard.  \nThis standard is specific to the size of the designated wafer and references the appropriate Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) cassette and wafer diameter. This specification focuses on applications in which the interface port is positioned horizontally."

    "content": "1.1  The purpose of the standard is to simplify cluster tool implementation in the fab. Equipment suppliers are required to provide modules that can be connected into any cluster tool using the specifications contained herein.  \n1.1.1  Process and cassette modules accept wafers at locations that may vary substantially from one module to another. This places a burden on the capabilities of transport modules to move wafers to and from various modules in a cluster tool. This specification defines wafer transport planes within cassette and process modules. This obviates the wafer transport problem to a large extent, but does not unduly restrict module content."

    "title": "SEMI E21-94 (Reapproved 1102) CLUSTER TOOL MODULE INTERFACE: MECHANICAL INTERFACE AND WAFER TRANSPORT STANDARD - # 2  Scope",
    "content": "2.1  The standard defines the interface plane between modules in a cluster tool. It provides the mechanical specifications at the interface that allow modules from different suppliers to be connected together; no requirements are imposed on the module content.  \n2.1.1  The standard is limited to wafers which are 200 mm $\\sim 8$ in.) in diameter or smaller and to the interface between cluster tool modules, with the following exception. The transport module operates across the interface plane; thus, a definition of the wafer transport plane within cassette and process modules is required.  \n2.2  This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use."

    "content": "3.1  The adoption of the standard requires cluster tool equipment designers to limit the wafer transport height to a nominal value at the interface plane between two modules. It also requires equipment designers to assure that wafer transport planes within cassette and process modules be clear for wafer transport. The transport module requires the capability for a minimum reach outside the module across the interface plane. Modules may be connected using a quick connect/disconnect clamping system. Constraints are placed on sealing surfaces."

However, for many processes, it is desirable to limit the slot size as far as possible. An option is now allowed to reduce the vertical slot opening on the Attached Modules side of the Interface Plane (see Figure 1, E21), but any such reduction will compromise the space otherwise available for transport arm vertical thickness and/or movement. Specification of the extent of this option will be needed in each case it is used."

The actual cassette transfer action is executed using the parallel I/O interface, interlocking each mechanism.

An error recovery procedure with appropriate assist by human operators will be also required. This standard, however, does not define the specifications related to the error detection and recovery because of difference in process time, failure mode, and error recovery procedure of individual equipment and system. 5.4.1 The recommendation for basic error detection is that the active equipment should control handshake time intervals, and at least the interval time T between the beginning of the cassette transfer and the end of the transfer should be controlled — see the time chart of the cassette transfer sequence shown in Figures 3(a), 3(b), 4(a), and 4(b), describing the time chart of the cassette transfer sequence."

In the case described here, the Transport Module (TM) end effector is extended into a Process Module (PM), which is equipped with an isolation valve. This valve is inhibited from closing by the interlock in the TM. R1-3.2 A situation arises in the PM which results in its interlock inhibiting the opening of the isolation valve (which is already open) on the TM. As specified in Section 4.3.3, the TM detects the interlock change and immediately withdraws its end effector from the PM. The TM interlock enables the closure of the PM isolation valve (which the PM may do if that is the appropriate response to the situation) and the TM can close its isolation valve.

The six surfaces are the inboard and outboard planes, the two sides, the bottom and the top. 3.2 The inboard plane is the interface plane between a transport module and any other module as defined in SEMI E21; thus, a transport module possesses multiple inboard planes. The outboard surface is parallel to the interface plane and normally coincides with that part of the module which is farthest from the interface plane. Each side of the module envelope consists of several vertical planes. The bottom surface generally coincides with the floor, and the top is a horizontal plane that contains the highest point of the module. 3.3 In the sections that follow, the distinction between the physical module and the space reserved for the module within the envelope must be kept in mind.
