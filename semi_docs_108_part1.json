The angular distribution of light scattered by semiconductor surfaces is a generalized basis for most scanning surface inspection systems and as such may be used to cross-correlate various tools. 1.2 The angular distribution of scatter from optically smooth surfaces, such as polished silicon wafers, can be used to calculate surface parameters or reveal surface characteristics. For example, the total scatter found by integrating the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) over the hemisphere can be related to surface roughness. The amount of scatter at a given scatter angle can be associated with a specific surface spatial frequency. 1.3 The angular distribution of scatter is a general property of surfaces that may have direct consequences. Scatter from mirrors and other components in an optical system can be the limiting factor in\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: resolution or optical signal to noise level. Scatter can be an important design parameter for telescopes. Scatter measurements are crucial to correct operation of ring laser gyros. Scatter from a painted surface, such as on automobiles, can influence sales appeal.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This guide explains a procedure for the determination of the amount and angular distribution of optical scatter from an opaque surface. In particular it focuses on measurement of the BRDF, which is a convenient and well accepted means of expressing optical scatter levels for many purposes.1,2 Additional data presentation formats described in Related Information 1 have advantages for certain applications. Surface parameters can be calculated from optical scatter data when assumptions are made about model relationships. Some of these extrapolated parameters are described in Related Information 2. 2.2 Optical scatter from an opaque surface results from surface topography, surface contamination, and subsurface effects. It is the user’s responsibility to be certain that measured scatter levels are ascribed to the correct mechanism. Scatter from small amounts of contamination can easily dominate the scatter from a smooth surface. Likewise, subsurface effects may play a more important scatter role than\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: typically realized when surfaces are superpolished. 2.3 This guide does not provide a method to extrapolate data for one wavelength from data for any other wavelength. Data taken at particular incident and scatter directions are not extrapolated to other directions. In other words, no wavelength or angle scaling is to be inferred from this guide. Normally the user must make measurements at the wavelengths and angles of interest. 2.4 This guide applies only to BRDF measurements on opaque samples. It does not apply to scatter from translucent or transparent materials. There are subtle complications which affect measurement of translucent or transparent materials that are best addressed in separate standards (see, for example, ASTM Practice E 167 and ASTM Guide E 179). 2.5 The wavelengths for which this guide applies include the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared regions. Difficulty in obtaining appropriate sources, detectors, and low scatter optics complicate its practical application at wavelengths less\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: than about $0 . 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . Diffraction effects that start to become important for wavelengths greater than $1 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ complicate its practical application at longer wavelengths. Diffraction effects can be properly dealt with in scatter measurements, but they are not discussed in this practice. 2.6 Any experimental parameter is a possible variable. Parameters that remain constant during a measurement sequence are reported as header information for the tabular data set. Related Information 3 gives a suggested reporting format that is adaptable to varying any of the sample or system parameters. 2.7 This guide applies to flat or curved samples of arbitrary shape. However, only a flat, circular sample is addressed in the discussion and examples. It is the user’s responsibility to define an appropriate sample coordinate system to specify the measurement location on the sample surface for samples that are not flat. 2.8 The apparatus and measurement procedure are generic,\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: so that specific instruments are neither excluded nor implied in the use of this guide.

Additional graphic information will be found in Figures A1-1 through A1-3 in Appendix 1. 4.2 Definitions 4.2.1 angle of incidence, $\\theta _ { I } ,$ — polar angle between the central ray of the incident flux and the ZB axis, normal to the sample surface. 4.2.2 beam coordinate system, XB YB ZB — a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin on the central ray of the incident flux at the sample surface, the $X B$ axis in the plane of incidence (PLIN) and the $Z B$ axis normal to the surface. 4.2.2.1 Discussion — The angle of incidence, scatter angle, and incident and scatter azimuth angles are defined with respect to the beam coordinate system. This coordinate system is illustrated in Figure A1-1. 4.2.3 bidirectional reflectance distribution function, BRDF — the sample radiance divided by the sample irradiance. 4.2.3.1 Discussion — The procedures given in this practice are correct only if the\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: field of view (FOV) determined by the receiver field stop is sufficiently large to include the entire illuminated area for all angles of incidence of interest. BRDF is a differential function dependent on the wavelength, incident direction, scatter direction, and polarization states of the incident and scattered fluxes. In practice, it is calculated from the average radiance divided by the average irradiance as follows: $$ \\mathrm { B R D F } = \\frac { L _ { e } } { E _ { e } } = \\frac { \\frac { P _ { s } } { \\Omega A \\cos \\theta _ { s } } } { \\frac { P _ { i } } { A } } = \\frac { P _ { s } } { P _ { i } \\Omega \\cos \\theta _ { s } } \\Big [ \\mathrm { s r } ^ { - 1 } \\Big ] $$ The BRDF of a lambertian surface is independent of scatter direction. If a surface scatters nonuniformly from one position to another then a series of measurements over the sample surface must be averaged to obtain suitable statistical uncertainty. Nonuniformity may be caused by irregularity of the surface microughness or\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: film, optical property nonhomogeneity, or subsurface defects. 4.2.4 cosine-corrected BRDF — the BRDF times the cosine of the scatter polar angle. 4.2.4.1 Discussion — The $\\cos \\theta _ { s }$ in the BRDF definition is a result of the radiometric definition of BRDF. It is sometimes useful to express the scattered field as normalized scatter intensity [(watts scattered/solid angle)/incident power] as a function of scatter direction. This is accomplished by multiplying the BRDF by $\\cos \\theta _ { s }$ . 4.2.5 delta beta, $\\Delta \\beta$ — the projection of $\\Delta \\beta$ onto the $X B – Y B$ plane, that is, the delta theta angle measured in direction cosine space. 4.2.5.1 Discussion — For scatter in the PLIN, $\\Delta \\beta = \\sin \\theta _ { s } - \\sin \\theta _ { i }$ . For scatter out of the plane of incidence (PLIN) the calculation of $\\Delta \\beta$ becomes more complicated (see $\\ S \\ R 1 - 2 \\$ ). 4.2.6 delta theta, $\\Delta \\theta$ — the angle between the specular direction and the scatter\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: direction. 4.2.7 incident azimuth angle, $\\phi _ { i }$ — the fixed $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ angle from the $X B$ axis to the projection of the incident direction onto the XB-YB plane. 4.2.7.1 Discussion — It is convenient to use a beam coordinate system (refer to Figure A1-2), in which $\\phi _ { i } = 1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , since this makes $\\phi _ { s }$ the correct angle to use directly in the familiar form of the grating equation. Conversion to a sample coordinate system is straight forward, provided the sample location and rotation are known. 4.2.8 incident direction — the central ray of the incident flux specified by $\\theta _ { i }$ and $\\phi _ { i }$ in the beam coordinate system. 4.2.9 incident power, $P _ { i }$ — the radiant flux incident on the sample. 4.2.9.1 Discussion — For relative BRDF measurements, the incident power is not measured directly. For absolute BRDF measurements it is important to verify the linearity, and if necessary correct for the nonlinearity, of the detector system\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: over the range from the incident power level down to the scatter level which may be as many as 13 to 15 orders of magnitude lower. If the same detector is used to measure the incident power and the scattered flux, then it is not necessary to correct for the detector responsivity; otherwise, the signal from each detector must be normalized by its responsivity. 4.2.10 instrument signature — the mean scatter level detected when there is no sample scatter present expressed as BRDF. 4.2.10.1 Discussion — Since BRDF is defined only for a surface, the instrument signature provides an equivalent BRDF for the no-sample situation. The limitation on instrument signature is normally stray scatter from instrument components and out-of-plane aperture position errors for receiver positions near the specular direction. For high grade electronic detection systems, at large scatter angles, the limitation on instrument signature is normally Rayleigh scatter from molecules within the volume of the incident light\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: beam that is sampled by the receiver field of view. As $\\theta _ { s }$ approaches $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , the accuracy of $\\theta _ { s }$ becomes important because of the $1 / \\cos \\theta _ { s }$ term in BRDF. The signature can be measured by scanning a very low scatter reference sample in which case the signature is adjusted by dividing by the reference sample reflectance. The signature is commonly measured by moving the receiver near the optical axis of the source and making an angle scan with no sample in the sample holder. It is necessary to furnish the instrument signature when reporting BRDF data so that the user can decide at what scatter direction the sample BRDF is lost in the signature. Preferably the signature is several decades below the sample data and can be ignored. 4.2.11 noise equivalent BRDF, NEBRDF — the root mean square (rms) of the noise fluctuation expressed as equivalent BRDF. 4.2.11.1 Discussion — Measurement precision is limited by the acceptable signal to noise ratio with\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: respect to these fluctuations. It should be noted that although the detector noise is independent of $\\theta _ { s }$ , the NEBRDF increases at large values of $\\theta _ { s }$ because of the $1 / \\cos \\theta _ { s }$ factor. Measurement precision can also be limited by other experimental parameters as discussed in Section 10. The NEBRDF can be measured by blocking the source light. 4.2.12 plane of incidence, PLIN, — the plane containing the sample normal and central ray of the incident flux. 4.2.13 receiver — a system that generally contains apertures, filters and focusing optics that gathers the scatte signal over a known solid angle and transmits it to the scatter detector element. 4.2.14 receiver solid angle, $\\varOmega$ — the solid angle subtended by the receiver aperture stop from the sample origin. 4.2.15 sample coordinate system — a coordinate system fixed to the sample and used to specify position on th sample surface for the measurement. 4.2.15.1 Discussion — The sample coordinate\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: system is application and sample specific. The Cartesian coordinate system shown in Figure A1-1 is recommended for flat samples. The origin is at the geometric center of the sample face with the $Z$ axis normal to the sample. A fiducial mark must be shown at the periphery of the sample; it is most conveniently placed along either the $X$ or $Y$ axes. For silicon wafers, the fiducial mark is commonly placed on the periphery of the wafer at the $- Y .$ -axis as defined in SEMI M20. 4.2.16 sample irradiance, $E _ { e }$ — the radiant flux incident on the sample surface per unit area. 4.2.16.1 Discussion — In practice, $E _ { e }$ is an average calculated from the incident power, $P _ { i }$ , divided by the illuminated area, $A$ . The incident flux should arrive from a single direction; however, the acceptable degree of collimation or amount of divergence is application specific and should be reported. 4.2.17 sample radiance, $L _ { e } - \\mathrm { a }$ differential quantity that is the reflected\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: radiant flux per unit projected receiver solid angle per unit sample area. 4.2.17.1 Discussion — In practice, $L _ { e }$ is an average calculated from the scattered power, $P _ { s }$ , collected by the projected receiver solid angle, $\\itOmega . \\cos \\theta _ { s }$ , from the illuminated area, $A$ . The receiver aperture and distance from the sample determines $\\varOmega$ and the angular resolution of the instrument. 4.2.18 scatter — the radiant flux that has been redirected over a range of angles by interaction with the sample. 4.2.19 scatter azimuth angle, $\\phi _ { s }$ , — angle from the $X B$ axis to the projection of the scatter direction onto the XB-YB plane. 4.2.20 scatter direction — the central ray of the collection solid angle of the scattered flux specified by $\\theta _ { s }$ and $\\phi _ { s }$ in the beam coordinate system. 4.2.21 scatter plane — the plane containing the central rays of the incident flux and the scatter direction. 4.2.22 scatter polar angle, $\\theta _ { s } .$ ,\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 4  Terminology\n\nContent: — polar angle between the central ray of the scattered flux and the $Z B$ axis. 4.2.23 specular direction — the central ray of the reflected flux that lies in the PLIN with $\\theta _ { s } = \\theta _ { i }$ and $\\phi _ { s } = 0$\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: 5.1 General — Non-specular reflectometers or instruments6 used to measure scattered light utilize some form of the five components described in this section. These components are described in a general manner so as to not exclude any particular type of scatter instrument. To achieve $( \\theta _ { i } , \\ \\phi _ { i } ; \\ \\theta _ { s } , \\ \\phi _ { s } )$ positioning the instrument design must incorporate four angular degrees of freedom between the source, sample holder, and receiver assemblies. 5.2 Source Assembly — containing the source and associated optics to produce irradiance, $E _ { e }$ , on the sample over a specified spot area, $A$ . If a broad band source is used, the wavelength selection technique should be specified. Depending on the bandwidth and selection techniques, the detector assembly may affect the wavelength sensitivity. If a laser source is used, it is usually sufficient to specify the center wavelength; however, it is sometimes necessary to be more specific, such as providing\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: the particular line in a $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ laser. 5.2.1 A source monitor is used to correct for fluctuations in the source intensity. If it is located at the source output it only measures variations in the source power and is not sensitive to variations due to angular drift or downstream transmission. The source monitor should monitor incident power as close to the sample as possible while minimizing additional system scatter. Attention should be paid to possible laser mode hopping and consequent wander of the beam on spatial filter pinholes and to fluctuations in source polarization. 5.2.2 Collimated or slightly converging source light can be used to measure BRDF. Most instruments use a converging beam focused at the receiver. If the convergence angle is small, the uncertainty introduced by a nonunique angle of incidence is usually negligible. The same considerations apply if a curved sample is measured. It is the user's responsibility to assure that any spread in $\\theta _ { i }$ does\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: not compromise the results. Normal practice limits convergence to $f / 2 0$ or greater with a focus at the receiver to increase the angular resolution of measurements near the specular beam or diffraction peaks. 5.2.3 Typically the source assembly is fixed in position and variations in $\\theta _ { i }$ are made with the sample holder. Good reduction of the instrument signature requires baffling around the source assembly and use of a spatial filter to limit off-axis light. The final mirror (or lens) which directs light to the sample should have low scatter, since it contributes directly to small angle scatter in the instrument signature. 5.2.4 A means should be provided for controlling the polarization state of the incident flux as this can impact the measured BRDF. Orthogonal source polarization components (parallel, or $p$ , and perpendicular, or $s$ ) are defined relative to the plane defined by the source direction and the sample surface normal. 5.2.5 Absorbing samples may be heated by the\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: incident flux and may change their scatter characteristics, mechanically distort or burn. Special care must be taken with IR laser sources on absorbing samples. 5.3 Sample Holder — The sample holder should provide a secure mount for the sample that does not introduce any warp. The rotation axes of the stages that achieve the $( \\theta _ { i } , \\phi _ { i } , \\theta _ { s } \\phi _ { s } )$ positioning must be relative to the sample front surface; this can be accomplished by orienting the sample holder or the source, or both, and receiver assemblies. Some sample mounts incorporate positioning stages for a raster scan of the sample surface at fixed incident and scatter angles. The sample mount must be kept unobtrusive so that it does not contribute stray flux to the signature or block large $\\theta _ { s }$ scatter. 5.4 Beam Dump — It is important to trap any specular reflection from the sample so that it cannot contribute to the scatter signal through lab/instrument reflections. Examples of beam\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: dumps are black paper, a razor blade stack, absorbing glass plates, or a tapered blackened glass tube. 5.5 Receiver Assembly — If the system design includes angular degrees of freedom at the receiver for achieving the scatter direction, then the receiver assembly should normally have provisions for rotating about an axis on the front face of the sample in order to vary $\\theta _ { s }$ . If out of the PLIN measurements are required, the receiver assembly may also rotate out of the PLIN. This capability may also be provided by pitch, yaw, and roll of the sample, but it becomes more difficult to dump the specularly reflected beam. 5.5.1 The acceptance aperture for the receiver must be well defined, since the solid angle, $\\varOmega ,$ subtended by the receiver aperture stop from the sample, is used in the BRDF calculation and defines the angular resolution. The field of view of the detector must include the entire irradiated area, A. There can be an exception to these requirements if a relative BRDF\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: or relative total reflectance normalization is used. In that case it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the system parameters remain constant between measurements. 5.5.2 If the acceptance aperture is too small and a coherent source is used to irradiate the sample, speckle may cause strong, unpredictable variations in the scatter. This is a common problem when measuring diffuse (that is, rough) samples. It is sometimes desirable to spin a diffuse sample about its normal to average the effects of speckle while making a measurement. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that BRDF features are not due to speckle. The user may wish to employ a variable aperture stop to trade sensitivity for angular resolution when measuring specular surfaces, since best angular resolution is needed near specular where BRDF has a steep slope. Best sensitivity is needed at larger angles where BRDF might approach the NEBRDF. 5.5.3 It may be necessary to use an optical bandpass filter on the detector to\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 5  Apparatus\n\nContent: minimize acceptance of background light. This can also be accomplished by modulating the amplitude (with a mechanical chopper) of the source light, and using a synchronized, phase sensitive (lock-in) amplifier with the detector. 5.5.4 Since depolarization can occur in scattering, complete characterization of scatter requires measurements with a polarization analyzer at the receiver. The scatter reflux can be broken into perpendicular and parallel components that are respectively perpendicular and parallel to the scatter plane (see Figure A1-2).\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: 6.1 General — Instrument calibration is often confused with measurement of $P _ { i }$ . Calibration of a BRDF instrument involves systematic standardization and verification of its quantitative results. Incident power must be measured for correct normalization of the scattered power. Absolute measurement of powers is not required as long as the $P _ { s } / P _ { i }$ ratio is correctly measured. Alternatively, a reference sample can be used as a normalization reference. 6.2 Calibration — A leading cause of inaccuracy in BRDF measurement is a lack of instrument calibration. An error analysis of the four quantities defining the BRDF $( P _ { i } , P _ { s } , \\varOmega , \\theta _ { s } )$ can help to accomplish a calibration.7 Each of these four independent variables is a function of system parameters. For example, $P _ { s }$ depends on receiver linearity, electrical noise and system alignment parameters. The total error is also a function of incidence angle and scatter angle.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: It is reasonable to expect errors in the 3 to $10 \\%$ range for measurements taken a few degrees from specular to about $\\theta _ { s } = 8 5 ^ { \\circ }$ . System nonlinearity is a major contributor to error in this central region. At either end of this central region errors rise dramatically. Near specular, this is caused by out of plane receiver position error, and near the grazing angle the increase is due to uncertainty in $\\theta _ { s }$ . Error is also a function of the type of sample being measured. For example, larger errors are expected in the relatively steep BRDF associated with specular samples than for the flatter response of a diffuse surface. 6.2.1 The receiver and preamplifier must be calibrated together over their useful operating range. The final result is a calibration curve showing relative optical power versus voltage for each preamplifier gain setting. Operating regimes are selected for each gain setting to avoid saturating the detector while remaining on\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: a low gain setting. The source monitor must also be calibrated in the same way. 6.2.2 There are several ways to vary the optical power and make this calibration curve. Optical filters with a known attenuation can be used, but multiple reflections and coherent effects (interference between the two filter faces) can change the attenuation. An excellent method of changing the optical power at the receiver is by moving away from a diffuse source for $1 / r ^ { 2 }$ attenuation. Other methods include crossed polarizers or changing the duty cycle of a chopper. The user must select an attenuation method with suitable reproducibility to perform the calibration. 6.2.3 The receiver and preamplifier each have a maximum output voltage to avoid saturation, but there is also a minimum electronic noise level which should be kept in mind to avoid reporting noise as BRDF. When electronic noise is expressed as NEBRDF, note that although the noise may be constant, NEBRDF depends on the receiver\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: solid angle, $\\Omega$ , the incident power, $P _ { i } ,$ and $\\cos \\theta _ { s }$ . This means NEBRDF can be lowered by changing these system parameters. 6.2.4 A full system calibration is not required on a daily basis, but the system should be checked daily. This check can be accomplished by measuring the instrument signature and a stable reference sample that provides data over several decades. Changes from past results are an indication of calibration problems and the cause of the change must be determined. It is good operating practice to maintain a reference sample at the scatter facility for this calibration check. Recalibration must be accomplished when components are changed, repaired, or realigned. Include a data file number for the most recent reference sample measurement with every set of BRDF data as a record of instrument response in case the data set is questioned at a later time. 6.3 Normalization — There are four acceptable methods for normalizing the scattered\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: power to the incident power. Each method is dependent on different measured parameters. 6.3.1 Absolute — An absolute normalization is made by moving the receiver assembly onto the optical axis of the source with no sample in the sample holder. This method depends on extending receiver calibration to high power levels. The entire incident beam must enter the receiver assembly and a voltage, $V _ { d i }$ , is recorded. If the unsaturated detector response is $R _ { \\lambda }$ (watts/volt): $$ P _ { i } = V _ { d i } R _ { \\lambda } $$ It is not necessary to know $R _ { \\lambda }$ for the sample BRDF calculation if it remains constant. The source monitor voltage, $V _ { m i }$ must also be recorded at this time. 6.3.2 Relative BRDF — A relative normalization is made by measuring a reference sample that has a known BRDF level. This method depends on knowing the reference sample BRDF. This reference sample is usually a high reflectance, diffuse surface. They are readily available\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: for visible wavelengths and the BRDF is the same for a large range of $\\theta _ { i }$ and $\\theta _ { s }$ . Ideally the reference sample has a known BRDF that is similar to the unknown sample to be tested in both magnitude and incident/scatter directions, but this is rarely true. The reference sample should be spatially uniform and isotropic to alleviate alignment concerns. 6.3.2.1 The reference sample is inserted in the sample holder and a detector voltage, $V _ { d i } ,$ corresponding to the scattered light for the known BRDF is recorded. The following can now be calculated: $$ P _ { i } = \\frac { V _ { d i } R _ { \\lambda } } { \\mathrm { B R D F } \\Omega \\cos \\theta _ { s } } $$ It is not necessary to know $\\Omega$ or $\\theta _ { s }$ for the sample BRDF calculation if they remain constant. The source monitor voltage, $V _ { m i }$ , must also be recorded at this time. 6.3.3 Relative Specular Reflectance — An alternative relative normalization can be made with a specular\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: reference sample having a known specular reflectance, $R$ . This method depends on knowing $R$ for the same collection solid angle as used in the $P _ { i }$ measurement. 6.3.3.1 Insert the specular reference sample in the sample holder and measure the detector voltage, $V _ { d i }$ , for the entire specular beam into the receiver assembly. The following can now be calculated: $$ P _ { i } = \\frac { V _ { d i } R _ { \\lambda } } { R } $$ It is not necessary to know $R _ { \\lambda }$ for the sample BRDF calculation if it remains constant. The source monitor voltage, $V _ { m i }$ , must also be recorded at this time. 6.3.4 Relative Total Reflectance — The fourth method involves integration of relative BRDF over the hemisphere and adjustment of constants to match the directional hemispherical reflectance, $\\rho$ (also referred to as total hemispherical reflectance). Normalization can only be accomplished after sufficient scatter data are accumulated to define the integral. This\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: method depends on a separately measured directional hemispherical reflectance and knowing relative scatter over the entire hemisphere. It is best suited to isotropic, diffuse samples. 6.3.4.1 When sufficient scatter data has been accumulated the following integral is performed. $$ \\rho _ { c a l c } = \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { 2 \\pi } \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { B R D F } \\cos \\theta _ { s } \\sin \\theta _ { s } \\mathrm { d } \\theta _ { s } \\mathrm { d } \\phi _ { s } $$ BRDF is obtained with constants, $V _ { d } R _ { \\lambda } / P _ { i } ,$ , removed from the integral. These constants are adjusted to make $\\rho$ equal to the externally measured $\\rho _ { \\mathrm { - } }$ . The constants are then returned to Equation 7 for calculation of absolute BRDF. 6.3.4.2 A perfectly reflecting $( \\rho = 1 )$ and diffuse sample has constant BRDF and integration of the above equation shows that it is equal to $1 / \\pi .$ A diffuse sample depolarizes incident plane polarized light, therefore\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 6  Calibration and Normalization\n\nContent: care must be exercised so that the polarization state of the light is taken into account for both the scatter and directional hemispherical reflectance measurements.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 7  Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 7  Procedure\n\nContent: 7.1 Sample cleanliness can be a significant factor in the scatter level. The user should adopt a procedure for cleaning samples prior to measurement and this cleaning procedure should be reported with the BRDF results. 7.2 Correct alignment of the source, sample, and receiver are essential for accurate BRDF measurements. A typical example of a subtle error that can be introduced by misalignment occurs when the receiver does not rotate in $\\theta _ { s }$ about the sample face. As $\\theta _ { s }$ increases, the receiver field-of-view “walks off” the illuminated area, $A$ , and the measured BRDF is then lower than actual BRDF. Although it is not necessary to perform a total system alignment every day, alignment must be verified on a daily basis for movable components. 7.3 After cleaning the sample and verification of alignment, the sample is inserted in the sample holder. The detector voltage, $V _ { d }$ , and the source monitor voltage, $V _ { m } ,$ are recorded for each parameter set of\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 7  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 7  Procedure\n\nContent: interest. For example, BRDF measured in the plane-of-incidence requires changing $\\theta _ { s }$ while holding other parameters constant. The measurement results consist of three columns of data for $\\theta _ { s } , V _ { d } ,$ and $V _ { m }$ . The constant parameters, $\\theta _ { i }$ and $\\phi _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ , are retained in the header information for this data set. Post processing is used to calculate BRDF and express the results in the desired tabular or graphical format, but $P _ { \\mathrm { { s } } }$ can be calculated at this time. In this calculation, the ratio of source monitor voltages is included to correct for variation of source intensity: $$ P _ { s } = { \\frac { V _ { d } R _ { \\lambda } V _ { m i } } { V _ { m } } } $$ where $V _ { m i } =$ source monitor voltage (see $\\ P [ 6 . 3 . 1 )$ . 7.4 BRDF can exhibit strong sensitivity to azimuthal orientation, spot size and position changes on the sample face. Good operating practice dictates checking for sensitivity to these\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 7  Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 7  Procedure\n\nContent: and other system parameters.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 8  Calculation\n\n8.1  The BRDF of an unknown sample is calculated at each incident and scattered direction from the following relationship:  \n$$\n\\mathrm { B R D F } = { \\frac { P _ { s } } { P _ { i } \\Omega \\cos \\theta _ { s } } } = \\left( { \\frac { V _ { m i } } { V _ { m } } } \\right) \\left[ { \\frac { V _ { d } R _ { \\lambda } } { P _ { i } \\Omega \\cos \\theta _ { s } } } \\right] [ \\mathrm { s r } ^ { - 1 } ]\n$$  \nThe value of $P _ { i }$ is determined by the normalization method used.  The correct angular variables may also be calculated in post processing with BRDF.  In all cases $\\theta _ { i }$ and $\\theta _ { s }$ are referenced to the sample normal.  \n8.2  Many facilities prefer to store only raw data and calculate BRDF and display variables as required to produce a graph or data table.  If data are sent to another facility, it is essential to convert to BRDF and the angular variables defined in this practice.  A suggested reporting format is given in Related Information 3.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 9  Report (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 9  Report\n\nContent: 9.1 BRDF data is expressed in tabular or graphical format as a function of the variable parameter. It is necessary to state the accuracy of angular measurements and the size of the receiver solid angle, $\\Omega$ . These latter parameters are important for small angle scatter. It is usually meaningless to measure within $1 ^ { \\circ }$ of specular or to measure very narrow “diffraction spikes” when $\\Omega$ spans several degrees. 9.2 It is necessary to furnish the instrument signature with the sample BRDF data so that the user can make an informed decision about the angle where the sample’s scatter becomes lost in the signature. Correct comparison of the signature with BRDF data requires multiplying the signature by the sample's specular reflectance for that portion of the signature due to instrument scattered stray light (usually the case for $\\theta _ { s }$ near specular). The portion of the signature due to electronic noise is not reduced by the sample reflectance. 9.3 It is necessary to furnish\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 9  Report (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 9  Report\n\nContent: the normalization method with BRDF data. If a relative normalization is used the source of the reference sample BRDF must be stated. 9.4 BRDF data can span many decades so it is usually expressed in base ten exponential form or plotted on a logarithmic scale. 9.5 Related Information 3 provides a reporting format suggested for use. This format is general in nature and allows for variation of any sample or system parameters.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 10  Precision and Bias (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 10  Precision and Bias\n\nContent: 10.1 Precision — The precision of the procedure outlined in this guide is inconclusive based on the results of an interlaboratory round robin conducted in 1988. This round robin was conducted at a single wavelength $( 6 3 2 . 8 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } )$ , angle of incidence $( 1 0 ^ { \\circ } )$ , polarization state ( $\\scriptstyle { \\dot { s } }$ incident) and with four specific sample surfaces. It was found that precision depends on the BRDF level and scatter angle.9 Additional information on precision was accumulated in a $1 0 . 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ round robin conducted in 1989.10 10.1.1 A white diffuse sample with mean $\\mathrm { B R D F } = 0 . 2 7 / \\mathrm { s r }$ gave a fractional deviation (standard deviation of the 18 measurement sets divided by the mean BRDF) close to $17 \\%$ at scatter angles from 15 to $7 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .

Specular mirrors gave fractional deviations from 31 to $134 \\%$ depending on scatter angle. Variations were larger at large scatter angles where detector noise levels of some instruments and errors in $\\theta _ { s }$ had a large effect. These variations are much larger then expected from a typical error analysis. 10.2 Bias — There is no bias inherent in this practice. BRDF is a number derived from the ratio of physical parameters that can be specified in absolute units. However, individual laboratories may have measurement errors that lead to systematic offsets, such as an inaccurately measured solid angle. Other possible mechanisms are discussed in the literature. It is not possible at this time to separate these systematic errors from bias; however, intralaboratory measurements on the same instrument typically repeat within $5 \\%$ .7\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # 11  Keywords\n\nbidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); diffuse; irradiance; power spectrum; radiance; reflectance; reflectance factor; roughness; scatter; specular; total integrated scatter\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # APPENDIX 1 GEOMETRY\n\nNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI ME1392.

R2-1.1.1 For an isotropic surface, measure in-plane BRDF at $\\theta _ { i } = 0$ and calculate the expected total integrated scatter by integrating over the angle limits specified in SEMI MF1048. $$ \\mathrm { T I S } _ { \\mathrm { c a l c u l a t e d } } = 2 \\pi R ^ { - 1 } \\int _ { 2 . 5 ^ { \\circ } } ^ { { \\mathrm { 7 0 ^ { \\circ } } } } \\mathrm { s B R D F s i n } \\theta _ { s } \\mathrm { d } \\theta _ { s } $$ R2-1.1.2 Sample specular reflectance, $R$ , must be included because total integrated scatter is referenced to reflected and not incident power. The $\\cos \\theta _ { s }$ term must be included because BRDF is defined in terms of the projected receiver aperture. This comparison between total integrated scatter and BRDF may\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-1  Total Integrated Scatter (TIS) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-1  Total Integrated Scatter (TIS)\n\nContent: not be exact since the total integrated scatter detector is less sensitive to light incident on the detector at large angles and if low $f$ (close to specular) scatter dominates, the $5 ^ { \\circ }$ hole size is critical. In addition a TIS instrument is not polarization selective.\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-2  Roughness\n\nR2-2.1  The rms surface roughness, $\\sigma ,$ is an often quoted number that can be obtained from direct profile measurements with stylus or optical profilometers.  It can also be inferred from total integrated scatter when, $\\sigma < <$ $\\lambda / 4 \\pi$ for front surface scatter from a clean, smooth surface,13 as described in SEMI MF1048.  \n$$\n\\sigma = \\left( { \\frac { \\lambda } { 4 \\pi } } \\right) ( \\mathrm { T I S } ) ^ { 1 / 2 }\n$$  \nR2-2.1.1  The user must confirm the usefulness of this $\\sigma$ calculation based on the particular measurement circumstances.  It may have strong frequency limitations and not agree with surface roughness derived from optical or mechanical profile instruments (which can have different spatial frequency limits14).\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-3  Power Spectrum (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-3  Power Spectrum\n\nContent: R2-3.1 The surface power spectral density function (PSD) can be calculated from the BRDF through a scatter model. For example, the grating equation model discussed in $\\ S \\ R 1 - 2$ shows that high frequency surface perturbations scatter light far from specular and low frequency perturbations scatter close to specular. The PSD shows the amount of modulation versus $f$ , that is, the square of the Fourier transform of the surface profile. Since it is a sample property, the same PSD should be obtained regardless of wavelength and incident angle dependent differences in the BRDF data. R2-3.2 Wavelength scaling is another check on system calibration. Smooth, clean, nonabsorbing front surface reflectors should yield the same PSD for different BRDF measurement wavelengths. If the instrument does not wavelength scale on appropriate samples, the BRDF measurement may be suspect. Polished molybdenum and silicon wafers are two examples of surfaces that have been shown to wavelength scale from the\n\nSEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-3  Power Spectrum (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI ME1392-0305 GUIDE FOR ANGLE RESOLVED OPTICAL SCATTER MEASUREMENTS ON SPECULAR OR DIFFUSE SURFACES - # R2-3  Power Spectrum\n\nContent: visible into the infrared.

When a beam of parallel, monochromatic X rays of wavelength $\\lambda$ is incident upon the planes, diffraction (reflection) occurs when the path difference of the $\\mathrm { \\Delta } \\mathrm { X }$ rays between adjacent planes is an integral number, $n$ , of wavelengths. When this geometrical condition is satisfied, the reflections from the various planes of the series are exactly in phase and the diffracted beam is of maximum intensity. Thus, as shown in Figure 1, the diffracted beam of X rays possesses maximum intensity when the angle of incidence, $\\theta ,$ of the beam with the reflecting planes, the X-ray wave-length, $\\lambda$ , the atomic interplanar spacing, $d$ , and the order of the diffraction, $n$ , simultaneously have values that obey Bragg’s law\n\nSEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 4.1  Summary of Test Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 4.1  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: as follows: $$ n \\lambda = 2 d \\sin \\theta $$ NOTE: Reflection conditions are as follows: $\\mathbf { N B } = \\mathbf { B M } = d \\sin \\theta ,$ ， $\\mathbf { N B } + \\mathbf { B M } = n \\lambda$ , $n \\lambda = 2 d \\mathrm { s i n } \\theta .$ 4.1.1.1 The reflecting planes are more commonly defined in terms of their Miller indexes $( h , \\ k , \\ l )$ . The Miller indexes are the smallest integers proportional to the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane on the three crystal axes of unit length. Thus, for any lattice structure where the periodicity is represented by a cubic unit cell of side length (lattice parameter), $a$ , the lattice spacing, $d$ , of a set of parallel atomic planes, may be written as follows: $$ d = \\frac { a } { \\sqrt { h ^ { 2 } + k ^ { 2 } + l ^ { 2 } } } $$ 4.1.1.2 The angle, $\\theta ,$ may then be found from the following modified form of Bragg’s law for cubic lattice structures: $$ \\sin \\theta = \\frac { n \\lambda \\sqrt { h ^ { 2 } + k ^ { 2 } + l ^ { 2 } } } { 2 a\n\nSEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 4.1  Summary of Test Method (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 4.1  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: } $$ 4.1.1.3 In the diamond cubic structure, to which silicon and germanium, the Group IV semiconductors, belong, and in the zinc blende structure, to which gallium arsenide and the other Group III–Group $\\mathrm { v }$ semiconductors belong, the following general rule gives the commonly observed reflections: $h , k ,$ and $l$ must be all even or all odd, with the further restriction that when $h , k ,$ and $l$ are all even, then $h + k + l$ must be divisible by four.

In semiconductive single crystals, where the cross-sectional plane of the crystal or the surface of a wafer cut from the crystal usually corresponds within several degrees to a low index crystallographic plane, such as a (100) or (111) plane, the orientation is frequently described in terms of the maximum angular deviation of the low index crystallographic plane from the mechanically prepared surface. Other crystallographic planes may be found with respect to this low index plane by using a table of angles between crystallographic planes of a cubic crystal. Such a table appears in ASTM Test Method $\\textnormal { E } 8 2$ . 4.1.3 The angular deviation of a reflecting plane from a prepared reference surface is found by determining two components of the deviation in two planes perpendicular to each other and to the\n\nSEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 4.1  Summary of Test Method (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 4.1  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: reference surface. Each of the deviation components represents a setting of the crystal lattice that satisfies Bragg's law for the particular $\\mathrm { \\Delta } \\mathrm { X }$ -ray beam configuration. The reference surface itself must be perpendicular to the plane of the incident and reflected beams. Initially, an orientation determination is made at any arbitrary position of the crystal. Then the crystal is rotated $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ of arc about the normal to the reference surface (the normal lying in the plane of the incident and reflected beams) and a second orientation determination made. The crystal is rotated another $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ of arc (in the same direction) and a third orientation determination is made. The crystal has now been rotated $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ of arc with respect to the starting point.

The specimen is placed in a holder so that the surface under investigation contains the axis about which the specimen is rotated in satisfying the Bragg law conditions. Rotations about this axis are measured on a scale in degrees and minutes of arc. The holder must also permit rotation of the specimen about a normal to the surface under investigation. The Bragg angle corresponding to the particular X-ray wavelength used, the material under investigation, and the particular family of planes being oriented must be known from Table 1 or be determined.

These pits are bounded by planes related to the principal crystallographic directions of the material. These limiting boundary planes determine the shape of the pits when the etched surface is near a major crystallographic direction. An optical examination of the facets comprising the pit walls relates the crystal surface under examination to this crystallographic direction, and further permits a determination of the degree of misorientation of the surface from the crystallographic plane. 5.1.2 A light beam that is reflected from such a preferentially etched surface may be focused upon a screen to form a definite geometric pattern characteristic of the surface etch pit structure.

Therefore, when the central reflected beam is aligned with the direction of the light beam, this crystallographic plane is perpendicular to the light beam direction. This observation permits orientation of the crystal along a desired crystallographic axis or, alternatively, allows the determination of the degree of misorientation of a crystal surface from a desired crystallographic plane.\n\nSEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 5.2  Reagents and Materials\n\n5.2.1  Purity of Water — Reference to water shall be understood to mean Type E-3 or better water as described in ASTM Guide D 5127.  \n5.2.2  Germanium Etchant Solution — Mix 1 part HF, 1 part $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ , and 4 parts water, by volume.  \n5.2.3  Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), $49 \\%$ , in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C28.  \n5.2.4  Hydrogen Peroxide $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } )$ ), $30 \\%$ , in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C30.  \n5.2.5  Potassium Hydroxide Solution (KOH), $45 \\%$ by weight in water, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C40.  \n5.2.6  Sodium Hydroxide Solution (NaOH), $50 \\%$ by weight in water, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C43.\n\nSEMI MF26-0305 TEST METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF A SEMICONDUCTIVE SINGLE CRYSTAL - # 5.3  Apparatus\n\n5.3.1  Light Beam — originating preferably from a high-intensity point source.  An image of the source shall be observed on a screen following reflection from a front surface mirror occupying the crystal test position.  This image establishes the zero reference point.

This edition was approved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005.  It was available at www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005.  Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 43-64T.  Last previous edition SEMI MF43-99.\n\nSEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1   The resistivity of a semiconductor material is an important materials acceptance requirement.  Resistivity determinations made during device fabrication are also widely used for quality control purposes.  \n1.2   These test methods cover two procedures which are widely used for making routine measurements.\n\nSEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 The two test methods in this standard are as follows: 2.1.1 Method A, Two-Probe — This test method requires a bar specimen of measurable cross section and with cross-sectional dimensions small in comparison with the length of the bar. For materials for which no specific referee method has been developed, this test method is recommended for materials acceptance purposes. 2.1.2 Method B, Four-Probe — This test method is rapid and does not require a specimen of regular cross section. This test method may be used on irregularly shaped specimens, provided a flat region is available for the contacting probes. As described in this standard, this test method is applicable only to specimens such that the thickness of the specimen and the distance from any probe point to the nearest edge are both at least four times the probe spacing. For the special case of specimens of circular cross section with thickness more than one, but less than four, times the probe spacing, measurements by this test method are possible; the required application\n\nSEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: of approximate geometric corrections results in improved accuracy (see $\\ P 1 0 . 1 . 3 )$ . 2.2 In general, resistivity measurements are most reliable when made on single crystals, since with such material local variations in impurity which affect the resistivity are less severe. Localized impurity segregation at grain boundaries in polycrystalline material may result in large resistivity variations. Such effects are common to either of the measurement test methods but are more severe with the four-probe test method, and its use, therefore, is not recommended for polycrystalline material. 2.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only. NOTE 1: DIN 50430 is an equivalent method to Method A and DIN 50431 is an equivalent method to Method B. NOTE 2: Other standardized test methods are preferred for use in various special circumstances. For measurements on thin wafers, use SEMI MF84; this method is preferred for referee measurements on silicon wafers. For\n\nSEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: measurements on specimens for which point contacts are unsatisfactory, use a procedure in ASTM Test Methods $\\yen 76$ based either on Van Der Pauw or bridge specimens. For two-probe referee measurements on cylindrical single crystal bars, use SEMI MF397. For four-probe referee measurements of sheet resistance on epitaxial layers deposited on or diffused or implanted into opposite conductivity-type substrates, use SEMI MF374.

It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 3   Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 3   Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 In making resistivity measurements, spurious results can arise from a number of sources. The following must be guarded against: 3.1.1 Photoconductive and photovoltaic effects can seriously influence the observed resistivity, particularly with nearly intrinsic material. Therefore make all determinations in a dark chamber unless experience has shown that the material is insensitive to ambient illumination. 3.1.2 Spurious currents can be introduced in the testing circuit when the equipment is located near high-frequency generators. If equipment is located near such sources, adequate shielding must be provided. 3.1.3 Minority carrier injection during the measurement can occur due to the electric field in the specimen. With material possessing high minority carrier lifetime and high resistivity, such injection can result in a lowering of the resistivity for distance of several centimeters. Carrier injection can be detected by repeating the measurements at lower current. In the absence of injection no increase in resistivity\n\nSEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 3   Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF43-0705 TEST METHODS FOR RESISTIVITY OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS - # 3   Limitations\n\nContent: should be observed. It is recommended that the current used in a resistivity measurement be as low as possible, consistent with the required precision. 3.1.4 Semiconductors have a significant temperature coefficient of resistivity. Consequently, the temperature of the specimen should be known at the time of the measurement and the current used should be small to avoid resistive heating. If resistive heating is suspected, it can be detected by a change in readings as a function of time starting immediately after the current is applied. Temperature coefficients for extrinsic germanium and silicon near room temperature are available in the literature. For referee purposes, it is recommended that the test be performed at $2 3 \\pm 0 . 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . NOTE 3: Temperature correction factors for silicon are given in tabular form in SEMI MF84 together with equations for generating the factors. 3.1.5 Vibration of the probes sometimes causes troublesome changes in the contact resistance.

This edition was approved for publication by the global Audits and Reviews Subcommittee on April 7, 2005.  It was available at www.semi.org in June 2005 and on CD-ROM in July 2005.  Original edition published by ASTM International as ASTM F 525-77T.  Last previous edition SEMI MF525-00a.\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1   This test method provides means for directly determining the resistivity of a substrate or of an epitaxial layer of thickness greater than 20 times the effective electrical contact radius.  Unlike SEMI MF84, SEMI MF374, and SEMI MF1392, it can provide lateral spatial resolution of resistivity on the order of a few micrometers.  \n1.2   This test method is intended primarily for use in process control, research, and development applications.  In the absence of between-laboratory precision data, this test method is not recommended for use between supplier and customer unless correlation experiments have been conducted between the parties.\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 2   Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 2   Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method covers the measurement of the resistivity of a silicon substrate of known orientation and type, or of a uniform silicon epitaxial layer of known orientation and type that is deposited on a substrate of the same or opposite type. Resistivity of the epitaxial films can be evaluated without the necessity of thin film correction factors provided that the ratio of layer thickness to effective probe contact radius is greater than 20. 2.2 This test method is comparative in that the resistivity of an unknown specimen is determined by comparing its measured spreading resistance with that of calibration standards of known resistivity. These calibration standards must have the same surface finish, conductivity type, and orientation as the unknown specimen. 2.3 This test method is intended for use on silicon substrates and epitaxial layers. Within-laboratory precision has been determined through a multilaboratory experiment on substrates having resistivities from 0.01 to $2 0 0 \\Omega\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 2   Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 2   Scope\n\nContent: \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ . 2.3.1 The principles of this test method can be extended to lower and higher specimen resistivity values, but the precision of the test method has not been evaluated for values other than those in the range given in $\\ P 2 . 3$ . 2.4 This test method is nondestructive in the sense that the specimen is not totally destroyed in making the measurements, the specimen need not be cut into a special shape, and no destructive processing need be done on the specimen. However, the probe can produce mechanical damage that may be detrimental to a device fabricated in the probed area. 2.5 The volume of semiconductor material sampled is proportional to the third power of the effective electrical contact radius of the probe. For an effective electrical contact radius of $2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , the volume sampled by a single probe is approximately $1 0 ^ { - 1 1 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ .

It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health guides and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 3   Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 3   Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Temperature — Spreading resistance measurements are sensitive to the temperature of the specimen. Therefore, it is important that the calibration and actual measurements be made at the same temperature. 3.2 Light — Photoconductive and photovoltaic effects can seriously influence the resistance determined by this test method, especially on wafers with $p { - } n$ junctions. All determinations shall be made in a dark chamber, or if experience shows that the material is insensitive to illumination of this type, in diffuse room light. 3.3 Radio-Frequency Fields — Spurious currents can be introduced in the testing circuit when the equipment is located near high-frequency generators. If equipment is located near such sources, adequate shielding must be provided. 3.4 Mechanical Vibrations — The apparatus may be sensitive to building or other vibrations. Therefore, the probe should be located in an area free from significant vibrations. It may be desirable to mount the probe assembly on a\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 3   Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 3   Limitations\n\nContent: vibration-free table. 3.5 Minority Carrier Injection — Caution should be taken to prevent minority carrier injection during the measurement. Experience has shown that if the potential on the probe is kept to $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ or less, minority carrier injection does not occur. 3.6 Reactive Atmosphere — Exposure of the probe or specimen to reactive atmospheres, such as those produced in the vicinity of epitaxial reactors or by high humidity, leads to changes in the characteristics of the instrument and to nonreproducible measurements. Probes and specimens shall be protected from such exposure. Relative humidity in excess of $60 \\%$ shall be avoided.\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 3.7   Semiconductor Surfaces\n\n3.7.1   Surface Instability — It has been found that spreading resistance measurements made on surfaces that have been exposed to an aqueous solution may be erratic.  Surfaces exposed to solutions containing fluorine ions may also exhibit instability.

The specimens tested were four (111) $p$ -type chips from about 0.05 to about $1 5 0 0 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ , six (111) $n$ -type chips from about 0.01 to about $5 0 0 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ , one (100) $n$ -type chip at about $1 0 \\ \\Omega { \\cdot } \\mathrm { c m }$ and three (100) $p$ -type chips from about 0.01 to about $1 0 \\ \\Omega { \\cdot } \\mathrm { c m }$ . Analyses of data to obtain estimates of random error were done separately for three categories of specimen preparation for which sufficient data were returned to obtain reliable estimates. In each category of specimen preparation, estimates of random error were obtained for the resistivity range from 0.01 to $2 0 0 \\ \\Omega { \\cdot\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 16   Precision and Bias (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 16   Precision and Bias\n\nContent: } \\mathrm { c m }$ ; estimates were not obtained from the two specimens of highest resistivity. 16.2 The two components of within-laboratory random error that were evaluated for each specimen preparation category and resistivity range are the repeatability, $\\sigma _ { r }$ , the relative standard deviation of a set of measurements obtained after a single preparation of a specimen, and the reproducibility, $\\sigma _ { R }$ , the relative standard deviation of measurement averages following re-preparations of a specimen. A summary of the estimates of these components based on the results of the multilaboratory experiment is given in Table 1, which gives the 90th percentile values for $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ in each category. The 90th percentile value is the value of $\\sigma _ { r }$ or $\\sigma _ { R }$ below which $90 \\%$ of the contributed values for that parameter in that category fall. It is expected to be a conservative estimate of $\\sigma _ { r }$ or $\\sigma _ { R\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 16   Precision and Bias (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 16   Precision and Bias\n\nContent: }$ about $90 \\%$ of the time for predicting the precision achievable by a well-controlled laboratory. The use of percentile distributions of the test data to obtain these estimates of $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ for the entire resistivity range results in a high value for the reproducibility value of silica-polished specimens which serves as a clear warning of the variability of results incurred with the silica process. 16.3 These components of random error and their propagation to estimate overall measurement precision are applicable only to single laboratory-operator-instrument circumstances. No estimate of interlaboratory precision was derived from this multilaboratory experiment. NOTE 10: These estimates of random error were based on data from laboratories that gave evidence of being in control of the specimen preparation and measurement processes. They are values that should be obtainable by any laboratory which is in control of the measurement process. However, they\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 16   Precision and Bias (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # 16   Precision and Bias\n\nContent: are superseded by whatever improved values of precision an individual laboratory can verify it obtains.

They are expected to be quite conservative estimates for measurements made at the upper end of this probe load range, and are expected to be less conservative for measurements made at the lower end of the range. There were too few data at ${ 5 } \\mathrm { g }$ in the multi-laboratory test to apply them with confidence to measurements made at this low a probe load. 16.4 Details of the analysis of the multi-laboratory test are given in Related Information 1.

They may also be used with values $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ derived from in-house experimentation to provide an estimate of the precision to be expected in a particular location.

For each specimen type used, the replicates were approximately 3 by $5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ chips cut from the central region of a single wafer. Each laboratory was requested to take and report 4 sets of 25 measurements each, on each of the specimens. Prior to each set of measurements, each specimen surface was to be reprepared by the participating laboratory's choice of one of the following procedures: (1) polishing with diamond—either planar polishing the entire specimen surface against an appropriate polishing pad or bevel polishing a portion\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT\n\nContent: of the specimen against a glass plate having a frosted surface, (2) polishing with silica in an aqueous medium—either the entire specimen surface against an appropriate polishing pad or on a beveled surface against a hard plastic surface, (3) lapping with alumina or garnet in water—either the entire specimen surface or on a beveled surface against ground glass or cast iron. Each laboratory was to report preparation procedure used, probe material used, probe load, all spreading resistance data and any additional observations thought to be pertinent to the analysis of the multilaboratory test. Since the experiment was run with parallel sets of specimens, no master calibration specimen set was included. To avoid possible confusion of analysis due to differing qualities of each laboratory's own calibration specimens, conversion of data to resistivity values was not required. R1-2 Table R1-1 summarizes the combinations of resistivity\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT\n\nContent: level, conductivity type, and crystallographic orientation for the specimens used in this multilaboratory test. Table R1-2 summarizes the probe material, probe load, and specific specimen preparation conditions; entries in this table are organized under general categories of specimen preparation. Table R1-1 Description of Silicon Specimens Used in Spreading Resistance Round Robin R1-3 Two quantities were calculated to characterize each laboratory's data on each specimen. The two quantities are $\\sigma _ { r } ,$ the average of the relative standard deviations from each set of 25 measurements, $\\mathrm { a n d } \\sigma _ { R }$ , the standard deviation of the 4 measurement averages on a given specimen, each expressed as a percent of the overall measurement average for that lab on that specimen. The first parameter is a measure of the repeatability, or freedom from scatter, of measurements on a fixed surface, assuming there is no\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT\n\nContent: inherent resistivity variation to the specimen over the area measured; the second parameter is a measure of reproducibility of measured value following independent specimen preparations and measurements. A summary of values of these parameters, as well as the grand averages of spreading resistance values are given in Table R1-3. The entries are organized under the general categories of specimen preparation used. Separate analyses of measurement precision were done for each category except for lapping with aluminum oxide; for this category there were insufficient data (only one laboratory) for a reliable analysis. Values of average spreading resistance are listed for completeness of record only; they were not used for data screening or for formal analysis. R1-4 A variety of choices of probe load, probe material, and specific details of specimen preparation are found to occur within each of the general specimen preparation categories.\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT\n\nContent: The number of laboratories that used any one specific set of specimen and probe conditions was too small to allow any reliable estimate of precision to be made for that set of specific conditions. Several assumptions were made regarding analysis of the data: (1) the data could be pooled within each general specimen preparation category without further regard for the specific details of specimen preparation or measurement condition, (2) the results of the analysis would represent estimates of the precision which could be expected by a laboratory in reasonable control of the spreading resistance instrumentation and of the chosen type of specimen preparation, and (3) within each specimen preparation category, estimates of $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ could be calculated that would apply to broad ranges of resistivity values without further respect to specimen crystallographic orientation or conductivity type.

To this end, within each specimen preparation category, all contributed values of $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ were rank ordered. Any laboratory which contributed significantly more than its expected fraction of the large values of either parameter was totally dropped from further analysis. (The only exception was Laboratory 3 in the diamond-planar-polished category. Although its data were generally higher than those from the other two laboratories, they were generally of reasonable absolute value and were likely due to the noticeably lower probe loads used by Laboratory 3.) As a result of this screening, data from the following laboratories\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT\n\nContent: were omitted from further analysis: diamond bevel polishing—Laboratory 6 and Laboratory 9 at $5 \\mathrm { g }$ , silica bevel polishing—Laboratory 11. R1-5.1 Plots of average values of $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ as a function of resistivity only are shown in Figure R1-1. These plots were obtained by simple averaging of all values of these parameters, as a function of specimen resistivity, for all laboratories whose data were not rejected. From these plots it is seen that single fixed values of $\\sigma _ { r }$ , or $\\sigma _ { R }$ , do not apply to the entire range of specimen resistivities measured. Each category of diamond polish appears to have a reasonably constant value of $\\sigma _ { r }$ or $\\sigma _ { R }$ , for the specimen range from 0.05 to $2 0 0 \\ \\Omega { \\cdot } \\mathrm { c m }$ .

R1-5.2 Re-examination of laboratory data for the two highest resistivity specimens indicated a strong possibility of resistivity variations in these two specimens as well as a variety of reported probe control problems that were not found with the lower resistivity specimens. It was therefore decided to omit the two highest resistivity specimens from further analysis. R1-6 Tests of the distribution of reported values of $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ within each category indicated that they had too much variability to be consistent with single underlying values of repeatability and reproducibility in any of the preparation categories. It is probable that some of this excess variability resulted from the variety of probe conditions and specimen orientations, conductivity types, and surface preparation details.\n\nSEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF525-0705 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON WAFERS USING A SPREADING RESISTANCE PROBE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE MULTILABORATORY EXPERIMENT\n\nContent: Nevertheless, the effect of this excess variability was that overall estimates of $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { R }$ could not be obtained from root-mean-square pooling of the respective variances.
