[0044] The embodiments of the present application are described herein with reference to cross-sectional views of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present application. It can be expected that some variations of the shown shapes may exist due to, for example, manufacturing techniques and/or engineering tolerances.

The regions shown in the drawings are schematic in nature, and their shapes are not intended to be the actual shapes of the regions of the device or limit the scope of the present application. In the present application, when mentioning that an element is \"located on\" a [0045] region of the semiconducting substrate, it means that this element is located corresponding to this region in the thickness direction of the semiconducting substrate, and that is, the projection of this element is located in the projection of this region on the plane perpendicular to the thickness direction of the semiconducting substrate. [0046] In the related art of the IBC solar cells, grooves are formed between adjacent perpendicular to the thickness direction of the semiconducting substrate. [0046] In the related art of the IBC solar cells, grooves are formed between adjacent Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, according to a first aspect of the present [0047] application, an embodiment of a solar cell 1 includes a semiconducting substrate 11, a first emitter 121, an insulating layer 13, and a second emitter 122. [0048] The semiconducting substrate 11 includes a first surface 11a and a second surface 11b that are opposite to each other. In use of the solar cell 1, the first surface 11a can be the back surface away from the sun, and the second surface 1lb can be the front surface facing the sun. The semiconducting substrate 11 includes a first region Iicand a second region 11d that are arranged adjacent to each other in a first direction X. The first direction X is a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction of the semiconducting substrate 11. The first region 11c includes a first sub-region 11c1 and a second sub-region 11c2 that are arranged adjacent to each other in the first direction X. The first sub-region 11el is in [0048] The semiconducting substrate 11 includes a first surface 1la and a second contact with the second region 11d. [0049] The first emitter 121 is disposed on the first surface 11a and located on the first 10 region 11c. The insulating layer 13 is disposed on the first emitter 121 and located on the first sub-region 11c. The second emitter 122 is disposed on the first surface 11a. The second emitter 122 includes a first sub-emitter 1221 and a second sub-emitter 1222, and the first and second sub-emitters 1221, 1222 are, e.g., physically and/or electrically, connected 15 with each other. In some embodiments, the first and second sub-emitters 1221, 1222 of the same second emitter 122 are together formed as an integrated structure. The first sub-emitter 1221 is located on the second region lid. The second sub-emitter 1222 is disposed on the insulating layer 13, and thus is located on the first sub-region 11ci. Electrical conduction is formed between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221. 20 It can be understood that a current leakage path can be formed between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221, so as to form the electrical conduction. 1221 can be achieved through following methods: As one method, the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221 are in direct contact with each other, so as to form the electrical conduction therebetween. As another method, an intermediate medium is disposed between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221, and the intermediate medium is capable of conducting the current from the first emitter 121 to the first sub-emitter 1221, or conducting the current from the first sub-emitter 1221 to the first emitter 121. conducting the current from the first sub-emitter 1221 to the first emitter 121. In some embodiments, the solar cell 1 further includes a first electrode 151 and [0051] a second electrode 152. The first electrode 151 is electrically connected to the first emitter 121, and the second electrode 152 is electrically connected to the second emitter 122. Since the electrical conduction is formed between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221, electrical conduction is formed between the first emitter 121 and the second emitter 122. Thus, a current leakage path can be formed in the solar cell 1 as follows: the electric current is conducted in sequence from the first electrode 151, through the first emitter 121, to the second emitter 122, and then to the second electrode 152; alternatively, the electric current is conducted in sequence from the second electrode 152, through the second emitter 122, to the first emitter 121, and then to the first electrode 151. Thus, in a group of solar cells connected in series, when one solar cell 1 is shaded and does not work, the current can flow through the current leakage path in this solar cell, thereby preventing the hotspot effect from occurring in the photovoltaic module, thus increasing the lifetime of the solar cell 1. sandwiching the insulating layer 13 between the first emitter 121 and the second sub-emitter 1222, the current leakage area between the first emitter 121 and the second emitter 122 can be reduced, thereby reducing the leakage current, which is conducive to enhancing the working efficiency of the solar cell 1. Moreover, during the preparation process of the solar cell 1, the insulating layer 13 can also protect the first emitter 121, reducing damage to the first emitter 121 in the preparation process, thus improving the structural integrity of the first emitter 121, which is thus beneficial for improving the performance of the solar cell 1. The first emitter 121 is in a first conductivity type, and the second emitter 122 is [0053] in a second conductivity type. In the first and second conductivity types, one is the p-type, and the other is the n-type. [0054] In some embodiments, the semiconducting substrate 11 can include a plurality of first regions 11c and a plurality of second regions 11d. The plurality of first regions 11c and the plurality of second regions 11d are arranged alternately along the first direction X. That is, there is one first region 11c between two adjacent second regions 11d, and there is one second region 11d between two adjacent first regions 11c. The adjacent first regions 11c Further, each first region 11c is provided with one first emitter 121, and each [0055] second region lid is provided with one second emitter 122. One first electrode 151 is disposed on each first emitter 121, and one second electrode 152 is disposed on each second emitter 122. In the embodiment that two second emitters 122 are respectively disposed at the two sides of one first emitter 121 along the first direction X, there are two insulating layers 13 respectively disposed on the two ends of this first emitter 121 along the first Referring to FIG. 1, in some embodiments, the first surface 11a includes a first [0056] sub-surface 11al located on the first region 11c and a second sub-surface 11a2 located on the second region 11d. The minimum distance between the first sub-surface 11al and the second surface 1lb is greater than the minimum distance between the second sub-surface 11a2 and the second surface 11b. In other words, the average height of the first sub-surface 11al is higher than the average height of the second sub-surface 11a2. In other words, the average thickness of the semiconducting substrate 11 in the first region 11c is greater than that in the second region 11d. In some embodiments, the first emitter 121 is disposed on the first sub-surface [0057] 11al, and the first sub-emitter 1221 is disposed on the second sub-surface 11a2. Along the first direction X, an orthogonal projection of the first emitter 121 on a first plane overlaps with an orthogonal projection of the first sub-emitter 1221 on the first plane, thus forming an overlapping area. The first plane is parallel to the thickness direction of the semiconducting substrate 11 and perpendicular to the first direction X. The first emitter 121 includes a sidewall adjacent to the second region 1ld, and electrical conduction is formed between the sidewall and the first sub-emitter 1221. In FIG. 1, the first plane is a vertical plane. In some embodiments, the solar cell 1 further includes a first tunneling layer [0058] 141 and a second tunneling layer 142. The first tunneling layer 141 is disposed between the first emitter 121 and the semiconducting substrate 11, and the second tunneling layer 142 is disposed between the second emitter 122 and the semiconducting substrate 11. A portion of the second tunneling layer 142 is disposed on the sidewall of the first emitter 121 that is adjacent to the second region I1d, and the portion of the second tunneling layer 142 is disposed between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221. first emitter 121 and the semiconducting substrate 11, and the second tunneling layer 142 is [0059] By providing the first tunneling layer 141 and the second tunneling layer 142, the interface state density between the semiconducting substrate 11 and either the first emitter 121 or the second emitter 122 can be reduced, thereby reducing the carrier recombination and enhancing the efficiency of the solar cell 1. Furthermore, a portion of the second tunneling layer 142 is located between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter\n\n[0037] Reference Signs: - 1221, constituting a section of the leakage current path.\n\nIn some embodiments, referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 3, the second tunneling [0060] layer 142 includes a first sub-tunneling layer 1421 and a second sub-tunneling layer 1422. The first sub-tunneling layer 1421 is disposed on the second sub-surface 11a2. The second sub-tunneling layer 1422 is disposed on the sidewall of the first emitter 121 that is adjacent to the second region 11d, and the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 is located between the first emitter 121 and the first sub-emitter 1221. Specifically, the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 is disposed on the sidewall of the first emitter 121 that is adjacent to the second region 11d. Thus, the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 constitutes a section of the leakage current path; that is, the leakage current passes through the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 during its conduction between the first electrode 151 and the second electrode 152. [0061] In some embodiments, referring to FIG. 1, the first sub-tunneling layer 1421 is spaced apart from the second sub-tunneling layer 1422; that is, the first sub-tunneling layer 1421 is not in contact with the second sub-tunneling layer 1422. Furthermore, the first sub-emitter 1221 covers at least the surface of the first sub-tunneling layer 1421 away from the semiconducting substrate 11, the sidewall of the first tunneling layer 141 adjacent to the second region 11d, and the sidewall of the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 adjacent to the second region 11d. It should be noted that, in the preparation of the solar cell 1, the first emitter 121 [0062] and the first tunneling layer 141 are formed first, followed by the second tunneling layer 142 and the second emitter 122. When the second tunneling layer 142 is formed by using a thermal oxidation method, the second tunneling layer 142 cannot be grown from the sidewall of the first tunneling layer 141, thus leaving the sidewall of the first tunneling layer 141 exposed. Thus, through the formation of the second emitter 122, the sidewall of the first\n\n[0037] Reference Signs: - tunneling layer 141 can be covered by the second emitter 122.\n\n[0063] In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 3, one end of the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 is connected to the first sub-tunneling layer 1421, while the other end of the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 extends in the direction away from the semiconducting substrate 11. The second sub-tunneling layer 1422 covers at least the sidewall of the first tunneling layer 141 adjacent to the second region lid, the sidewall of the first emitter 121 adjacent to the second region 1ld, and the sidewall of the insulating layer 13 adjacent to the second region 11d. The second tunneling layer 142 can further include a third sub-tunneling layer 1423, which is connected to, and e.g., in contact with, the second sub-tunneling layer 1422. The third sub-tunneling layer 1423 is located between the insulating layer 13 and the second sub-emitter 1222. In some embodiments, the first sub-tunneling layer 1421 and the second sub-tunneling layer 1422 are integrally formed. In some embodiments, the first sub-tunneling layer 1421, the second sub-tunneling layer 1422, and third sub-tunneling layer 1423 are integrally formed. [0064] Thus, the second tunneling layer 142 can be formed as a continuous structure by using a film deposition method, covering the second sub-surface 11a2, the sidewall of the first tunneling layer 141 adjacent to the second region 11d, the sidewall of the first emitter 121 adjacent to the second region 11d, the sidewall of the insulating layer 13 adjacent to the second region 11d, and the surface of the insulating layer 13 away from the semiconducting substrate 11. In some embodiments, referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the first electrode 151 is [0065] disposed on the side of the first emitter 121 that is away from the semiconducting substrate 11, and the first electrode 151 is electrically connected to the first emitter 121. The first electrode 151 is spaced apart from the insulating layer 13. The second electrode 152 is disposed on the side of the second emitter 122 that is away from the semiconducting substrate 11, and the second electrode 152 is electrically connected to the second emitter [0066] The first electrode 151 being spaced apart from the insulating layer 13 means that there is a distance between the surface of the insulating layer 13 adjacent to the first electrode 151 and the surface of the first electrode 151 adjacent to the insulating layer 13. In formation of the first electrode 151, an opening is laser-etched above the first emitter 121, and the opening is large enough to allow the first electrode 151 to be formed therein, so as to achieve a good ohmic contact between the first electrode 151 and the first emitter 121. In some embodiments, referring to FIG. 2, the sidewall of the insulating layer 13 [0067] adjacent to the first electrode 151 is spaced apart from the center of the first emitter 121 by a first distance S along the first direction X. The first distance S ranges from 3pm to 10000pm. Exemplarily, the first distance S can be 3m, 30pm, 40pm, 55pm, 65pm, 80pm, 90pm, 100pm, 1000pm, 10000m, or any value between these numbers.

Specifically, the preparation method includes S100 and S200:\n\n[0092] - material layer is phosphorus, and vice versa.\n\nincludes a first surface and a second surface opposite to each other. The semiconducting substrate includes a first region and a second region arranged adjacent to each other in a first direction. The first region includes a first sub-region and a second sub-region arranged adjacent to each other in the first direction. The first sub-region is in contact with the second region. The first direction is perpendicular to the thickness direction of the semiconducting substrate. Exemplarily, the material of the semiconducting substrate can be silicon. It can be understood that, in S100, a cleaning solution can be used to remove contaminants from the semiconducting substrate. In an example, the cleaning solution is an alkaline solution. [0093] In S200, first and second emitters are formed on the first surface, and an insulating layer is formed on the first emitter and on the first sub-region. The first emitter is formed on the first region. The second emitter includes a first sub-emitter and a second sub-emitter, and the first and second sub-emitters are connected with each other. The first sub-emitter is formed on the second region. The second sub-emitter is formed on the insulating layer. Electrical conduction is formed between the first emitter and the first sub-emitter, so as to form a current leakage path. [0094] In the solar cell and the the preparation method thereof provided by embodiments of the present application, the insulating layer is formed on the first emitter, the first sub-emitter of the second emitter is located on the second region, the second sub-emitter of the second emitter is formed on the insulating layer, and a current leakage path is formed between the first emitter and the first sub-emitter. In this way, on the one hand, in a group of solar cells connected in series, when one solar cell is shaded and does not work, the current leakage path in this solar cell allows the current to flow through, thereby preventing the hotspot effect in the photovoltaic module and increasing the lifetime of the solar cell. On the other hand, the insulating layer is sandwiched between the first emitter and the second sub-emitter, the current leakage area between the first emitter and the second emitter can be reduced, thereby reducing the leakage current, which is conducive to enhancing the working efficiency of the solar cell. Moreover, during the preparation process of the solar cell, the insulating layer can also protect the first emitter, reducing damage to the first emitter in the preparation process, thus improving the structural integrity of the first emitter, which is thus beneficial for improving the performance of the solar cell. In S210, a first tunneling material layer, a first emitter material layer, and a first oxidation method or a thermal oxidation method. Exemplarily, the first emitter material layer can be formed by one of the following two methods. In the first method, the first emitter material layer is formed by using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and the first emitter material layer can be formed to contain a doping element (such as boron or phosphorus); then, the first silicon oxide dielectric material layer is deposited on the first emitter material layer by using PECVD. In the second method, the first emitter material layer is formed by using low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), and the first emitter material layer may contain or not contain any doping element (such as boron or phosphorus). Exemplarily, the first heat treatment can be carried out at a temperature ranging [0098] from 700°C to 1100°C. If the first emitter material layer is formed using the first method as described above, the first heat treatment activates the doping element (such as boron or phosphorus) contained in the first emitter material layer, with the first silicon oxide dielectric material layer serving as a protection. If the first emitter material layer is formed using the second method as described above, there can be two scenarios. On the condition that the first emitter material layer contains a doping element (such as boron or phosphorus), the first heat treatment not only activates the doping element (such as boron or phosphorus), but also forms a first silicon oxide dielectric material layer on the first emitter material layer due to the high-temperature oxidation by the first heat treatment. On the condition that the first emitter material layer does not contain any doping element (such as boron or phosphorus), the doping element can be externally introduced into the first emitter material layer during the first heat treatment, for example, through boron diffusion or phosphorus [0099] In some embodiments, the material of the first tunneling material layer is silicon oxide, and the material of the initially deposited first emitter material layer is a mixture of 20 microcrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon. During the first heat treatment, the mixture of microcrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon further crystallizes to form a crystallized silicon material layer containing a dopant. [0100] In S220, the first silicon oxide dielectric material layer, the first emitter material layer, and the first tunneling material layer on the second region are removed. Exemplarily, the above regions of layers can be removed by using laser etching or wet etching. In S230, a second tunneling material layer, a second emitter material layer, and 5 [0101] a second silicon oxide dielectric material layer are formed as a stack on the first surface, and the semiconducting substrate with the stacked layers is subjected to a second heat treatment. Exemplarily, the second tunneling material layer can be formed by using a [0102] plasma oxidation method or a thermal oxidation method. Exemplarily, the second emitter 10 material layer can be formed by one of the following two methods. In the first method, the second emitter material layer is formed by using PECVD. The second emitter material layer can be formed to contain a doping element, which is different from the doping element contained in the first emitter material layer in doping type. For example, when the doping element of the first emitter material layer is boron, the doping element of the second emitter 15 material layer is phosphorus, and vice versa. Then, the second silicon oxide dielectric [0103] Exemplarily, the second heat treatment can be carried out at a temperature ranging from 700°C to 1100°C. If the second emitter material layer is formed using the first method as described above, the second heat treatment activates the doping element (such as boron or phosphorus) contained in the second emitter material layer, with the second silicon oxide dielectric material layer serving as a protection. If the second emitter material layer is formed using the second method as described above, there can be two scenarios. On the condition that the second emitter material layer contains a doping element (such as boron or phosphorus), the second heat treatment not only activates the doping element (such as boron or phosphorus), but also forms a second silicon oxide dielectric material layer on the second emitter material layer due to the high-temperature oxidation by the second heat treatment. On the condition that the second emitter material layer does not contain any doping element (such as boron or phosphorus), the doping element can be externally introduced into the second emitter material layer during the second heat treatment, for example, through boron diffusion or phosphorus diffusion, noting that the doping element introduced into the second can be formed during the second heat treatment. In some embodiments, the material of the second tunneling material layer is [0104] silicon oxide, and the material of the initially deposited second emitter material layer is a mixture of microcrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon. During the second heat treatment, crystallized silicon material layer containing a dopant. material layer, the second tunneling material layer, and the first silicon oxide dielectric 5 material layer in the second sub-region are removed. Exemplarily, the above regions of layers can be removed by using laser etching or wet etching. (including the second region and the first sub-region) on the first surface of the semiconducting substrate is removed. Thus, the first tunneling layer, the first emitter, the insulating layer, the second tunneling layer, and the second emitter are formed. The insulating layer is the first silicon oxide dielectric material layer remaining on the first emitter on the first sub-region. [0107] passivation layer is formed on the second surface. [0109] a second anti-reflection layer is formed on the second passivation layer. [0110] In S500, first and second electrodes are formed on the first surface. Specifically, conductive pastes can be printed in the areas corresponding to the first and second emitters and then sintered. During the sintering process, the first and second electrodes burn through the first passivation layer and the first anti-reflection layer to make contact with the first emitter and the second emitter, respectively. application, at least some of the steps can include multiple sub-steps or multiple stages, these sub-steps or stages are not necessarily performed at the same time, but may be performed at different times. These sub-steps or stages are not necessarily to be sequentially performed, but can be performed alternately or in turn with at least some of the sub-steps or stages of other steps. According to a third aspect of the present application, an embodiment of a [0112] photovoltaic module includes the solar cell described in any of the embodiments of the first aspect. [0113] Exemplarily, the photovoltaic module includes a plurality of solar cells, which can be connected in series through welding strips, thereby aggregating the electrical energy generated by individual solar cells for subsequent transmission. Specifically, the first electrodes of each solar cell are electrically connected to the second electrodes of an adjacent solar cell by welding strips, and the second electrodes of each solar cell are electrically connected to the first electrodes of another adjacent solar cell by conductive strips, so that the solar cells are connected in series. The solar cells can be arranged at intervals, or can be stacked together in an imbricated form. [0114] Furthermore, the photovoltaic module further includes an encapsulation layer and a cover plate (not shown). The encapsulation layer is configured to cover the surface of the solar cells connected in series. The cover plate is configured to cover the surface of the encapsulation layer away from the solar cells. The solar cells are electrically connected to form a whole piece or multiple pieces, such as forming a plurality of cell groups. The plurality of cell groups are electrically connected in series and/or in parallel. Specifically, in some embodiments, the plurality of cell groups can be electrically connected through conductive strips. The encapsulation layer covers the surface of the solar cells. Exemplarily, the encapsulation layer can be an organic encapsulation film, such as an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer film, a polyethylene-octene elastomer film, or a polyethylene terephthalate film. The cover plate can have a light-transmitting function, such as a glass encapsulation layer away from the solar cells. The solar cells are electrically connected to cover plate, a plastic cover plate, or the like. photovoltaic system includes the photovoltaic module in the third aspect. The photovoltaic system can be applied to photovoltaic power stations, such as [0116] ground power stations, roof power stations, water surface power stations, etc. Alternatively, the photovoltaic system can be applied to equipment or devices that use solar energy to generate electricity, such as user solar power supplies, solar street lights, solar cars, solar buildings, etc. It can be understood that the application scenarios of the photovoltaic system are not limited to the above, that is, the photovoltaic system can be applied in all fields that need to use solar energy to generate electricity. Taking a photovoltaic power generation network as an example, the photovoltaic system can include photovoltaic arrays, a combiner box, and an inverter. The photovoltaic array can be an array of multiple photovoltaic modules. For example, the multiple photovoltaic modules can form multiple photovoltaic arrays. The photovoltaic arrays are connected to the combiner box, which can combine the currents generated by the photovoltaic arrays. The combined current flows through the inverter and is converted into the alternating current suitable for the power grid, and then connected to the power grid to realize solar power supply.
