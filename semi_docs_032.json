The parallel input/output (PI/O) control signals between the production equipment and the AMHS must be better defined for more reliable and efficient carrier handoffs (load/unload) at production equipment load ports.  \n1.2  The purpose of this specification is to enhance the capabilities of the parallel I/O interface defined in SEMI E23 in order to support improvements in the reliability and efficiency of carrier transfer. The enhanced capabilities include continuous handoff, simultaneous handoff, and the capabilities of error detection on the interface.  \nNOTE 1:  The specifications in this document shall be considered independent from the specifications in SEMI E23; therefore use of this specification does not require SEMI E23."

This scope also extends to interbay AMHS active equipment (i.e., OHS and stockers equipped with transfer devices) and passive equipment (i.e., OHS and stockers not equipped with transfer devices). This specification defines the enhanced parallel I/O interface signals used to handoff carriers between the production equipment and the AMHS.

Carrier transfer throughput and efficiency is higher if more than one carrier is transferred at the same time. Carrier transfer time is also reduced if the intrabay AMHS equipment can deliver two or more carriers at the same time from one parked position. Typically internal buffer equipment that allows hand-off of two carriers to two load ports either simultaneously or continuously can best take advantage of these throughput improvements. Thus, internal buffer equipment will require either one PI/O per load port (Figure A1-3, Concept A) or one PI/O per two load ports (Figure A1-3, Concept B), depending on the AMHS delivery system.

In both cases, it is difficult to describe a general way for the host and equipment to specify which particular entity is referenced and to get information related only to a specific one out of many.  \n7.1.2  By defining these entities as objects that comply with OSS, it is only necessary for the host to specify the type of object and its specific identifier in order to inquire about one or more properties of the specific entity of interest."
