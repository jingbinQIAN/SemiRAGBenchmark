Description of the Related Art - DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nDistillation of brine takes place in two stages. There are four layers in the membrane distillation system: heat con- duction, porous hydrophobic membrane, evaporator and. condenser. The heat absorbed by a concentrated photovol- taic (CPV) panel is transmitted to the evaporator layer through the heat conduction layer. Brine, which passes into the vapor phase in the evaporator section, is distilled in the porous hydrophobic membrane system and condensation occurs in the condenser section, completing clean water production, The second evaporation layer receives brine from a brine tank and allows flow of brine from the second evaporation layer to the first evaporation layer. The first condensation layer and the second condensation layer allows fluid flow to a clean water tank. The first evaporation layer allows fluid flow into a con- centrated tank. Aclean water production method, in another embodiment, includes producing heat through a photovoltaic panel; receiving brine through a first evaporation layer of a first membrane distillation system located under the photovoltaic layer, and allowing brine to flow to a second evaporation layer of a second membrane distillation system located under the first membrane distillation system; allowing brine to flow through a first porous hydrophobic layer and first condensation layer of the first membrane distillation system; allowing brine to flow through a second porous hydrophobic layer and second condensation layer of the second mem- brane distillation system; allowing clean water to flow from the first condensation layer and the second condensation layer to a clean water tank; and generating electricity with a thermoelectric generator located under the second mem- brane distillation system. With the membrane system, each of which works in this way, the CPV panel is prevented from reaching very high temperatures and a performance increase is achieved in electricity production as the CPV panel becomes more efficient with the removal of the heat. The thermoelectric generator (TEG) is assembled on the bottom surface of the membrane distillation system in order to ensure the recovery of waste heat in the system operating in this way. Water that cannot be distilled from salt (concentrated water) is con- veyed to a tank to prevent salt accumulation in the mem- brane system. In addition, the produced clean water is transferred to two different tanks and nanoparticles are added to one of these tanks. The clean water, which is cooled before entering the tank, is a nanofluid with high thermo- physical properties by adding nanoparticles in the tank and is a part of the heat sink system required for TEG’s elec- tricity generation. A porous media channel has been designed in the heat sink system and the cooling performance increases with the nanofluid flow. The heat source of TEG will be created by waste heat from the membrane distillation system. The nanofluid exiting the heat sink design at high temperature is cooled again before entering the nanofluid tank, thus ensur- ing the continuity of the TEG/channel system. In the CPV/ MSMD design, the MSMD is covered with insulation mate- rial and heat losses are not allowed. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a concentrated photo- voltaic, membrane distillation, thermoelectric channel sys- tem 100. The system includes a photovoltaic panel 105, membrane distillation system 110@,1106, a thermoelectric generator 115 and a porous material channel 120. The system 100 is insulated with insulators 125 around mem- brane distillate system 110a, 1105. layer. A nanofluid layer 620 is located beneath the thermo- electric generator 615 and acts as a heat sink. It is to be understood that the present subject matter is not limited to the specific embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the generic language of the following claims enabled by the embodiments described herein, or otherwise shown in the drawings or described above in terms sufficient to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the claimed subject matter. Brine is supplied to the system 100 from a brine tank 130. The brine is heated by the photovoltaic panel 105 and flows through the membrane distillation system 110a,1105. The thermoelectric generator 115 converts heat being generated within the system 100 into electricity. A portion of the clean water from the membrane distillation system 110a,110b is stored into a clean water tank 135. Another portion of the clean water flows through a chiller 140 to a nanofluid tank 145 where nano particles are added to the nanofluid. The combined clean water and nanoparticles flow through a porous material channel 120 acting as a heat sink for the thermoelectric generator 115. The heated clean water and nanoparticles flow through a chiller 150 and back to the nanofluid tank 145. 15 20 We claim: 1.
