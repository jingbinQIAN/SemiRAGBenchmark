Only the physical interfaces for FOBIT are specified; no materials requirements or micro-contamination limits are given. However, this standard has been written so that both metal and injection-molded plastic FOBITs can be manufactured in conformance with it. 2.2 This standard assumes that the FOBIT is intended for use in the interfactory transportation of wafers. The following boundary conditions were used in the creation of this specification: Minimizing the pitch between wafers will reduce the cost of transporting wafers. The FOBIT will be used for interfactory transportation of both processed and unprocessed wafers. The box will have a 25-wafer capacity.

This may be needed to prevent the FOBIT from being knocked off the kinematic couplings by the action of pushing the FOBIT against the front-opening interface. The front retaining feature contains a ramp that a wheel might roll up while the FOBIT is being pushed toward the front-opening interface.

The most important concept is Little’s law given in the following equation, which is the same as Equation 15 in Section 6: $$ \\binom { a \\nu e r a g e } { W I P } = \\binom { a \\nu e r a g e } { c y c l e t i m e } \\times \\binom { a c t u a l } { t h r o u g h p u t r a t e } $$ R1-1.2 In Factory Physics1, this identity is called the $\\cdot F = m a ^ { , }$ of manufacturing science. Little’s law relates the three most significant fundamental quantities of production systems. Unfortunately, it says that all three metrics cannot be optimized simultaneously. Little’s law is shown graphically in Figure R1-1. In all of the figures in this Related Information, the colors denote different values of the normalized production efficiency metric with green representing values close to one (at the bottleneck throughput rate and"

This guide focuses on evaluating production; utilization of assets and costs (as well as other economic factors) are outside its scope. For measuring effectiveness of asset use, an average (over all of the equipment in the factory) of overall equipment efficiency (OEE) weighted by cost of ownership (COO) can be defined in one of those documents. However, the use of consumables, utilities, and human resources would still need to be comprehended. For measuring costs, some other new standard might define a new metric (like COO) for the cost of factory ownership in such terms as $\\$ 5,$ /(good wafers), $\\$ 5$ (good chips), $\\$ 8$ /(metal levels), \\$/(good transistors), $\\$ 8$ circuit, or $\\mathbb { S } / \\mathrm { b i t }$ .

It is a guide for establishing electrostatic compatibility in facilities used for semiconductor manufacturing. 1.2 Electrostatic surface charge causes a number of undesirable effects in semiconductor manufacturing environments. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) damages both products and reticles. ESD events also cause electromagnetic interference (EMI), resulting in equipment malfunctions. Charged wafer and reticle surfaces attract particles (electrostatic attraction or ESA) and increase the defect rate. Charge on products can also result in equipment malfunction or product breakage. Operating problems and additional product defects due to static charge can have a negative impact on the cost of ownership of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (refer to SEMI E35). 1.3 For product and reticle protection or EMI control, the measurement of the ESD risk"

The nature of the object (insulator or conductor), its geometry, its surroundings, and the measuring equipment itself, are only a few of the factors affecting the accuracy of an electrostatic measurement. In general, direct measurement of static charge is possible with small, moveable objects. Larger objects, and those fixed in position, will need to be characterized by the electric field that results from the static charge. 3.2 Location — The test methods for static charge and maximum recommended levels of static charge on facility surfaces are meant to be applied after the facility has been built. Testing the performance of static control methods may be done before or after construction. It may be difficult to directly relate the performance of the static control method to the static charge level that results in the completed facility."

It will be difficult to determine levels that guarantee static related problems are totally eliminated.  The goals of this guide are to assist the user in identifying static charge levels likely to cause problems in the semiconductor manufacturing facility, and to direct the user to static control methods appropriate to mitigate these problems.

Part of a product (e.g., epoxy package) or reticle (e.g., quartz substrate) may become charged and induce charge separation to occur on another part of the product (e.g., lead pins) or reticle (e.g., chrome traces). ESD will occur if the lead pins or chrome traces contact ground. Using a coulombmeter or Faraday Cup and the methods of SEMI E43, the end user should test product or reticles to determine the level of static charge at which ESD damage occurs. 6.3.2 Alternatively, either the product or reticles may be handled in proximity to another charged object. The field from this charged object induces charge on product or reticles, and ESD can result if the product or reticle contacts ground while in the presence of the field.

A changing electric field can result at the reticle when an object in proximity to the reticle acquires a charge, the reticle or a charged object are in motion with respect to each other, or grounding conditions change the field between a charged object and the reticle (for example, due to robot handling). See references in Related Information 2. In areas of the manufacturing facility that produce or handle reticles, electric field from any charged object will need to be limited to levels that do not cause reticle ESD damage.

The substrate is easily charged, creating an electric field. The field changes whenever the spacing between the photomask and ground changes (e.g., during handling by robotics). Transporting the photomask, whether in static dissipative reticle carriers or not, exposes it to changing electric fields from other charged objects (e.g., equipment panels, windows, work surfaces, and equipment parts).

A1-2.8.3 The discharge test specified in IEC/TS 61000-4-2 is done at significantly higher charge levels than are recommended for objects in the facility in Table A1-2 of this Appendix. If the recommendations of Table A1-2 are followed, static charge levels should be low enough to prevent ESD-induced equipment malfunctions. A1-2.8.4 If the recommended electrostatic levels regarding ESD contained in Section 12.5 Table 1 are not used, those contained in SEMI E78 should be used for equipment."

    "content": "R1-1.1.1  ESD damage to devices occurs when they come into contact with personnel and facility or equipment surfaces.  Either may store a residual charge large enough to destroy the device if a discharge occurs. It is also possible that charge stored on insulating parts of products or reticles will induce charges on their conductive parts.  Discharges may occur between conductive parts at different potentials or when the conductive parts touch ground.  The same types of induced charge can be produced when products or reticles are placed in the electrostatic field produced by static charge on facility or equipment surfaces that are insulative or isolated from ground. In the semiconductor industry, it has been established that significant proportions of customer field returns are attributed to damage resulting from ESD."

The apparent similarity in current-induced damage resulting from ESD due to human body model (HBM) discharges or machine model (MM) discharges results from the thermal nature of both of these processes. The HBM and MM damages result when the temperature (joule heating) of the region dissipating the ESD pulse energy reaches a critical value and melting occurs. R1-1.2.2 The charged device model (CDM) predicts charge-induced phenomena. For CDM-type discharges, oxide punch through occurs when the ESD voltage applied across the oxide creates a high enough field to break down the oxide. Excessive current flow results, causing an oxide short, but there is no heat transfer (adiabatic process). It should be noted here that the time duration for typical ESD events from charged objects and"

The model attempts to replicate the discharge when a charged human touches a device that is at a lower potential. Human capacitance and resistance have been chosen to be $^ { 1 0 0 } \\mathrm { ~ \\ p F ~ }$ and $1 5 0 0 ~ \\Omega$ respectively. The values were chosen after measurements were made on humans in varying positions with respect to their surroundings. The resulting discharge waveform has a double exponential shape with rise time range of 2–10 ns and a decay constant ( $\\mathrm { 1 / e }$ position) of $1 5 0 \\pm 2 0$ ns. The typical peak currents range from 0.67 A at $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { V }$ to 2.67 A at 4000 V.

A capacitance of $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p F }$ and ideally zero resistance produces a sinusoidal decaying waveform with an effective pulse duration of 200 ns. The typical peak currents range from 1.75 A at $1 0 0 { \\mathrm { V } }$ to $1 4 . 0 \\mathrm { A }$ at $8 0 0 \\mathrm { V }$ . Note that MM failures occur at 5–10 times lower voltage than HBM. R1-1.3.3 Charged Device Model (CDM) — The CDM in its purest form is actually a field-induced model because the device is actually part of model. This model attempts to describe a device which itself becomes charged due to an external field, or due to triboelectric charging of the device surfaces. During discharge the parasitics (i.e., capacitance, inductance and impedance) in the device play a significant role in the resulting failure. The discharge pulse is a sinusoidal waveform with an extremely fast rise time of less than $5 0 0 \\mathrm { p s }$ . The waveform decays rapidly"

R1-1.3.4 Correlation Between Models — Whether or not a correlation exists between HBM and MM is debatable. While some companies report a correlation of roughly 10:1 between the two models, other companies have seen anywhere from 5–20:1 differences in passing voltages between the two models. There is also no established voltage correlation between CDM damage and HBM or MM ESD events. In equipment, ESD damage events will be related to the MM or CDM types of ESD. Users will need to determine the type of ESD hazard to their devices and choose the test method accordingly."
