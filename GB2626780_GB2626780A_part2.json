Electrical modules are known which have an embedded semiconductor element such as a power semiconductor. The semiconductor element is embedded in an encapsulation which may consist of a molding material or printed circuit board (PCB) material. On a top side of the electrical module electrical contacts are formed which serve to electrically connect the electrical module with respective electrical contacts on a PCB. The bottom side of the electrical module forms a thermal interface and is adapted for thermal contacting a heat sink. The bottom side is electrically insulated with respect to the semiconductor element. Such electrical modules are also referred to as prepackage modules. Typically, a plurality of prepackage modules are integrated into an electronic component such as an inverter and are cooled by a common heat sink. A problem associated with the arrangement of a plurality of prepackage modules ona heat sink lies in that the prepackage modules and their respective thermal interfaces are typically misaligned to some extent, ¢.g., because adjustment of the prepackage modules at the underside of a printed circuit board may include tolerances and tilting. To adjust for the misalignment, it is known to place a thermal interface material (TIM) between the thermal interface of the prepackage module and the heat sink. The greater the tilt, the thicker the thermal interface material that must be used between the prepackage module and the heat sink. However, such thermal interface material reduces the heat transfer from the thermal interface into the heat sink, such that there is a desire to minimize the thickness of such thermal interface material or avoid it altogether. The problem underlying the present invention is thus to provide for a device and method that allow to align thermal interfaces of electronic modules to provide for efficient coupling to a heatsink. This problem is solved by an electrical device with the features of claim 1 and a method with the features of claim 12. Embodiments of the invention are identified in the dependent claims.\n\nSummary of the disclosure\n\nAccording to an aspect of the invention, an electrical device is provided. The electrical device comprises at least one electrical module that comprises a semiconductor element, electrical contacts on a top side and a thermal interface (also referred to as cooling surface) on a bottom side. The electrical device further comprises electrical connectors each having a first end and a second end, wherein the first ends are connected to the electrical contacts of the electrical module and the second ends are adapted for THT connection or press-fit connection. Further, a mold part is provided which embeds the electrical module and the electrical connectors, wherein the mold part has a top side and a bottom side. The second ends of the electrical connectors stick out of the mold part top side for THT connection or press-fit connection to a neighboring element such as a printed circuit board. It is further provided that the at least one electrical module is arranged such in the mold part that its thermal interface flushes with the mold part bottom side or protrudes from the mold part bottom side without being covered by material of the mold part. Aspects of the invention are thus based on the idea of integrating at least one electrical module and associated electrical connectors into a mold part, wherein the thermal interface of the electrical module is located at an outer side (the bottom side) of the mold part and is not covered by the mold part such that it can be coupled in a clearly defined orientation to a heat sink. In case that several electrical modules are comprised in the electrical device, the thermal interfaces of the electrical modules are aligned with each other as they are all arranged at the mold part bottom side, without one thermal interface being tilted with respect to another thermal interface. This allows to couple the thermal interfaces in a most efficient manner to a common heat sink, with a minimal thickness of a thermal interface material or avoiding a thermal interface material altogether. Another advantage associated with the present invention lies in that an efficient connection of the electrical modules to a printed circuit board or main board can be achieved through THT connection or press-fit connection of the second ends of the electrical connectors which stick out of the mold part top side. THT refers to through-hole technology which is a manufacturing scheme well known to the skilled person in which leads are inserted through holes in PCBs and soldered or otherwise attached to PCB contacts. Press-Fit technology is also well known to the skilled person and uses press-fit pins to provide for module contacts to a PCB. The basic principle is a greater expansion of a press-fit zone compared to the corresponding PCB hole. The press-fit process plastically deforms a terminal pin and ensures a typically gas-tight contact with low resistance. It is pointed out that as “top side” of the mold part and electrical device is defined that from which the second ends of the electrical connectors stick out, irrespective of the actual orientation of the mold part and the electrical device. In a similar manner, the top side of the electrical module is that side that comprises the electrical contacts for contacting the semiconductor element irrespective of the actual orientation of the electrical module. According to an aspect of the invention, the electrical connectors are formed as stamped and bended sheet metals. With the electrical connectors formed as stamped sheet metals, they provide an inherent stiffness which allows to clearly define their design. In particular, the course of the electrical connector between the first end and the second end can be clearly defined as well as the orientation between the first end and the second end. However, in principle, the electrical connectors may be formed in a different manner, such as by wires. In a further embodiment, the electrical connectors are coined at their first ends at which they are attached to contacts of the electrical module. Coining the electrical connectors at the first ends means in particular that the diameter of the electrical connector is reduced at the first end. This allows to apply heat to a limited amount of material and thus in a more efficient manner, e.g., when soldering the first ends to respective electrical contacts of the electrical module. The electrical connectors may be connected to the respective electrical contacts of the electrical module by means of soldering or laser welding. Other connection techniques may be used as well. In a further embodiment, the mold part is a thermally conductive plastic material, wherein the thermal conductivity of the mold part lies in the range from 1 W/mK to 100 W/mK, in particular from 1 W/mK to 10 W/mK. By implementing the mold part by a thermally conductive plastic material, it is possible to conduct heat produced by the electrical connectors or the connection of the electrical connectors with the electrical contacts of the electrical modules to the thermal interface, and, from the thermal interface to a heat sink. The accumulation of heat in the mold part can thus be prevented. As a thermally conductive element, e.g., graphite may be added to a plastic material. In further embodiments, the plastic material used for the mold part also has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, thereby reducing stresses in case of temperature changes. In an embodiment, the electrical connectors each comprise a flat section which is configured to receive during manufacture a spring-loaded tool pushing the electrical connector downwards. The flat section runs parallel to the bottom side of the electrical device and typically perpendicular to the second end of the electrical connector. It allows a spring-loaded tool to apply a force in order to adjust the position of the electrical connector and, thereby, of the electrical module. In an embodiment, the electrical connectors each further comprise a springy section which is arranged between the first end and the flat section and configured to connect the first end and the flat section in a resilient manner. In embodiments, the springy section is formed by a curved section or V-shaped section of the electrical connector. By providing resilience to the electrical connector, the danger to damage the electrical module when applying a force through a spring-loaded tool during manufacture is reduced. In a further embodiment, the second ends of the electrical connectors extend perpendicular to the first ends, and also perpendicular to the flat section. This allows that the second ends of the electrical contacts stick out of the electrical device perpendicular to the top surface of the electrical device for efficient connection to a PCB. In a further embodiment, at least one of the electrical connectors extends from one side of the electrical module and at least one of the electrical connectors extends from the opposite side of the electrical module, thereby providing a symmetry or kind of symmetry regarding the position of the electrical module between the electrical connectors. This allows easier handling of the intermediate structure formed by the electrical module and the electrical connectors during manufacture. In an embodiment, the electrical module comprises a power semiconductor element, wherein the electrical module is contacted by three electrical connectors that provide a gate voltage, a drain voltage and a source voltage for the power semiconductor element. In such case, for example, two of these electrical connectors are connected to one side of the electrical module and the third of these electrical connectors is connected to the opposite side of the electrical module. It is pointed out that the present invention is not limited to electrical modules comprising power semiconductors. Depending on the kind of semiconductor, a different number of electrical connectors can be provided for for contacting the electrical module. In an embodiment, the electrical device comprises a plurality of electrical modules, wherein the respective thermal interfaces of the electrical modules are arranged in the same plane such that they can be effectively thermally coupled to a heat sink without tilting between the different electrical modules and respective thermal interfaces. In a further aspect of the invention, a method of manufacturing an electrical device is provided. The method comprises: - providing at least one intermediate structure that comprises an electrical module and electrical connectors connected to the electrical module, wherein the electrical module comprises a semiconductor element, electrical contacts on a top side and a thermal interface on a bottom side, and wherein the electrical connectors each have a first end and a second end, the first ends being connected to the electrical contacts of the electrical module and the second ends extending perpendicular to the first ends, - placing one or several such intermediate structures in an opened molding tool, wherein the molding tool comprises a core element and a slider element, wherein the slider element is configured to move towards and away from the core element in order to close and open the molding tool, wherein the core element comprises an interior surface, and wherein the slider element comprises a plurality of spring-loaded tools extending towards the core element and further comprises a plurality of holes, - closing the molding tool, wherein the slider element is moved towards the core element, wherein the spring-loaded tools of the slider element contact the intermediate structure, thereby pushing the intermediate structure including the electrical module downward such that the bottom side of the electrical module is pushed flatly against the interior surface of the core element, and wherein the second ends of the electrical connectors extend into the holes in the slider element, - injecting a casting compound into the molding tool, wherein the at least one intermediate structure is overmolded by the casting compound without the casting compound covering the thermal interface at the bottom side of the electrical module which lies flatly against the interior surface of the core element, - curing of the casting compound with formation of a mold part embedding the electrical module and the electrical connectors, wherein the mold part, the electrical module and the electrical connectors form an electrical device, and\n\nopening the molding tool and the removing the electrical device.\n\nAs the thermal interfaces at the bottom side of the electrical modules are not covered by the casting compound during molding, and as the thermal interfaces lie flatly against the interior surface of the core element, they are fully aligned. The inventive method thus produces a device in which the thermal interfaces lie within one plane and are not tilted with respect to each other, thereby allowing optimal thermal coupling to a heat sink. In an embodiment of the inventive method, the electrical connectors each have a flat section between the first end and the second end, wherein the method further comprises: - before closing the molding tool, placing the one or several intermediate structures such on the interior surface of the core element that the spring-loaded tools of the slider element are arranged adjacent to the flat sections of the electrical connectors, - _ wherein when closing the molding tool the spring-loaded tools of the slider element contact the flat sections of the electrical connectors, thereby pushing the electrical connectors and thus the electrical module downward such that the bottom side of the electrical module is pushed flatly against the interior surface of the core element. Accordingly, the flat sections of the electrical connectors are contacted by the spring- loaded tools (which may be spring-loaded pins), take up the downward force and direct it to the electrical module such that the electrical module is pushed flatly against the core element interior surface at its bottom side. In an embodiment, the method further comprises thermally coupling the thermal interface at the bottom side of the electrical module of the electrical device to a heat sink. The thermal coupling may include placing a thermal interface material between the thermal interface and the heat sink. Because all thermal interfaces are aligned, such thermal interface material may be thin. In an embodiment, the method further comprises connecting the second ends of the electrical connectors to a printed circuit board by means of a THT connection or press-fit connection. In a further embodiment, a plurality of intermediate structures are placed on the interior surface of the core element, wherein each of the bottom sides of the electrical modules of the intermediate structures are pushed flatly against the interior surface of the core element, thereby aligning the bottom sides of the electrical modules to lie within exactly one plane. In a further embodiment, the electrical connectors each comprise a springy section which is arranged between the first end and the flat section and configured to connect the first end and the flat section in a resilient manner, wherein after closing the molding tool the electrical module is pushed downward such that the bottom side of the electrical module is pushed flatly against the interior surface of the core element in a resilient manner, thereby avoiding damage to the electrical module. In a still further embodiment, the holes which are arranged in the slider element of the molding tool are shaped in a conical manner to provide a guiding function for guiding the second ends of the electrical connectors into the holes when the molding tool is closed. The skilled person will appreciate that except where mutually exclusive, a feature or parameter described in relation to any one of the above aspects may be applied to any other aspect. Furthermore, except where mutually exclusive, any feature or parameter described herein may be applied to any aspect and/or combined with any other feature parameter described herein.\n\nBrief description of the disclosure\n\nThe invention will be explained in more detail on the basis of exemplary embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 is an embodiment of an intermediate structure comprising an electrical module and several electrical connectors; Figure 1a shows the electrical module of Figure 1 in an enlarged view; Figure 2 shows a molding tool comprising a core element and a slider element, wherein the molding tool is in an opened position and wherein a plurality of intermediate structures in accordance with Figure 1 are placed on an interior surface of the core element in a misaligned manner, Figure 3 shows the molding tool of Figure 2 in a closed position, wherein spring- loaded pins located in the slider element of the molding tool push the intermediate structures into position; Figure 4 is an embodiment of an electrical device comprising several electric modules, electrical connectors connected to the electric modules and a mold part embedding the electrical modules; Figure 5 shows the electrical device of Figure 4 attached to a side of a printed circuit board; Figure 6 shows an example press-fit connection for connecting a protruding end of the electrical connector of the electrical device of Figure 4 to a printed circuit board, wherein the protruding end is not yet inserted into a respective plated hole in the printed circuit board; Figure 7 shows the example press-fit connection of Figure 6, wherein the protruding end is inserted into a plated hole in the printed circuit board; and Figure 8 is a flowchart of a method for manufacturing an electrical device.\n\nDetailed description\n\nAspects and embodiments of the present disclosure will now be discussed with reference to the accompanying figures. Further aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Figure 1 shows elements of an electrical device, the elements comprising an electrical module 1 and several electrical connectors 2. The electrical module 1 and the electrical connectors 2 form an intermediate part 6 which is used in a molding tool shown and explained with respect to Figures 2 and 3 for manufacturing an electrical device that is depicted in and explained with respect to Figure 4. The electrical module 1 of Figure 1 is shown in more detail in Figure 1a. The electrical module 1 comprises a semiconductor element 11. In embodiments, the semiconductor element 11 is a power semiconductor element. The electrical module 1 comprises a top side 13 and a bottom side 15. At the top side 13 electrical contacts 12 are arranged which serve to electrically connect the semiconductor element 11. The electrical contacts 12 may be formed as vias each ending in a solder pad on the top side 13. The electrical contacts 12 are depicted schematically only. At the bottom side 15, the electrical module 1 forms a thermal interface 14. The thermal interface 14 may be provided by a metallization layer at the bottom side 15. In the depicted embodiment, thermal vias 17 are provided which thermally (not electrically) couple the semiconductor element 11 to the thermal interface 14. The provision of such vias 17 is optional. The thermal interface 14 is electrically insulated from the semiconductor element 11. To this end, one or several ceramic layers may be included in the electrical module 1 (not shown). The electrical module 1 further comprises an encapsulation 16 which may consist of a molding material or printed circuit board (PCB) material. The electrical module 1 may also be referred to as a prepackaged module. The electrical connectors 2 are electrically connected to the electrical contacts 12 on the top side of the electrical module 1 in order to apply an electric voltage. In an embodiment, the semiconductor element 11 is a power semiconductor element, wherein three electrical connectors 2 are present which provide for a gate voltage, a drain voltage and a source voltage. Figure 1 shows two electrical connectors 2 only. A third electrical connector may be arranged in a plane parallel to the drawing plane, such as behind the left or right electrical connector 2, and is thus not depicted in Figure 1. Further, depending on the number of electrical contacts 12 on the top side of the electrical module 1, more than three or only two electrical connectors 2 may be present. The two electrical connectors 2 that are depicted in Figure 1 are arranged at opposite sides of the electrical module 1, such that the electrical module 1 is arranged symmetrically between the two electrical connectors 2. Generally, in an embodiment, at least two of the electrical connectors 2 may be located at opposite sides of the electrical module 1 to provide for a symmetrical arrangement of the electrical module 1 between the electrical connectors 2. The electrical connectors 2 are formed by stamped and bended sheet metals, which form different sections along their course. Each electrical connector 2 has a first end 21 anda second end 22. At its first end 21, each connector 2 is electrically connected to one of the electrical contacts 12 on the top side 13 of the electrical module 1, such as by soldering or laser welding. For efficient connection, the electrical connectors 2 may be coined at their first ends 21. As shown in Figure 1, by coining the first end 21 the thickness of the electrical connector 2 is reduced in the section forming the first end 21. By reducing the thickness, less heat needs to be applied when soldering or otherwise electrically connecting the first end 21 to the respective electrical contact 12. The second end 22 of the electrical connector 2 runs perpendicular to the first end 21. The second and 22 is adapted for THT connection or press-fit connection to a printed circuit board, as discussed with respect to Figures 5 to 7. Between the first end 21 and the second end 22, each electrical connector 2 forms a springy section 24, a flat section 23 and an intermediate section 25. The springy section 24 is formed by V-shaped section and connects the first end 21 in a resilient manner with the flat section 23. The springy section 24 may be formed in other manners that provide for a resilient connection such as by a curved section. The flat section 23 runs parallel to the first end 21 and perpendicular to the second end 22. It serves to receive a spring-loaded tool during manufacture that pushes the electrical connector 2 and, thereby, the electrical module 1 downwards, as will be discussed with respect to Figures 2 and 3. The intermediate section 25 connects the flat section 23 with the second end 22 and is angled. Figure 2 depicts a molding tool 4 for manufacturing an electrical device in accordance with aspects of the present invention. The molding tool 4 comprises a core element 41 and a slider element 42. The molding tool 4 is configured such that the slider element 42 can be moved towards and away from the core element 41, thereby closing and opening the molding tool 4. In Figure 2, the molding tool 4 is depicted in the opened position. The slider element 42 comprises a plurality of spring-loaded pins 5 which are arranged in respective openings in the slider element 42 and are extending downward towards the core element 41. The slider element 42 further comprises a plurality of openings 43 formed as blind holes, wherein the openings 43 are formed conical at their beginning 430. The core element 41 comprises a flat interior surface 410. Two intermediate structures 6 as depicted in Figure 1 are placed in the opened molding tool 4 and lie on the interior surface 410 of the core element 41. However, at this stage the intermediate structures 6 are misaligned and not in a desired final position. However, they are arranged such on the interior surface 410 that the spring-loaded pins 5 of the slider element 42 are adjacent to the flat sections 23 of the electrical connectors 2. Figure 3 depicts the molding tool 4 of Figure 4 in the closed position, in which the slider element 41 has been moved towards the core element 41. In the closed position, the spring-loaded pins 5 contact the flat sections 23 of the electrical connectors 2. The electrical connectors 2 take up the force that is acting on the electrical connectors 2 by means of the spring-loaded pins 5. As the electrical connectors 2 are connected at their first end 21 to the electrical module 1, the respective force is transmitted to the electrical module 1, thereby pushing the electrical module 1 downwards such that the bottom side 15 (Figure 1a) of the electrical module 1 is pushed flatly against the interior surface 410 of the core element 41. The force absorbed by the flat section 23 is transmitted in a resilient manner via the springy section 24 to the electrical module 1. This way, the bottom sides 15 and thermal interfaces 14 of all electrical modules 1 that are arranged in the molding tool 4 are placed at the same level or plane. Further, the second ends 22 of the electrical connectors 2 are moved into the holes 43 of the slider element 42 when the molding tool 4 is closed, wherein the conical part 430 of the holes 43 guides the second ends 22 in a reliable manner into the holes 43. After the molding tool 4 is closed, the interior forms a cavity 44 which is filled with a casting compound which is injected through openings and channels not depicted in the Figures. By injecting the casting compound, the intermediate structures 6 are overmolded, however, without the casting compound covering the thermal interface 14 at the bottom side 15 of the electrical modules 1 as the bottom side/thermal interface lies flatly against the interior surface 410 and, accordingly, cannot be covered by the casting compound. The casting compound is then cured, thereby forming a mold part as will be explained with respect to Figure 4. The molding tool 4 is opened and the electrical device removed. The casting compound which, when cured, forms the mold part 3 may be a thermally conductive plastic material having a thermal conductivity which lies in the range from 1 WimK to 100 W/mK. Thereby, heat emanating from the electrical connectors 2 and/or heat emanating from the connection of the electrical connectors 2 to the electrical contacts 12 of the electrical module 1 (Figure 1) can be transferred to the thermal interface 14 for dissipating into a heat sink. The casting compound may also be of a plastic material which has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, in particular a coefficient of thermal expansion lower than that of aluminum. The molding process in molding tool 4 may be a resin transfer molding process or other molding process. Figure 4 shows the manufactured electrical device 100 which comprises several electrical modules 1, the corresponding electrical connectors 2 and a mold part 3 which embeds the electrical modules 1 and the electrical connectors 2. The mold part 3 has a top side 31 and a bottom side 32. The second ends 22 of the electrical connectors 2 stick out of the mold part top side 31. They comprise a conical sleeve 34 which corresponds to the conical part 430 of the holes 43 in the slider element 42. The provision of a conical sleeve 34 is optional. Due to the method of manufacture discussed with respect to Figures 2 and 3, the electrical modules 1 are arranged such in the mold part 3 that the respective thermal interfaces 14 of the electrical modules 1 flushes with the bottom side 32 of the mold part 3, without the thermal interface 14 being covered by material of the mold part 3. At the same time, the thermal interfaces 14 of all electrical modules 1 of the electrical device 100 are arranged in the same plane without tilting with respect to each other. This allows to effectively thermally couple the electrical modules 1 and thermal interfaces 14 with a heat sink (not shown). In an embodiment, the thermal interfaces 14 of the electrical modules 1 do not flush with the bottom side 32 of the mold part 3 but each protrude from the bottom side 32 of the mold part 3, while still all thermal interfaces 14 of all electrical modules 1 are arranged in the same plane without tilting with respect to each other. In such case, e.g., the electrical modules 21 are arranged in small recesses in the interior surface 410 of the core element 41 during the molding process. It is pointed out that the mold part 3 comprises openings 35 at areas in which the spring- loaded pins 5 were present when injecting the casting compound into the molding tool 4. It is further pointed out that the mold part 3 may comprise further features such as feature 36 that may be beneficial for aligning or attaching the mold part 3 and electrical device 100 to another element such as a printed circuit board. Generally, any desired geometry of the mold part 3 can be easily provided for by constructing the molding tool 4 and its cavity 44 accordingly. Figure 5 depicts the electrical device 100 of Figure 4 as connected to the bottom side of a printed circuit board 7, wherein the second ends 22 of the electrical connectors 2 are electrically connected to respective contact areas of the printed circuit board 7. For example, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, the second ends 22 are connected to the printed circuit board 7 by means of a press-fit connection, wherein the inner diameter of the second end 22 is larger than the diameter of a plated hole 71 in the printed circuit board 7. When pressing the second end 22 into the plated hole 71, the second end 22 plastically deforms, thereby ensuring a gas-tight contact with low-resistance. Alternatively, the second ends 22 are connected to the printed circuit board 7 by THT connections. Figure 8 summarizes main steps for manufacturing an electrical device 100 as shown in Figure 4. In step 81, at least one intermediate structure is provided that comprises an electrical module and electrical connectors connected to the electrical module. An embodiment of such intermediate structure is depicted in Figure 1. In step 82, one or several such intermediate structures are placed in an opened molding tool, wherein the molding tool comprises a core element and a slider element. A plurality of spring-loaded tools are arranged in the slider element and extend towards the core element. The slider element also comprises a plurality of holes. Next, in step 83, the molding tool is closed. The molding tool is closed by the slider element moving towards the core element. Thereby, the spring-loaded pins of the slider element contact the intermediate structure, thereby pushing the intermediate structure including the electrical module downwards such that the bottom side of the electrical module is pushed flatly against the interior surface of the core element. Also, the second ends of the electrical connectors extend into the holes in the slider element when the molding tool is closed. In step 84, a casting compound is injected into the molding tool. Thereby, the at least one intermediate structure is overmolded by the casting compound. However, the casting compound does not cover the thermal interface of the electrical module. Next, in step 85, the casting compound is cured, thereby forming a mold part which embeds the at least one electrical module and the electrical connectors. The mold part, the at least one electrical module and the electrical connectors form an electrical device. In step 86, the molding tool is opened and the electrical device is removed from the molding tool. Subsequently, the electrical device may be electrically connected to a PCB and thermally coupled to a heat sink.
