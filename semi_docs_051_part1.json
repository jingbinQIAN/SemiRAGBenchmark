Appendix 3 contains a general equation that can be used when this is not the case.  \n8.2  Compare the Equivalent Release Concentration to the hazardous process gas TLV or PEL, whichever is lower.  If the ERC is above the prescribed limits, the enclosure is not considered to be acceptable; if the ERC is less than or equal to the prescribed limit, the enclosure is considered acceptable. SEMI S2 recommends appropriate control limits for an enclosure.\n\nSEMI F15-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR ENCLOSURES USING SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE TRACER GAS AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY - # 9  Reporting Results\n\n9.1  Present all results in tabular form in a manner which unambiguously notes those enclosure(s) that do not satisfy the criteria of SEMI S2.  The exhaust operating conditions during each test must be provided along with each measured ERC value.  \n9.2  Describe tracer gas injection points within individual enclosures to detail location and proximity to openings, penetrations, exhaust grillwork, access panels, and other potential leakage sites, such that worst case leak conditions have been simulated.  \n9.3  Describe the unit being tested by manufacturer, model number, and serial number to provide identification of the unit being tested.  \n9.4  Tabulate and record the name, supply concentration, maximum flow rate, and TLV or PEL for each hazardous gas or vapor used within each enclosure being tested.\n\nSEMI F15-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR ENCLOSURES USING SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE TRACER GAS AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY - # 10  Related Documents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F15-93 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR ENCLOSURES USING SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE TRACER GAS AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY - # 10  Related Documents\n\nContent: 29 CFR 1910.1000 ⎯ Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

The safety factor is intended to make allowance for manufacturing and testing variables such as normal variations in the material, manufacturing process, dimensions, and in the evaluation procedures (ASTM D 2837 and D 1598). 6.2 Application conditions also ne ed to be taken into consideration and may require an increased safety factor. For example, with liquid hydrocarbons and other chemicals, temperature can have a disproportional effect on the long-term performance of the tubing or pipe. No general safety factor has been established for these types of services, so each case should be designed on its own merit.

The composition of 316L specified in Table I of ASTM A 182/A 182M, ASTM A 240, ASTM A 269, ASTM A 276, ASTM A 479/A 479M, or ASTM A 632, has a maximum of 0.030 percent Sulfur; however several properties affecting the manufacture and applications of 316L can vary significantly over this range of Sulfur content. Therefore a lower Sulfur maximum is specified in SEMI F20, as listed in $\\ P [ 6 . 3 . 2$ and Table 1 of ${ \\ P } 6 . 3 . 3$ . A1-2.2 Sulfur has a very low solubility in austenitic stainless steels, thus in these alloys it exists as discrete inclusions of Manganese Sulfide, with some solubility for Chromium as well as other trace elements. These inclusions can initiate pits and other defects on electropolished surfaces,\n\nSEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A1-2 Effects of Sulfur (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A1-2 Effects of Sulfur\n\nContent: increasing in number with increasing Sulfur content. A1-2.3 The Manganese Sulfide inclusions improve the machinability of stainless steel; compositions intended for machining have Sulfur compositions near the 0.030 percent maximum, whereas stainless steels with very low Sulfur levels require lower feeds and speeds and will cause reduced tool life during machining. A1-2.4 Sulfur also strongly affects welding of stainless steel; variation of Sulfur from very low contents to the maximum permitted can increase weld bead penetration by approximately a factor of two for similar weld parameters. A1-2.5 The effects of Sulfur are summarized in Table A1-1.\n\nSEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A1-2 Welding Effects of Sulfur\n\nA1-2.1  Two effects are observed on welding with variations in Sulfur level:  \nA1-2.1.1  As Sulfur is reduced the heat input required for full penetration increases.  \nA1-2.1.2  As Sulfur is reduced below approximately 0.005 percent there is a marked change in weld pool dynamics, causing the weld pool to become wider and shallower .\n\nSEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # Table A1-1 – Effects of Sulfur on Austenitic Stainless Steels (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # Table A1-1 – Effects of Sulfur on Austenitic Stainless Steels\n\nContent: A1-2.1.3 The latter effect is due to a reversal of the convection currents in the weld pool at approximately 0.005 percent Sulfur. At Sulfur levels significantly above 0.005 percent the convective currents flow downward from the arc, causing deep penetration as illustrated in Figure A1-1, whereas at Sulfur levels well below about 0.005 percent the convective currents flow outward from the arc, causing a wider weld pool and shallower penetration as illustrated in Figure A1- $\\cdot 2 ^ { 3 }$ .

The weld pool can become asymmetric, favoring the low Sulfur side, and cause the root of the weld to shift away from the joint, as illustrated in Figure A1-3. Figure A1-3 he Weld Pool is Asymmetric When Welding Stainless Steel Pieces with Significantly Different Sulfur Levels A1-2.1.5 In order to minimize this effect it is desirable to match Sulfur contents in components to be welded to within $\\pm { \\ : 0 . 0 0 7 }$ percentage points.

It is not an intentional addition, but is present in any heat of material as a result of the composition of the furnace charge materials used, which are typically primarily scrap with elemental and master alloy additions to achieve the composition desired. Levels of unspecified elements such as Copper are permitted up to $0 . 5 0 \\%$ maximum by AMS $\\dot { 2 } 2 4 8 \\mathrm { E } ^ { 4 }$ .  Copper content can only be reduced in the melt by dilution. Over time, as more scrap material is recycled, the residual levels of copper in heats of AISI 316L is anticipated to increase.  \nA2-1.2  Copper is an austenite phase stabilizer.  It also has been shown to improve the resistance of austenitic stainless steels to stress corrosion cracking in chloride solutions.\n\nSEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A2-2 Effects of Copper on Welding (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F20-0305 SPECIFICATION FOR 316L STAINLESS STEEL BAR, FORGINGS, EXTRUDED SHAPES, PLATE, AND TUBING FOR COMPONENTS USED IN GENERAL PURPOSE, HIGH PURITY AND ULTRA-HIGH PURITY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A2-2 Effects of Copper on Welding\n\nContent: A2-2.1 In welding, copper is a surface-active element (like S, O, and Se) and has been shown to contribute significantly to weld bead meander. Like manganese, it will volatilize during welding and redeposit downstream of the weld, providing a site for the initiation of corrosion in some conditions. Some end users may restrict copper as a potential source of weld contamination or corrosion. A2-2.2 A correlation was noted between increased copper content and weld bead meander in a wafer fab project5. Five heats of 0.25 in. tubing were evaluated. Copper was very prominent in the HAZ of one heat $0 . 4 7 \\%$ Cu and $0 . 0 1 1 \\% \\mathrm { S }$ ) which had a bead meander problem when welded.

All welds were performed in argon. A2-2.3 In a study of 28 heats of tubing from 0.25 to 2.0 inch in diameter, copper ranged from 0.05 to $0 . 4 1 \\% ^ { 6 }$ . Of the 28 heats tested, 10 had copper contents above $0 . 2 5 \\%$ , and among the nine heats of 2.0 in. diameter tubing, all had copper levels above $0 . 2 2 \\%$ , with four of the heats above $0 . 2 5 \\%$ . Cosmetically unacceptable welds (slag, discoloration and/or bead meander) occurred on heats with: $0 . 2 6 \\%$ Cu, $0 . 0 0 5 \\%$ S; $0 . 2 8 \\%$ Cu, $0 . 0 0 9 \\%$ S; and $0 . 4 1 \\%$ Cu, $0 . 0 0 5 \\%$ S. Conversely, cosmetically acceptable welds were performed on a heat with $0 . 3 \\%$ Cu and $0 . 0 1 1 \\%$ S. All welds were performed using argon.

Two examples of heats of AISI 316L tubing, 2.5 in. in diameter, with copper contents above $0 . 3 \\%$ , demonstrated that adding hydrogen to the argon shield gas adversely affected the weldability of the tubing (see Figure A2-1). This same effect was not noted in heats of tubing with copper levels below $0 . 3 \\%$ . In addition, the weld electrodes undergo severe degradation when welding tubing with copper contents above $0 . 3 \\%$ and using $\\mathrm { A r / H } _ { 2 }$ shield gas (see Figure A2-2). A2-2.5 Based on the above information, the following conclusions can be made: A2-2.5.1 The copper restriction in SEMI F20 currently stands at $0 . 3 0 \\%$ . This restriction is due to weldability effects.

The specialty gas system should be connected through a sample valve directly to the particle counter, a pressure gauge, and a flow control device (FCD). When sampling is performed using wall tap sample ports, the aspiration efficiency should be checked using the method described in Related Information 1. The sampling system should contain minimum dead volume and sample tube length. All components in the sampling system should be leak tight and cleaned in accordance with good engineering practice. A leak check of the system should be performed in accordance with normally accepted practice. The FCD may be part of the particle counter. The particle counter should be maintained at the pressure of the gas system. The FCD can be a metering valve and a flow meter or a critical orifice.

NOTE 4: The alternative sampling configurations described in SEMI C6.3 can also be used for hydrogen. 7.4 Using the high purity nitrogen system shown in Figure 1, purge the sampling system and particle counter for at least 5 minutes at the instrument manufacturer’s specified flow rate. The exact purge time should take into account the reactivity of the gas and should be sufficient to purge the entire exhaust line. An oxygen sensor should be placed at the system exhaust to verify less than 1 ppmv oxygen in the purge nitrogen. The purging must be performed before flammable gas is introduced into the sampling system and after completion of the measurement. The valve leading to the oxygen sensor should be closed when flammable gas is being sampled.

NOTE 5: It is known that flammable gases can react with oxygen present in the sampling system. Nitrogen purging of the sampling system reduces the risk of reaction. The purity of the purge nitrogen should be sufficient to remove reactive substances from the sampling system. 7.5 Count the particles in each of at least 3 equal intervals. Each sample interval must be at least 25 standard liters (0.95 SCF), or 30 minutes, whichever is greater. Data obtained during the first 5 minutes after the sample valve is opened may be discarded. Record the number of counts in the sample volume for each interval. Calculate $\\overline { { \\mathrm { X } } } _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ and $\\mathrm { \\sf S _ { C } }$ , as defined in Section 4.

Additional deviation from isokinesis can result from stream tube contraction or expansion when the velocities $\\mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ and v are not equal. The effects of non-isokinetic flow on the measurement should be checked. The particle sampling process should be performed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.
