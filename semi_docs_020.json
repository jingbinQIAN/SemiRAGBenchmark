These objects may optionally be contained (singly or in mass) within a carrier. Empty carriers may also be considered objects. Material movement may include several different types of entities. These are divided into two classes: Host and Equipment. The host is the supervising entity which organizes the transfer and gives the appropriated instructions to each equipment involved. An equipment physically participates in the transfer, either sending or receiving material. The class of equipment may be divided into three types: Process Equipment — Equipment which performs value-added operations on the factories’ products. This includes those equipment which physically changes the product and those which measure/test the product. Transfer Agent — A type of equipment specialized to the movement of transfer objects from place to place within a factory. Transfer agents themselves may"

These may be fixed-arm robots, robot arms on a fixed track, AGVs with or without robot arms, overhead gantries, cars on tracks, or even transfer systems containing a heterogenous collection of other transfer agents. Humans also may act as transfer agents. Storage Areas — A type of equipment used to hold transfer objects pending further processing (if product) or use (if reticles, etc.) within the factory. A storage area may be as sophisticated as an automated WIP Bin or as simple as a shelf. 3.1 Macro and Micro Levels — M aterial movement is separated into two levels. The more abstract level, called the macro level, consists of all message transactions used by the host in its coordination role. At the macro level, the host is responsible for determining what material is to be moved, from where, to where, and when. The host shall provide each party involved in a transfer job with the information necessary to perform its part of that transfer job. A transfer job may be"

The communications between the transfer partners is called the micro level of material movement. These communications occur between the two partners in a “peer-to-peer” fashion. Micro communications may be implemented via a direct equipment-to-equipment connection or by passing messages indirectly through the host. The macro and micro levels are designed to work together so that the host may initiate the transfer and then allow the transfer partners to perform the job interactively. However, these two levels may be used separately. For instance, the macro level may be combined with functionality of the SEMI E23 (Cassette Transfer Parallel I/O Interface Specification) standard.

Here, the micro level may still be used to accomplish the transfer. The controlling partner would perform the coordination functions normally in the domain of the host. In this standard, the macro and micro levels are defined separately, each with its concepts, behavior, and services. 3.2 Ports and Locations — A port may be considered a point of entry to the equipment. A location is a receptacle for a transfer object. At any time, a port shall be linked to at least one location. However, some locations may be internal and never be linked to a port. For “typical” factory equipment, there is a permanent one-to-one correspondence between the port and a location. However, not all semiconductor equipment follows this pattern. For instance, the port on a transfer agent that includes a robot arm and multiple on-board storage locations is actually the gripper on the robot arm. The gripper is also a location. In another case, a port may actually feed a rotating carousel containing multiple locations."

The location linked to this type of port would be the one in front of the door at transfer time and would change whenever the carousel rotates. Figure 3.1 helps to illustrate the difference between ports and locations. It is important to note that the attribute of “full” or “empty” belongs to a location rather than a port. A port that has just received a transfer object may be able to receive another immediately. Likewise, a port that has sent a transfer object may have more material available to send. 3.3 Compliance — Compliance to this standard includes adherance to all stated requirements in this document. This includes all defined messages services, state models, and communications scenarios. This standard may be divided into two parts: Material Movement Macro Level, and Material Movement Micro Level. An equipment may be compliant to one of these parts without the other. Details of compliance to each of these parts are defined in the body of this document."

Secondary Transfer Partner — The opposite of the primary transfer partner. This partner is either passive during the transfer or is controlled by the primary transfer partner.

This is the fundamental building block of material movement. An atomic transfer includes the minimum number of physical participants in the move: one sender and one receiver. Thus, only one change of ownership shall occur in an atomic transfer. All transfers required in practice can be constructed as a series of atomic transfers. A set of atomic transfers combined to make a complex but cohesive transfer is called a compound transfer. 4.1.3 Compound Transfer — On the factory floor, many material transfer situations will require multiple atomic transfers. For example, the host may determine that a material carrier needs to be moved from equipment “X” to equipment “Y” by transfer agent “T.” To accomplish the transfer would require two atomic transfers, first “T” acquires the carrier from “X,” then it delivers it to “Y.” A compound transfer might involve"

These parallel transfers may be with the same transfer partner, or with multiple partners. There are no inherent restrictions to a transfer job simultaneously executing multiple atomic transfers on an equipment. If an equipment's ports are static (i.e., always passive), the equipment should allow parallel transfers. If the ports are dynamic, there may be some sharing of resources which could limit this (e.g., use of the same robot arm).

For instance, it may be possible to “teach” one transfer partner the proprietary commands that the other partner understands by embedding those commands in a transfer recipe.

A transfer system, which might include several material transport devices, can be described the same way. However, there are some important differences. There are a number of ways that a host could view a transport system, including: as a single transfer agent with numerous ports, as a single transfer agent with a single port and numerous internal locations, as multiple logical transfer agents with their own ports, or as the set of real transfer agents that the transfer system controls. The transfer system may conceal from the host the various internal operations (e.g., handoffs, travel paths) that it uses to complete a transfer. It may even hide the actual physical location (or series of locations) and provide a logical location for host reference. 4.1.7 Transfer Job — The host's ma terial transfer objectives are"

A typical compound transfer may also be accomplished by creating a separate transfer job for each required atomic transfer. The decision to group atomic transfers into a transfer job is applicationdependent. The key advantages to the use of compound transfer jobs are the reduction of the communication overhead to the host and the streamlining of the transfer process. The communication overhead is reduced by the fact that the host can define a number of atomic transfer operations with a single message to the equipment. The equipment are not required to wait for host commands between these atomic transfers. The process is streamlined by virtue of the removal of redundant physical activities during the transfer job.

One example of streamlining would be the “exchange” of carriers between equipment, where a transfer agent might bring an empty carrier to replace a full carrier on the “output port” of a machine. If the port has a door that is opened during transfer preparation and closed during the restore phase, the door would be better left open for both atomic transfers. Upon completion of the removal of the first transfer object, rather than close the door, the new transfer is begun and the door left open. The two atomic transfers would thus be executed as one smooth “swap” transfer without wasted time. Equipment View of Transfer Job — A transfer job may involve a number of equipment and ports. Each of the involved equipment is given a Transfer Job Create request that specifies only the portion of the overall transfer job that involves that equipment.

When a transfer job references multiple ports on the equipment, these ports may execute their atomic job sequences in parallel to the other ports. See Figure 4.1 for an illustration of the flow of a complex transfer job from the view of one equipment. The three parallel paths show a possible chronology for a transfer job. There are exceptions to the sequencing guidelines above. One case would be a device designed to simultaneously transfer from multiple ports on one machine to corresponding ports on another. This would translate into synchronized parallel atomic transfers on separate ports."

Queued transfer jobs and parallel transfer jobs are separate concepts, either of which may be supported.

If parallel transfer jobs are supported and the necessary locations are available, a second (or third, etc.) transfer job may begin execution. In some cases a port may provide direct access to multiple locations. This may be true for the specialized ports described in Section 3.2 and in cases where the port serves as a pass–through to internal locations.

Resume — The resume command is used to continue a previously paused transfer activity. Stop — The host may command the involved partners to stop a transfer job. The stop command terminates a job in an orderly manner. The object of the stop command is to complete currently executing atomic transfers and leave the equipment and material in a safe state.

This is normally associated with physical activity within the transfer envelope. 5.1.2 Micro Level Description — W hile the macro level of material movement deals with coordination and preparation for a transfer, the micro level addresses the physical synchronization between two transfer partners during an atomic transfer. To control these physical interactions properly, communication between the transfer partners is required.

The first part is the exchange of “I'm ready” type messages, so that the partners can be sure that starting the transfer is appropriate. 2. The second part of the micro level interaction is the coordination of the physical transfer. During a transfer, control of the transfer envelope may belong to only one partner at any time. Joint or parallel movement is never allowed in this space13. The transfer itself is a series of steps called micro moves. Each step typically contains all the activities one partner can perform before the other must act. If the secondary partner is passive during the move, no micro level communications are needed for part two, since the primary partner shall control the transfer envelope during the entire physical transfer. 3.

AGVs are used in the examples below because they are familiar to most readers, not because they are favored over other transfer agents. To simplify the explanation, the examples below deal only with movement of cassettes. A1-4.1 Passive Transfer — In this example, a transfer is to be performed between an AGV with robot arm and a piece of processing equipment. A cassette is to be picked up by the AGV for later delivery to another piece of equipment. The equipment has a cassette indexer and a port door, but no other port-related mechanism that would either aid or hinder transfer. The chosen transfer mechanism provides for the equipment to act as a passive transfer partner with no micro level communications required. This is called a passive transfer. The primary transfer"

The setup operations for the AGV are to ensure that its receiving port is empty and to drive to the transfer position in front of the designated equipment. The transfer proceeds in the following steps: 1. The host sends a Transfer Job Create message to each transfer partner. 2. The partners each accept the transfer job. 3.

To accomplish the transfer, two atomic moves are required. First, the robot picks up the cassette at “A.” Second, the robot deposits the cassette on “B.” The gripper on the robot is considered its port in this case, since that is the point at which ownership of the cassette changes.

Meaningful events would be reported to the host as appropriate. An alternative would be to design the system such that the track system tells the stepper system, in effect, “I'll be sending a series of wafers to you.” Since the HOReady message contains sufficient information to describe the transfer (assuming a specific transfer recipe is not required), no specifics about the individual transfers need be exchanged until the HOReady is sent.

That is, it is not clear which partner should be the “SECS-I host” and which the “SECS-I equipment.” As a general rule, if one partner is always the primary transfer partner, it should be configured as the SECS-I host. However, this is not a requirement, since in some cases the choice of which is the primary partner may depend upon the situation. Therefore, where SECS-I is used to link the transfer partners, each partner should be user-configurable as either “host” or “equipment.” NOTICE: These standards do not purport to addresxs safety issues, if any, assosciated with their use.

There is no requirement that all internal work in the application be performed in the markup described by Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Information Tagging, only that the end product, exported for interchange, must be a conforming document. 4.3 Conforming Document - A conforming document is one that meets the markup rules and specific information models defined in Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Information Tagging for the class of document. This specification comprises three parts: this base document, a set of information models, and the documentation for those models. A conforming document must"

For example, a rendering engine may not require an element which is optional in the models or require an attribute that is implied. A rendering application may require that the rules in this Base Specification and those in the Tag Library are followed. For example, if the DTDs say that an element is optional, a Rendering Application may not require that it be present. If the Tag Library says that the contents of an element must be some particular information, the Rendering Application may require that it be so. More specifically, if the <description> element is optional, a Rendering Application may not fail to process a document because it does not"

A document is made up of one or more elements which must all be contained in one “root” element. 4.7 Document Class - A document class consists of all of the documents or information fragments that follow a single set of markup rules, including the same elements and element relationships. In general, a class of documents can be considered to be documents that are nearly the same in structure and have similar types of content. A document class is usually (but not necessarily) defined by a structural model (such as a DTD or Schema) that governs its existence. 4.8 Document Exchange - For SEMI E36, “document exchange” is synonymous with “document interchange” (see"

DTDs and Schema are types of document models. 4.11 Document Type Definition (DTD) - A DTD is a document model or list of markup rules, which may be used in both SGML and XML. As specified in the SGML standard, ISO 8879, a DTD is: “Rules, determined by an application, that apply SGML to the markup of documents of a particular type. A document type definition includes a formal specification, expressed in a document type declaration, of the element types, element relationships and attributes and references that can be represented by markup. It thereby defines the vocabulary of the markup for which SGML defines the syntax.” (ISO 8879 4.105) 4.12 Element - An element is"

In the previous version of this specification (i.e., in SEMI E36-95) an element is also referred to as an “information component.” An element is: A uniquely addressable unit of information within the document; and/or An identifier to an addressable unit of information outside the document. 4.13 Markup - For Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Information Tagging, markup is defined as additional data characters that are added to data to provide information about the data and make the data more useable.

The ISO Reference Number is ISO 8879:1986(E). SGML is a metalanguage for constructing markup. See also XML (Extensible Markup Language). 4.16 Tag - A tag is a string of characters delimited by rules set out in the SGML standard (and used in XML and HTML). Tags are placed in the datastream to indicate where an element begins and ends. In Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Information Tagging, tags match as closely as possible the names of the elements in English. 4.17 XLL (Extensible Linking Language) - When released, XLL is intended to be the syntax and semantics for both simple hypertext linking (as exemplified by HTML) and more complex linking, providing such functionality as"

Applications will be able to utilize this markup to: Select, limit, and organize specific elements for reuse or interchange; Start and stop behavior, such as print formatting, complex screen display, and the actuation of programs; Limit retrieval (for increased precision); Generate navigation aids such as indexes and tables of contents; and Validate document structure or content. 5.2 SGML Standard and XML Family of Recommendations - The intent of Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing Information Tagging is to define the rules and markup that can be"

There are situations in which each of the following element types are appropriate, and many situations in which several could be used. In designing structures and tagging documents, elements should be designed using the following hierarchy of types, from most- to leastpreferred. Only if the information cannot be satisfactorily identified using one type of element should those below it in the following list be considered. Content Elements — those that identify the information content, such as Warning, Procedural Step, Part Number, Installation Manual, or Bill of Materials. Structural Elements — those that identify the structural role of a part of a document, such as Title, Paragraph, or List Item. Pointer Elements — those that point to other locations, either in this document or another, such as Cross-reference, Footnote Reference, or URL. Format Elements — those that identify portions of a document that are to be"

Format elements are to be used as a last resort; use of a content, structure, or pointer element with a format-related attribute is preferable to use of a format element. 5.5.2 Naming Elements - Markup in the DTDs will be named consistently across contexts. That is, the same element name will be used for an element that can occur in many places with the same function, regardless of the location. For example, there is only one element for Title, not many separate elements for Section Title, Table Title, Figure Title, etc. In XML, names are case-sensitive. In the interest of keeping compliant with XML, all names will be case sensitive. (In SGML, names may not be case-sensitive since such names may be case-folded to upper case at any time.) All element tag names should be in lower case. Entity names and attribute names may be mixed"

If there is no such consideration, lower case should be used. Attribute values should be in lower case unless there is a good reason to make them another case, such as a list of state or country codes which would naturally appear in upper case. 5.5.3 Recursive Structures - In cases where an element may contain one or more of the same elements within itself, there are several styles of modeling the solution: Use recursive structures. (In recursion, an element would be allowed to contain itself, thus a <section> could contain one or more <section>s, which could themselves contain <section ${ > } s$ , etc.); Create an explicit hierarchy by naming the top level and lower levels. (Thus a <section> could contain one or more <subsections>, which could themselves contain one or more <sub-subsections>, etc.); or Create an explicit hierarchy by numbering the top level as “1”, and subsequent levels as “2”, “3”, etc. (Thus a <section1>"

In such cases, recursion should be used to model an element because it is optimal for authoring, editing, and data reuse; in such an environment an editor can move a section from one level to another without needing to modify the tagging inside the section. 5.5.4 Content Modeling - To create SGML elements that are maximally re-useable and compatible with XML, there are several SGML modeling capabilities that are prohibited in SEMI E36: RCDATA and CDATA declared content (character data in which elements and entities cannot be recognized) are prohibited. The “AND” connector (which specifies that all the elements so connected are required but that order is irrelevant) is prohibited. Inclusions and Exclusions to content models are prohibited.

Attribute values must not contain references to external entities.

Only the following Default Values keywords may be used: #REQUIRED (must be present); #IMPLIED (optional, may be implied by the application); and #FIXED (set, not able to be changed). 5.6 Formatting from Element Context versus from Attributes - The use of formatting attributes to indicate preferred rendition in display or print should be limited to situations in which no other mechanism is available. That is, if the desired formatting can be accomplished by use of the element name alone, or based on the context in which the element appears, no formatting attributes should be used. Elements should only carry formatting attributes such as “type-size” if there is no other mechanism to pass this information or if an author"

    "content": "2.1  The specification contains two levels of compliance necessary in implementing the electronic documentation standard. The following two components make up the compliance levels.  \n2.1.1  Level One Identity — Allows for content to be uniquely identified, most notably the Item ID and Edition ID attributes.  \n2.1.2  Level Two Type and Metadata — Association of semantic detail with items.  Important information about the item that allows us to interpret the item correctly.  Compliance is established for this level by ensuring that the item uses a standard tag name and is equipped with a small standard set of metadata properties as defined by the specification.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use."
