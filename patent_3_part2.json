As shown in Fig. 4. And under the excitation of signals with different frequencies, the I-V hysteresis loop of the device will change with the signal frequency. When the frequency increases, the side lobe area of the hysteresis loop decreases. When the frequency increases to infinity, the hysteresis loop of the device degenerates into a single-valued function. In addition, the memristor device is designed based on the structure of silicon controlled rectifier, because the silicon controlled rectifier itself has strong anti-electromagnetic interference ability and has always been a good robustness as an electrostatic protection device. Therefore, compared with other memristors made of different materials, the negative resistance clamped silicon controlled rectifier memristor devices are completely compatible with standard microelectronic processes and can realize large-scale on-chip integration. The stability of memristors made of silicon controlled rectifier is obviously better than other types of memristors.

The formation of thyristor structure produces negative resistance effect, which makes the device clamp to a lower value after the voltage and current overshoot, and the voltage and current lag in the same time, thus realizing the continuous regulation of the device resistance. Under the excitation of periodic pulse signal, the excitation signal is a square wave with a rising edge of 10 ns, a falling edge of 10 ns and a pulse width of 100 ns. When the negative pulse signal comes to the anode of the device and the cathode of the device is grounded, the fourth N+ implantation region 111, the second P-Well region 1032 and the N-Well region 104 constitute the NPN; triode.

When the positive periodic pulse excitation signal comes to the anode of the device and the cathode is grounded, the trigger surface of the device consists of the first P-Well region 1031 and the N-Well region 104. When the signal causes avalanche breakdown of the device, the avalanche voltage is determined by the distance between the first P-Well region 1031 and the N-Well region 104. After the avalanche breakdown of the device, the negative resistance effect occurs, and the current and voltage at both ends of the device are clamped to a lower value after overshoot, and the phenomenon of hysteresis occurs, so that the flexible regulation of the device resistance under the forward pulse with fixed amplitude and frequency can be realized. When the negative periodic pulse excitation signal comes to the anode and cathode of the device, the trigger surface of the device is composed of the second P-Well region 1032 and the N-Well region 104. When the signal causes avalanche breakdown of the device, the avalanche voltage is determined by the distance between the second P-Well region 1032 and the N-Well region 104. After the avalanche breakdown of the device, the negative resistance effect occurs, and the current and voltage at both ends of the device are clamped to a lower value after overshoot, and the phenomenon of hysteresis occurs, so that the flexible regulation of the device resistance under the negative pulse with fixed amplitude and frequency can be realized. The device meets the three criteria of memristor under external bias, that is, under the excitation of bipolar periodic signal, the I-V curve of the device presents hysteresis loop. When the frequency of excitation signal increases, the side lobe area of Based on all the above contents, the invention provides a manufacturing method for rectifying memristor device structure of coating furnace, which is simple in process and convenient to operate.
