Surface water supplies are often mixed by the local municipal services, and seasonal variations are also introduced as ground water and well waters are brought in and out of service.  Consequently, periodic analysis of metals in incoming feedwater and at key points of the UPW system including after the final filter is essential so that significant changes in performance may be corrected early in the process of deionization.\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 8.9.3  Boron\n\n8.9.3.1  Boron is a trace element that, like silica, is weakly attracted to anion resins.  Both elements serve as a flag for the onset of ionic breakthrough through the anion exchange resin.  A rapid and systematic rise in the boron content immediately after the resin bed is typical when ion-exchange resins approach exhaustion in the UPW system. Silica and boron breakthough rates and each element’s selectivity in the ion exchange process is a matter of ongoing study. The safest route is to measure both, but at least to focus on the one most prevalent in the city water feed stream.\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 8.9.4  Contaminants from the Distribution System\n\n8.9.4.1  Certain heavy elements such as Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Cr, and $\\mathrm { P b }$ may be present as trace impurities in plastic  \n(PFA and PVDF) components and are continuously leached into the UPW streams.  Plastic lined metal components such as pumps, storage tanks, and other UPW processing vessels may develop pinholes, thereby leaching out heavy metal impurities into the UPW system.\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 8.9.5  Contaminants from Feed Water\n\n8.9.5.1  The alkali metals (Na, K), alkali earths $( { \\mathrm { M g } } .$ , Ca) and Fe comprise the bulk elements of most natural waters, and play a significant role in bulk water chemistry including hardness, alkalinity and total dissolved solids.  Of these elements, sodium is the most abundant and is present in final filter UPW at sub-ppb level.  Highly charged metals (Al, Fe, and Mn) have the potential to coagulate and foul RO membranes, and Ba and Sr can cause scaling of the RO and ion exchange resins.\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 8.9.6  Priority Metals in Semiconductor Processing\n\n8.9.6.1  Certain processing steps expose a wafer to contamination from UPW in a unique way.   Metals from incoming materials (e.g., chemicals, wafers, etc.), deteriorating wafer processing equipment, and new processes and materials for deposited circuit layers can lead to cross contamination and high concentrations of metals  “gettering” on the silicon wafer surface. Testing for metals in the UPW at POU (e.g., the rinse bath) may be important in identifying and preventing sources of metal contamination on the wafer.  Certain other elements, calcium, magnesium and aluminum, have an increased ability to contaminate the oxides of wafers. There may be other metals that, depending on the semiconductor process, can also act as harmful contaminants.\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 8.9.7  Radioactive Elements\n\n8.9.7.1  Radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium can cause soft X-ray damage to devices when present at ppt levels. These elements are detectable in a full ICP-MS scan.\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 9.1  On-Line Monitoring (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 9.1  On-Line Monitoring\n\nContent: 9.1.1 On-line monitors for UPW are readily available from a variety of manufacturers. Before selecting an instrument for on-line monitoring an evaluation should be made about 1.) sensitivity of measurements, 2.) accuracy of the measurements, 3.) reproducibility of the measurements, 4.) calibration protocols for the instrument, 5.) zero count for the instrument (particle counters) and 6.) instrument cost and reliability. 9.1.2 If on-line monitors are not available at critical sampling points, or the sensitivity of the on-line monitor is not sufficient to accurately measure at the required levels, grab samples may be taken and sent to a qualified laboratory for equivalent testing. This offline sampling and testing requires special apparatus and trained personnel. A clear understanding of the limits of each method is required before its application. 9.1.3 All on-line monitoring requires clean and tight sample port connections in order to eliminate false counts. 9.2 Testing at critical sampling\n\nSEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 9.1  On-Line Monitoring (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F75-1102 GUIDE FOR QUALITY MONITORING OF ULTRAPURE WATER USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING - # 9.1  On-Line Monitoring\n\nContent: points, such as pointof-use, requires special sampling apparatus and trained personnel. The enclosures and mini-environments around wet benches that are designed to prevent accidental access and to isolate human contamination from the wafer can make it difficult to sample the bath. However, contamination-free sampling can be done in a safe way using high purity fluoropolymer apparatus and trained qualified personnel. 9.3 The utilization of unbiased, independent and experienced personnel in obtaining data at critical sampling sites with the UPW system where on -line instrumentation is not available is essential in determining the overall performance of the UPW system. 9.4 See Table 1, “UPW System Test Parameters, Sampling Points, and Recommended Monitoring Frequency for Assuring Good UPW System Operation” for sample point and monitoring frequency recommendations.

An integral particle filter is typically included in the same housing to remove particles.  \n5.1.4  regulator — a valve designed to reduce a high incoming pressure to a lower outlet pressure by automatically opening to allow flow until a desired, pre-set pressure on the outlet side is reached, and then automatically throttling to stop further pressure increase.  \n5.1.5  valve — a device that controls the flow or pressure of a gas.  Valve functions can include shut-off, metering, backflow prevention, and pressure relief.\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\n6.1 This test method is designed to provide comparative results for similar components.  It is not intended to replicate  process condition or actual use conditions. Components will be compared for their particle shedding performance after being exposed to moisture and corrosive gases, in this case hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas.  The component will be exposed alternately to corrosive gas and then to moist $1 0 0 \\mathrm { p p m }$ nitrogen gas several times.  The particle shed performance before and after exposure will be compared.  The overall test sequence is outlined in Figure 2.\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 7.1  Corrosive Gas Exposure Apparatus\n\n7.1.1  The corrosive gas exposure will be carried out using the apparatus shown in Figure 1.  \n7.1.2  Moisture Generator — Moisture generation is achieved using a permeation-source-type moisture generator.  The permeation source should be selected to provide $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p p m \\ H _ { 2 } O }$ in a flow of 500 sccm nitrogen. Records should be kept on the age of the permeation source so that a reliable source of moisture can be maintained.  \n7.1.3  Vacuum Generator — A Venturi or similar device capable of producing a rough vacuum of 85000 pascals (25 inches of mercury).  \n7.1.4  Point of HCl Introduction — The point at which gaseous hydrogen chloride HCl and $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ join the system (point A in Figure 1) should be designed so that the dead volume between the check valves is minimized. The check valves following V1 and V2 should be nearly joined to each other so as to minimize this volume.  \nLegend to figure 1\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 8  Reagents and Materials\n\n8.1  Nitrogen — Nitrogen with less than 50 ppbv moisture is to be used.  This can be accomplished with a point-of-use purifier as shown in Figure 1 or by using $9 9 . 9 9 9 9 9 \\%$ quality bulk nitrogen according to SEMI C3.49.  \n8.2  Hydrogen Chloride — Gaseous HCl should contain less than 1 ppmv $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ .  The HCl purifier shown in Figure 1 is optional unless the source gas contains greater than 1 ppmv $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ .  \nComplete enclosure of the HCl exposure apparatus in a forced-ventilation cabinet.

It is beyond the scope of this method to determine a statistically valid sample size, however it is recommend that multiple samples of each type are tested.\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\n11.1  Mass Spectrometer-based leak checking of the HCl exposure system after assembly, after the installation of each test component and after opening any connection.  \n11.2  Before each experiment and during idle times, the apparatus is to be kept in a constant purge condition. The following valve positions would apply during idle times:\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 9  Safety Precautions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 9  Safety Precautions\n\nContent: 9.1 This method involves the use of hazardous materials. The user should be experienced in the handling and use of corrosive specialty gases. 9.2 Safety precautions should include, but are not limited to: continuous air monitoring for HCl in the working environment as well as the ventilated enclosure. SCBA or other supplied air respiratory protection capable of use in gas exposure levels that may exceed immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) levels should be used during cylinder installation and start-up. 11.3 Moisture Stabilization — At least four hours prior to the start of a test, a constant flow of wet nitrogen $( 1 0 0 \\mathrm { \\ p p m { \\ H _ { 2 } O ) } }$ should be established through the sampling port so as to maintain a steady moisture output from the moisture generator. This is accomplished by opening valve V7. During this time, V4 is closed. 11.4 Moisture Level Verification — Once the moisture level is stabilized in Section 11.2, the moisture value\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 9  Safety Precautions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 9  Safety Precautions\n\nContent: measured on the analyzer should be recorded. This level must be $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p p m } \\pm \\ 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ or the test cannot proceed. 11.5 Following each test, the section of tubing between V3, V4 and the test piece must be replaced. This will minimize the particle contribution from the system due to system corrosion.\n\nSEMI F76-0303 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF PARTICLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAS SYSTEM COMPONENTS EXPOSED TO CORROSIVE GAS - # 12  Calibration\n\n12.1  Calibration of the mass flow controllers should be performed according to manufacturers recommendations.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on April 11, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org June 2003; to be published July 2003.\n\nSEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The purpose of this test method is to determine the relative resistance to pitting corrosion of the wetted surfaces of components intended for use in corrosive gas distribution systems for semiconductor manufacturing.  This test method is intended to differentiate between alloy compositions and processes intended to enhance the corrosion performance of the wetted surfaces.\n\nSEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method describes a procedure, based on the electrochemical critical pitting temperature (CPT), which is used to rank the pitting corrosion resistance of wetted surfaces of tubing or test coupons of representative finished surfaces intended for use in corrosive gas systems. Pitting corrosion is believed to be a major corrosion failure mode in semiconductor gas delivery systems, particularly in components and tubing welded and exposed to corrosive gases. 2.2 This test method is an adaptation of ASTM G150. The adaptation describes a method for performing the test method on coupons or wetted-surface sections cut from gas supply system components such as tubing. It is an aqueous immersion method. 2.3 The test method is reproducible and provides a metric (critical pitting temperature) in addition to a qualitative (visual) evaluation of corrosion resistance. 2.4 This test method applies to materials as specified in SEMI Standards referenced in Section 4.1, and to\n\nSEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: welds of these materials. 2.5 This test method may also be used for other corrosion resistant alloys and their welds not referenced in Section 4.1. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F77-0703 TEST METHOD FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CRITICAL PITTING TEMPERATURE TESTING OF ALLOY SURFACES USED IN CORROSIVE GAS SYSTEMS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Only analysts familiar with the instrumentation and technique should use this test method. 3.2 The test conditions of this test method do not simulate actual service in a corrosive gas supply system.

The tubing should be faced, and the cut ends should be masked with a non-reactive lacquer. 9.3 All specimens should be masked to isolate the test to the surface of interest only. This can be accomplished by masking with a non-reactive lacquer, which can be baked to ensure optimum adhesion. Alternately, plater’s tape can also be used, leaving 0.25 in. uncovered at the end for electrical contact. 9.4 Finish — In general, refer to ASTM G150 for details on the typical finish of the test specimens. Since surface finish can effect the CPT results, surface finished should be done as consistently as possible within a sample set.

However, epidemiological analyses have not identified any actual risk specific to stainless steels but have shown a slight excess of lung cancers among welders as a whole, i.e. both welders of non-alloyed steels and welders of stainless steels, compared with the general population. The cause of this excess has not been identified but may be connected with factors incidental to welding. Nevertheless, appropriate precautions to avoid exposure to welding fume of all kinds are advisable and indeed necessary if regulatory limits are to be observed. A1-1.2 There is an important difference between the chemical forms of chromium in fume from the flux processes and from the gas-shielded processes. In the former group most of the chromium is present in hexavalent form (chromates),\n\nSEMI F78-0304 PRACTICE FOR GAS TUNGSTEN ARC (GTA) WELDING OF FLUID DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A1-1 General (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F78-0304 PRACTICE FOR GAS TUNGSTEN ARC (GTA) WELDING OF FLUID DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS - # A1-1 General\n\nContent: while almost all chromium in fume produced by the gas-shielded processes is in the trivalent form and hexavalent compounds are only present in very small proportions. The relevance of this difference is that, without reference to welding, hexavalent chromium compounds are classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by the $\\mathrm { I A R C } ^ { 5 }$ particularly lung cancer. This fear is based on the chemical composition of the fume, especially that produced by the flux processes, and the very small size of the particles, which puts them in the respirable range, i.e., capable of penetration down to the level of the lung alveoli. Trivalent chromium compounds are unclassifiable to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3). Nickel compounds are also classified in Group 1 by the IARC.

It is assumed that silicon is in the wetted path as a coating or a silicon-based component (eg. a valve, orifice, sensor, mass flow controller) in the gas distribution system. The ambient temperature and operating temperature limits are typical for the industry.  No additional energy source, thermal, radiative or ionizing, is present.  The moisture content of the gas is not specified for the purpose of this guideline; the recommendations apply whether or not the conditions are anhydrous.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 4.1  SEMI Standard\n\nSEMI E52 — Practice for Referencing Gases Used in Digital Mass Flow Controllers  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 5  Classification of Gases\n\n5.1  The gases included are taken from SEMI E52; the number assigned to a gas is the same as in that document.  \n5.1.1  Inerts\n5.1.2  Hydrogen\n5.1.3  Hydrocarbons\n5.1.4  Halogenated Hydrocarbons\n5.1.5  Hydrides\n5.1.6  Halogens, other than Fluorine\n5.1.7  Halides, other than Fluorides\n5.1.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n5.1.9  Organo-metallic and Siloxanes\n5.1.10  Oxygen and Oxides and Sulfides\n5.1.11  Nitrogen and Nitrogen Compounds\n5.1.12  Acids\n5.1.13  Other\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.1  Inerts\n\n6.1.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are cited which indicate these gases do not react with silicon under the prescribed conditions.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.2  Hydrogen\n\n6.2.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are cited which indicate these gases do not react with silicon under the prescribed conditions.

Extensive review papers by Flamm (55) and Coburn (56) cite numerous references on the etching of silicon and other materials using halogenated hydrocarbons. The critical requirement for etching of silicon, or any material using a halogenated hydrocarbon, is a radical specie of fluorine, chlorine or other halogen. A low pressure plasma is the typical method of creating this radical. In addition, Winters (78) points out that for an “unassisted’ etching reaction to take place adsorption onto the silicon surface must be followed by four well defined steps. Should any of the steps not occur, or be interrupted, etching will not proceed. 6.4.2 Two of the most widely used halogenated hydrocarbons are $\\mathrm { C F _ { 4 } }$ and $\\mathrm { C _ { 4 } F _ { 8 } }$ . The Matheson Gas Book (79) says this about the chemical properties of\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.4  Halogenated Hydrocarbons (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.4  Halogenated Hydrocarbons\n\nContent: $\\mathrm { C F } _ { 4 }$ , “...Carbon tetrafluoride is extremely stable, reacting only slightly even at the temperature of a carbon arc...”.

Molecular or atomic chlorine, iodine or bromine have been reported not to etch silicon at temperatures below $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ orwithout the assistance of a plasma (19, 26, 50, 55, 56, 63). Schwartz (74) makes the comment. “Although $C l _ { 2 }$ chemisorbs spontaneously on silicon, (in a plasma) at low temperatures the reaction between $S i$ and $C l$ does not proceed to the formation of $S i C l _ { 4 }$ . That is, silicon does not etch in $C l _ { 2 }$ except at elevated temperature.” He goes on to note: “...except in the case of highly doped silicon, etching occurs at low temperatures in the reactive ion etching system not because of the ease of $C l$ attachment but because partially reacted silicon can be sputtered readily.” Schwartz then reports the observation that there was no perceptible etching after thirty minutes in a $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ plasma when there was no cathode bias on the wafer;\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.6  Halogens, other than fluorine (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.6  Halogens, other than fluorine\n\nContent: in contrast to 4.5 microns of removal when the bias was applied. 6.6.2 Flamm (55) published in 1981 and titled “The Design of Plasma Etchants”, states, ”...Chlorine containing halocarbon feed gases are frequently used instead of $C l _ { 2 }$ because they are not hazardous (before reaction), are noncorrosive, and they decompose in the plasma to generate radicals (in addition to chlorine atoms) which induce some desired effects.” This statement applies to a plasma based system; Flamm is pointing out the difficulty of etching silicon with just $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ or $ { \\mathbf { B } } { \\mathbf { r } } _ { 2 }$ in a plasma. He points out that Wang and Maydan (from a private communication in 1979) have etched silicon in a pure $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ plasma at pressures below 0.05 torr. 6.6.3 Flamm goes on to say that, “...It seems that chlorine and bromine atoms do not spontaneously etch $S i O _ { 2 }$ or undoped single crystal silicon but do etch some forms of polycrystalline\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.6  Halogens, other than fluorine (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.6  Halogens, other than fluorine\n\nContent: silicon and heavily $n$ -doped single crystal and polycrystalline silicon...” 6.6.4 A conclusion here is that even with a plasma $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathbf { B r } _ { 2 }$ require very specialized conditions to etch silicon.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides\n\nContent: 6.7.1 Gaseous mixtures of HCl, HBr or HI will not etch silicon at the prescribed conditions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 62). However, mild pitting of the silicon may be observed in HBr or HI under aqueous conditions (5). In laboratory testing (10) no reaction of the silicon was noted with $50 \\%$ aqueous HBr after 45 days immersion. 6.7.2 One reason for the lack of reactivity of silicon with chlorine, bromine or iodine halides is the low vapor pressure of the reaction product. $\\mathrm { S i C l } _ { 4 }$ has the lowest boiling point at $5 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ ; $\\operatorname { S i B r }$ boils at $1 5 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ and $\\mathrm { S i I } _ { 4 }$ at $2 8 6 ^ { \\circ }$ C. On the other hand, the boiling point of $\\mathrm { S i F } _ { 4 }$ is $- 8 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ . Practical advantages of this low vapor pressure and non-reactivity were demonstrated by Texas Instruments in their patents (24, 25) on RIE etching; controlled additions of HBr, HI,\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides\n\nContent: $\\mathrm { B C l } _ { 3 }$ , among other gases, led to passivating films of $\\mathrm { S i B r } _ { 4 }$ , etc. on the silicon side walls and allowed vertical wall etching to be achieved. 6.7.3 The moisture content of the gas stream can be a critical factor in the corrosion resistance of most materials. Typical stainless steel passivity is strongly dependent upon the amount of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ present, declining sharply as water content increases above 1 ppm in the presence of halogens or halides (6, 9, 10, 72). Paciej (72) reported that $0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ moisture in HCl does not attack 316L stainless, while $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ moisture in HCl can significantly corrode the surface of this material. Fine (9) points out similar behavior for 316L in HBr at $0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ and $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ moisture over the course of 10 days. 6.7.4 However, silicon corrosion resistance is virtually unaffected by moisture content up to and\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.7  Halides, Other Than Fluorides\n\nContent: including aqueous solutions. The “RCA clean” (67) and conventional wet etches (60, 68, 69) are obvious examples of this. 6.7.5 Silicon based halides, such as $\\mathrm { S i C l _ { 4 } }$ , $\\mathrm { S i H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ , etc. have not been reported to react with silicon under the prescribed conditions. (55)\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: 6.8.1 It is documented that fluorine $\\left( \\operatorname { F } _ { 2 } \\right)$ and atomic fluorine, F, will attack silicon at room temperature (19, 22, 26, 42, 49). 6.8.2 Chen (49) used fluorine gas $\\left( \\mathrm { F } _ { 2 } \\right)$ at room temperature on freshly cleaned silicon; he measured an etch rate of about $1 0 0 \\mathrm { A } ^ { \\circ }$ /min at 2.3 torr and 5 sccm of $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ flowing. He also noted a two to three hour incubation period before the etching started; the authors speculate about the causes for this incubation period. 6.8.3 Flamm (42) and Vasile (22) authored several papers detailing the mechanisms involved in atomic fluorine reacting with silicon. Flamm’s data produced the following relation for the etch rate of silicon by atomic fluorine. 6.8.4 R(Si) = 2.91\\*10-12\\*nFT1/2 e-Eetch/kT where Eetch is given as $0 . 1 0 8 \\ \\mathrm { e V }$ . At $\\mathrm { n _ { F } } = 2 . 9 ^ { * } 1 0 ^ { 1 5 }$ atoms/cc , the etch rate is reported to be about $3 {\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: , } 0 0 0 \\mathrm { A } ^ { \\circ }$ /min at $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ 6.8.5 Flamm used an RF discharge of at least 3.8 watts to produce F from $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ . Vasile used thermal dissociation of $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ to produce F; at $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ he measured $47 \\%$ dissociation; below $6 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ , negligible. 6.8.6 Flamm (55) also reports a similar relation for the etch rate of $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ by atomic fluorine: $\\mathrm { \\cal R } ( \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } ) ~ =$ 6.14\\*10-13\\*nFT1/2 e-Eet ch/kT where $\\mathrm { E _ { e t c h } }$ is given as $0 . 1 6 3 \\mathrm { e V }$ . 6.8.7 Flamm (55) states “...Fluorine atoms react spontaneously with all forms of silicon, $S i O _ { 2 }$ and silicon nitride to form volatile products.” 6.8.8 Ibbotson (19) examined potential etching processes which required no external energy sources. “Silicon is rapidly etched by the gas-phase halogen fluorides $C l F _ { 3 }$ $F _\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: { 3 } , B r F _ { 3 } , B r F _ { 5 } ,$ and $I F _ { 5 }$ , in analogy to $X e F _ { 2 }$ etching silicon..... By contrast, ClF and Groups III and $V$ fluorides such as $N F _ { 3 } , \\ B F _ { 3 } , \\ P F _ { 3 }$ and ${ P F } _ { 5 }$ do not spontaneously etch either $S i$ or $S i O _ { 2 }$ under the same experimental conditions.” 6.8.9 Winters (21) and Ibbotson (20) report that $\\mathrm { X e F } _ { 2 }$ does not etch $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ . Regardless, silicon, with or without additional oxide, is not recommended for use with $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { X e F } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { C l F } _ { 3 }$ and the other fluorine containing interhalogens which may spontaneously decompose to atomic fluorine at temperatures below $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ C. 6.8.10 As quoted from Ibbotson’s article above, excluded from this list of reactive gases are compounds such as ${ \\mathrm { N F } } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathbf { B F } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { P F } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { P F } _ { 5 }$\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: which have been reported not to etch Si or $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ without the assistance of a plasma or RF source (19) or require temperatures above $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ } ( 1 , 3 5 , 3 7 , 3 8 )$ . 6.8.11 The ionized fluorine atom, $\\mathrm { F }$ , is reported to not react with silicon under the prescribed conditions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 19, 64, 65, 66). Further evidence of this is the fact that adding $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ to fluorine containing plasmas reduces the etch rate (55). The assumed mechanism is the removal of F atoms as active species. 6.8.12 Other fluoride compounds, such as ${ \\mathrm { S F } } _ { 6 }$ , which do not spontaneously decompose to atomic fluorine below $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ are not a sourceof reaction (33, 34, 52, 53, 55). $6 . 8 . 1 3 \\mathrm { \\ W F _ { 6 } }$ is a special case. Numerous articles (41 ,43, 44, 45, 46, 47) have been published on the CVD of tungsten films from $\\mathrm { W F } _ { 6 }$ . Two primary mechanisms are\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: cited; the reduction of ${ \\mathrm { W F } } _ { 6 }$ by silicon and the thermal decomposition in the presence of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ . As stated in Yarmoff’s paper (43): “The dissociative chemisorption of $W F _ { 6 }$ on Si (111) was found to be complete, even at room temperature. The reaction is self-poisoning at room temperature, however as the fluorine liberated from $W F _ { 6 }$ ties up the active Si sites responsible for the dissociation.” 6.8.14 Tsao (41) reports that at $4 1 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ only $2 0 0 \\mathrm { A } ^ { \\circ }$ of W will deposit from ${ \\mathrm { W F } } _ { 6 }$ onto single crystal silicon which has an oxide thickness between 5 and $1 5 \\mathrm { ~ A } ^ { \\circ }$ . C.A. van der Jeugel (46) describes the effect of doping levels on the self-limiting growth of tungsten films. It is documented (44, 45, 47) that ${ \\mathrm { W F } } _ { 6 }$ will not deposit on $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ without the addition of hydrogen or some other initiation\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: mechanism. 6.8.15 Using the selective deposition characteristic of ${ \\mathrm { W F } } _ { 6 }$ in a device, Fleming, et.al. have patented (48) a technique for producing wear resistant coatings of tungsten. Their invention requires a “clean” surface and a temperature higher than $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } ~ \\mathrm { C } .$ , preferably around $4 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ ; exposure to $\\mathrm { W E }$ then results in a selfterminating film of $5 { - } 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . 6.8.15.1 Zdunek (80) reported on electrochemical based work which indicated that unprotected silicon surfaces exhibited “no degradation” after exposure to ${ \\mathrm { W F } } _ { 6 }$ for 5 days at $8 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ . A similar result was observed for $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ gas. 6.8.16 As a point of interest, metals such as stainless steel, aluminum and nickel develop corrosion resistant coatings of the respective fluoride when exposed to atomic fluorine during the proper passivation procedure\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.8  Fluorine and Fluorides\n\nContent: (14, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 39, 40). 6.8.17 Titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, brass and columbium have been reported to be unacceptable when exposed to gases such as $\\mathrm { C l F } _ { 3 }$ , which decompose to atomic fluorine (27, 32). In summary, it is recommended that neither silicon, silicon dioxide nor silicon nitride be in the wetted path when fluorine, $\\mathbf { F } _ { 2 } ,$ , or the halogen fluorides, $\\mathbf { C l F } _ { 3 } , \\mathbf { B r F } _ { 3 } , \\mathbf { B r F } _ { 5 } ,$ , and $\\mathbf { I F _ { 5 } }$ , plus $\\mathbf { X e F } _ { 2 }$ are in use.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.9  Organo-metallic and Siloxanes\n\n6.9.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are cited which indicate these compounds do not react with silicon under the prescribed conditions.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.10  Oxygen and Oxides and Sulfides\n\n6.10.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are cited which indicate these gases do not react with silicon under the prescribed conditions.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.11  Nitrogen and Nitrogen Compounds\n\n6.11.1  References (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 64, 65, 66) are cited which indicate these gases do not react with silicon under the prescribed conditions.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.12  Acids\n\n6.12.1  Aqueous HF is the only single acid reported to etch silicon (70).  Combinations of fluoride ions in solution with an oxidizing acid such as ${ \\bf H N O } _ { 3 }$ in an aqueous solution will etch silicon at practical rates (5, 54, 60, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69).  \n6.12.2  Madou (70) has an excellent review of the mechanisms required for aqueous based etching; he cites Hu and Kerr (72) to report an etch rate of $0 . 3 ^ { \\circ }$ A/min. for n-type, 2 ohm-cm (111) silicon in a $48 \\%$ HF solution at $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ .  Madou points out the strong dependence of etch rate in aqueous solutions on doping level, light conditions and relative potential.  \nNOTE 1:  Most bases will etch silicon and silicon dioxide; the oxide is etched very slowly.\n\nSEMI F79-0703 GUIDELINE FOR GAS COMPATIBILITY WITH SILICON USED IN GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPONENTS - # 6.13  Other\n\n6.13.1  As currently designated these are materials in SEMI E52-0302 not encountered in mass flow controllers under typical conditions.
