The load port door (at least on the seal zone plate) must also accommodate variations in angle (with respect to the Facial Datum Plane) of the FOUP door (however much the FOUP door varies in angle"

Only the mechanical interface is specified; no materials requirements or micro-contamination limits are given. The interface specified in this standard is designed for a tool with a sealed minienvironment, but it could also just be a well-defined automation interface.

R1-1 The intent of this standard is (1) To provide manually guided $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ carrier transport carts a standard location for docking to process and other tools; and (2) To facilitate development of a rapid repeatable cart to load port carrier transfer method or mechanism. Standardization of the size and location will allow for a modularity of the docking interface while minimizing limits on functionality of the interface. R1-2 Zone L is defined as an exclusion zone in tools that comply with SEMI E15.1. It is intended that the tool side of a “cart/tool” docking interface be mounted in this zone. R1-3 The docking interface (cart or tool side) may include all or some of the following features/functionality: Stopping cart motion, Dampening impact of docking, Compliance, Lead-in guidance for cart, Alignment of cart to docking"

R1-4 It is likely that the alignment error and tolerance stack-up between a device in Zone L and the tool port will not provide sufficient accuracy alone for accurate pick/placement of a carrier onto the kinematic couplings on the load port. R1-5 Possible sources of alignment errors are Cleanroom floor height and level, Cart wheels and framework, Installation accuracy of device in Zone L, and Stability of mounting (floor changes). R1-6 It may be necessary to use additional alignment methods to improve accuracy of carrier placement onto the kinematic couplings. R1-7 It is expected that the interface device will be floor-mounted. SEMI E64 allows for automatic docking but does not specify the means or interfaces required.

Electronically connect the DUT to a data acquisition system capable of recording indicated flow from the DUT. The test set-up should be set to give appropriate signals to the DUT so the DUT control valve will not dissipate power. For normally closed MFC’s, the setpoint should be zero, and for normally open MFC’s, the setpoint should be $100 \\%$ . Suggested orientation of the DUT is horizontal (base down). If the DUT is positioned otherwise, the orientation should be reported in the test data (see Figure 1). Valves are to be opened in a downstream-to-upstream sequence and closed in reverse fashion. The data acquisition system must be warmed up as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 10.2 Close shut-off valves. 10.3 In Table 1, record the time of day when power was applied to the DUT.

Furthermore, the remote parts of the equipment in the sub-fab must be capable of being installed so that the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the sub-fab is entirely underneath the rectangle defining the cost footprint in the main fab. In some fab designs (such as slab on grade), there is no sub-fab (or basement). In such cases, these requirements apply to the remote parts of the equipment in whichever equipment support area contains the same remote parts of the equipment as a sub-fab. Also, some fabs have multiple sub-fab levels. In such"

    "content": "5.2.1  Requirements — The maximum height of any equipment (other than a stocker) must be less than or equal to $H$ in the main fab and $H s$ in the sub-fab. Any connections for utilities and required overhead mainten-ance access must also be included within these limits. These limits also apply during installation, so if a part of the equipment must be rotated up into place, the diagonal measurement must be less than these limits.  \n5.2.2  Recommendations — Thus, equipment suppliers are advised to not plan on ceilings higher than these limits."

Furthermore, the maximum weight on any 0.6 m by $0 . 6 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (2 ft. by 2 ft.) floor tile (in any installation configuration) must be less than or equal to Mt. These limits also apply when the equipment is being moved into the fab and installed, unless spreader plates are used.  \n5.3.2  Recommendations — It is recommended that seismic loading also be considered when designing equipment weight distribution."

All parts of the equipment destined for the main fab must come in packages that are no taller than $Z$ and that are smaller than $X$ by $Y$ in two orthogonal horizontal dimensions. All parts of the equipment destined for the sub-fab must come in packages that are no taller than $Z s$ and that are smaller than $X s$ by $Y s$ in two orthogonal horizontal dimensions. Furthermore, none of these packages may weigh more than Mm each. This paragraph does not apply to stockers and AMHS transport equipment. 5.4.2 Recommendations — Equipment suppliers and device manufacturers might also consider carrier stocker size, move-in timing, and move-in path during stocker and facility design. Equipment that conforms to these limits may still be too large to fit into"

This requirement does not apply to maintenance performed on user interfaces, cart-docking interfaces, load ports, carrier buffers, and load locks.  \n5.5.2  Recommendations — It is recommended that as little regularly scheduled maintenance as possible be required from the side.  \n5.6  Width vs. Depth  \n5.6.1  Recommendations — In general, to minimize the number of bays required in a fab, it is recommended that equipment be designed to minimize width rather than depth."
