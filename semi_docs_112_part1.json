Such instruments must (1) meet the requirements of SEMI MF84, (2) be maintained in a state of control through the use of $\\overline { { \\boldsymbol X } }$ and $s$ instrument control charts (see Section 7.1.1), (3) return measured resistivity values of appropriate CRMs to within desired limits through measurement of resistivity CRMs at regular intervals (see Section 7.1.2), and (4) be operated within the temperature range specified in SEMI MF84 (see Section R2-4 of this guide). 7.1.1 Instrument Control Charts $- \\overline { { X } }$ and s control charts should be maintained to establish the stability of the instrument over the range of resistivity that the instrument is expected to measure. A separate control chart should be maintained for each reference wafer used.\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments\n\nContent: Initially, resistivity CRMs or other wafers with adequate radial resistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5.1) should be used for this purpose. As resistivity reference wafers are prepared, these should be used for maintaining the control charts. After in-house resistivity reference wafers become available, it is recommended that three wafers at each resistivity level be set aside for control charting. Two of these should be used for maintaining the $\\overline { { \\boldsymbol X } }$ and s charts on a regular basis. The third is retained as a reference to ensure that any apparently out-of-control conditions are due to the instrument and not to changes in sample surface conditions, as might occur after prolonged use of a particular sample. Each resistivity determination should consist of six to ten measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF84. Established procedures for generating and\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments\n\nContent: maintaining the control charts and for determining the existence of out-of-control conditions and the need for corrective action should be used. A suggested procedure for these determinations is given in Section R1-2 for use in organizations without previously established procedures. 7.1.2 Comparison with CRMs — To provide traceability, measurements of the resistivity of available CRMs that encompass the range of resistivity expected to be encountered should be made on a periodic, but less frequent, basis. In addition to being in control, the instruments should return measured values of the resistivity of the CRMs that do not deviate from their certified value by more than the root mean square of the two-sigma $9 5 \\%$ confidence level estimate) uncertainty of the CRM (Note 1) and the two-sigma instrument variability determined by control charting procedures (Note 2).

NOTE 1: A laboratory issuing a CRM should provide a comprehensive statement of its uncertainty associated with the measurement and reporting of the CRM value. This should include evaluations, or estimates, of both random and systematic “errors” following ISO procedures for Type A and Type B evaluations of components of uncertainty. The result would be expressed as a Combined Standard Uncertainty (standard deviation, or square-root of a sum of variances of uncertainty components), or as an “Expanded Uncertainty” (2 times the Combined Standard Uncertainty). If based on sufficient statistical degrees of freedom, the Combined Standard Uncertainty is a one-sigma estimate, and the Expanded Uncertainty is a two-sigma, or $9 5 \\%$ confidencelevel, estimate. If there\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments\n\nContent: are insufficient statistical degrees of freedom, the effective number of degrees of freedom should be reported by the CRM-issuing laboratory. It is then necessary to multiply the uncertainty value provided by the student-t factor appropriate to that number of degrees of freedom in order to obtain values for the one-sigma or twosigma $9 5 \\%$ confidence-level) measurement uncertainty. NOTE 2: A laboratory following this procedure to establish traceability to resistivity CRMs incorporates a value of its measurement uncertainty based on its control chart measurements, which evaluate random components of uncertainty only. If the laboratory then measures a value for the CRM within the total uncertainty interval, calculated following the root-mean-square procedure, above, about the certified value, its instrument is validated for use. If it measures a value outside the prescribed interval,\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments\n\nContent: this is an indication that its measurement bias with respect to true value is statistically significant at the $9 5 \\%$ level, and instrument repair, or “calibration” is necessary before proceeding. 7.1.3 Probe Assembly and Electrical Equipment Tests Should an out-of-control or out-of-specification condition be encountered, the probe assembly and electrical equipment can be tested in accordance with the section on Suitability of Test Equipment in SEMI MF84. These tests may serve to isolate the cause of the problem encountered. Either or both of these components should be repaired or replaced if they fail to meet the requirements specified in this section of SEMI MF84. NOTE 3: The stringent requirements on control of probe-tip spacing as well as the need for off-center diameter correction factors required for determination of radial resistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5) are a\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 7  Control of Primary Resistivity Measuring Instruments\n\nContent: consequence of the singleconfiguration method of using the four-point probe in accordance with SEMI MF84. Errors resulting from uncertainty in probe-tip spacing when using the singleconfiguration method are considered in Related Information 2. The probe-tip spacing requirements can be relaxed significantly if the dual-configuration method of measuring resistivity with a four-point probe is used. Use of this method is recommended for determination of the radial resistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5). However, the dualconfiguration method has not yet been standardized for bulk resistivity measurements because appropriate thickness correction factors have not yet been published. Such corrections are required for thickness to probe spacing ratios greater than 0.36. Nevertheless, it is noted that the most recently issued CRMs are calibrated and certified by this technique.6\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: 8.1 Factors that must be considered in selecting materials for resistivity reference wafers are nominal resistivity (see Section 8.2), wafer diameter (see Section 8.3), axial and radial uniformity of the resistivity (see Sections 8.4 and 8.5, respectively), wafer thickness (see 8.6), wafer conductivity type and surface orientation (see Section 8.7), and surface finish (see Section 9.1.2). It is generally desirable to qualify a crystal section for the desired parameters and then verify that individual wafers meet the requirements during the calibration procedure. The uniformity requirements, in particular, depend on the specific application of the reference wafers because different resistivity measuring instruments are sensitive to different volumes of material. 8.1.1 Four-point Probes — The most straightforward application of resistivity reference wafers is for\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: control of four-point probes used for measurement of resistivity and resistivity variation. If the wafer under test has the same geometry and surface characteristics as the reference wafer and if the same probe geometry is used for the measurement of both the reference wafer and the wafer under test, the transfer is direct and no special precautions need be observed. If the wafer under test has different thickness or diameter from the resistivity reference wafer or if four-point probes with different probe-tip spacings are used to measure the test and reference wafers, attention must be paid to the use of the appropriate correction factors. In particular, if the ratio of thickness to probe-tip spacing becomes too large, (Note 3) while the ratio of diameter to probe-tip spacing becomes too small, second order errors due to the use of two two-dimensional corrections\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: for a threedimensional geometry may become significant. Also, if different probe-tip spacings are used, differences in sampling volume must be recognized; in this case, resistivity uniformity of both the reference wafer and the wafer under test limits the transfer accuracy. If the wafer under test has a different surface condition from that of the reference wafer, it is necessary to demonstrate the equivalence of the resulting measurement value with that which would have been obtained had the same surface condition been employed for both. These considerations apply to singleconfiguration four-point probes. Because the standard test method for use of dual-configuration four-point probes is intended for sheet resistance, rather than bulkresistivity measurement, these concerns with thickness and diameter issues can be ignored. However, if the thickness is too great, an\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: unknown thickness correction factor must be used if bulk resistivity values are to be compared. 8.1.2 Eddy-current Gages — The eddy-current detector is sensitive to the integrated sheet resistance across the thickness of the wafer; in this respect it is similar to the four-point probe. However, the eddycurrent probe may weight various elements of the volume sampled differently than that of a four-point probe. Therefore, the weighted average resistivity seen in nonuniform wafers by the eddy current gage may not be the same as the center-point average resistivity value determined by the four-point probe. As a result, the accuracy of transfer between these types of instruments depends strongly on the macro-scale uniformity of the resistivity over the central area of the reference wafer. Because the eddy-current gage is a bulk measurement device, the thickness uniformity\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: over the area sampled by the eddy-current probe is also important. The upper limit of the expected reduction of transfer accuracy is given as follows: $$ = \\{ [ 1 + { \\frac { \\Delta \\rho } { \\rho } } ] \\times ( 1 + { \\frac { \\mathrm { T T V } } { w } } ) ] - 1 \\} \\times 1 0 0 $$ where: $\\rho$ $\\mathbf { \\tau } =$ average center-point resistivity of resistivity reference wafer, corrected to $2 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , in $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ , $_ { \\varDelta \\rho }$ = radial resistivity variation of resistivity reference wafer, corrected to $2 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , in $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ , over the area sampled by the eddy-current probe, ${ \\mathrm { T T V } } =$ total thickness variation of resistivity reference wafer, in $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , over the area sampled by the eddy-current probe, and $w$ $\\ c =$ average thickness of\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: resistivity reference wafer, in $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . 8.1.3 Spreading Resistance Probes — Because the spreading resistance probe samples a volume that is exceedingly small compared with the volume sampled by the four-point probe, the most critical reference wafer parameter for accurate transfer of resistivity value is the micro-variation of the resistivity both axially and radially. Very complex and timeconsuming procedures are required to determine the micro-scale depth and lateral variations of resistivity in a reference wafer (see Sections 8.4.3 and 8.5.2, respectively). Further, the procedures for determining micro-scale depth profiles are destructive and cannot be carried out on the reference wafer itself. Consequently, for this application crystals should be grown by procedures that result in the best possible uniformity.

Such probes sample a lateral area much smaller than the four-point probe and a depth that is only a very tiny fraction of the wafer thickness. To ensure that the resistivity in the region sampled by the mercury probe can be taken as the resistivity measured by the four-point probe, it is necessary to establish that both the macro- and microscale variations in resistivity of the reference wafer are within tolerable\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: limits. Thus, it is desirable to use highly uniform crystal such as NTD FZ or $\\mathbf { M C z }$ crystal for resistivity reference wafers for this application (see Section 8.1.3). It is further required in this case to establish the net carrier density of the reference wafer from the resistivity measurement (see Section 9.2.4). 8.2 Resistivity — The center-point resistivity of the reference wafer should be chosen to meet the requirements of the measuring instrument to be calibrated or controlled. Most of the test methods cited in Section 1.2 specify the resistivity range of the required resistivity reference wafers. 8.2.1 Four-point Probes For control of instrumentation for making four-point probe resistivity measurements in accordance with SEMI MF84, it is recommended that a minimum of three resistivity reference wafers, with resistivity values in the upper,\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: middle, and lower portions of the resistivity range of interest be used (Note 4). It is preferable to use more closely spaced resistivity reference wafers to ensure instrument linearity over the entire measurement range. If only a narrow resistivity range (less than $\\pm 2 5 \\%$ of the nominal value) needs to be measured, it is sufficient to use two resistivity reference wafers at the extremes of this range. Similar considerations apply for control of instrumentation for making sheet resistance measurements in accordance with SEMI MF1529, except that, in this case, of course, the parameter of interest is the sheet resistance rather than the resistivity. NOTE 4: For control of instrumentation for making fourpoint probe measurements over a narrow resistivity range, it may be appropriate to use only one or two resistivity reference wafers. 8.2.2 Eddy–Current Gages — For\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: calibration of eddy current resistivity measuring instruments, SEMI MF673 specifies that for calibration by Method I, five reference wafers that span the full resistivity range of the instrument are required. However, many organizations prefer to use many more reference wafers for the Method I calibration. Two resistivity reference wafers at the extremes of a narrow resistivity range (typically less than about $\\pm 2 5 \\%$ of the nominal value) are required for Method II calibration. 8.2.3 Spreading Resistance Probes — For calibration of spreading resistance equipment, SEMI MF672 recommends use of at least three resistivity reference wafers per decade over the range of resistivity to be measured. Regular spacing is desirable, but it may not be possible to secure samples with adequate uniformity with arbitrary nominal resistivity values. Selection of samples for\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: micro-scale uniformity should take precedence over regular spacing. 8.2.4 Mercury Probes — The resistivity of a resistivity reference wafer intended for use in calibrating mercury probe systems for making net carrier density measurements in accordance with SEMI MF1392 or SEMI MF1393 is specified to be between one-half and two times the resistivity of the specimens to be measured. However, there is some benefit to employ several resistivity reference wafers with a range of resistivity from very high (net carrier density less than about $1 { \\times 1 0 } ^ { 1 4 } ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } )$ to the lowest value to be measured. 8.3 Wafer Diameter — Resistivity reference wafers do not need to be the same diameter as the wafers to be measured by the system; any diameter that fits the instrumentation and its associated wafer handling is, in principle, acceptable.\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: However, advances in crystal growing design and control together with certain aspect ratio considerations make it likely that superior radial resistivity uniformity in the central region of the wafer can be obtained with larger diameter $( \\geq 1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } )$ wafers as compared to that of smaller diameter wafers. In addition, the diameter correction factor for wafers 100 mm in diameter and larger measured with a four-point probe with probe-tip spacing of $1 . 5 9 \\mathrm { m m }$ is within $0 . 2 \\%$ of its limiting value of $\\pi / \\ln 2$ $\\mathit { \\Omega } ^ { \\prime } = 4 . 5 3 2 4 )$ . Consequently, errors due to small variations in diameter or probe placement at the wafer center are negligibly small (see Section R2-3.1), and the second order errors associated with the combination of the thickness and diameter correction factors can also be neglected.\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 13)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: The latter point is particularly significant when four-point probes with small probe-tip spacings are employed on standard thickness wafers because the thickness correction factor for such geometries varies rapidly with thickness (see Section 8.6). 8.3.1 Because of the relative insensitivity of the calculated center-point resistivity to the exact value of diameter for large diameter wafers, it is usually adequate to assume the nominal diameter of standard commercially available wafers specified in accordance with SEMI M1. However, diameter correction factors are usually required for off-center resistivity measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF81. When required, diameter measurements should be made at the positions outlined in SEMI MF2074. 8.4 Axial Resistivity Uniformity — The uniformity of the resistivity along the crystal axis is important for all\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 14)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: applications in which the sampling volume of the measuring instrument in the direction perpendicular to the wafer surface is different from that of the certifying or calibrating instrument. In addition, gross axial uniformity along a crystal section may be ascertained in order to qualify the section as a source of resistivity reference wafers of a particular resistivity prior to slicing the section. 8.4.1 Very crude indications of the range of centerpoint resistivity within a crystal section may be obtained from measurements made on the ends of the section in accordance with the Four-probe Method of SEMI MF43. While these measurements provide a useful preliminary screen for the crystal section, they cannot be relied upon to give accurate values of resistivity. 8.4.2 Somewhat more accurate but still gross indications of axial resistivity uniformity may be obtained\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 15)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: from measurements of the resistivity at the center of wafers in accordance with SEMI MF84 as a function of position along the crystal section. However, because of local fluctuations in dopant incorporation as the crystal was grown, this procedure does not yield reliable information about the center-point resistivity of any wafer that is not measured. In addition, it does not yield information about the local variation in resistivity as a function of depth from the wafer surface, even if center-point resistivity measurements are made on each wafer in the section. 8.4.3 For use in connection with measurements in which the sampling volume differs from the sampling volume of an in-line four-point probe with 1.59 $[ 1 0 / ( 2 \\pi ) ]$ mm spacing as specified in SEMI MF84, transfer accuracy is affected by local resistivity uniformity. In particular, the resistivity in the\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 16)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: nearsurface region sampled by spreading resistance or mercury probes may differ significantly from the average resistivity of the resistivity reference wafer. Depth profiles of resistivity near the wafer surface may be obtained from spreading resistance measurements on beveled sections in accordance with SEMI MF672. To obtain depth profiles across the entire wafer, spreading resistance measurements can be made on a cleaved or polished perpendicular section; special fixtures are required for these measurements, which do not provide the depth resolution of an angle beveled section. Since relative measurements only are required, accurate calibration of the spreading resistance probe is not necessary; however, linearity is important. Two difficulties with this approach must be recognized. First, if beveled specimens are employed, the possibility of mixing the vertical\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 17)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: and horizontal resistivity variations must be considered. Second, because the method is destructive, the resistivity variation of the actual material being used for the resistivity reference wafer cannot be determined directly at the center of a resistivity reference wafer; it can only be inferred from measurements on nearby sections or adjacent wafers. 8.5 Radial Resistivity Uniformity — The uniformity of the resistivity along the surface of the resistivity reference wafer is important for all applications in which the measuring instrument samples a different area than the certifying or calibrating instrument. Since all resistivity measurements other than those conducted in accordance with SEMI MF84, including four-point probe measurements made with probes with different probe-tip spacing, sample different areas, this factor is one of the most significant\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 18)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: limitations in transfer of resistivity values from one instrument to another. 8.5.1 Large scale (macro) variations in resistivity across the surface of a wafer can be measured with a four-point probe. 8.5.1.1 Coarse indications can be obtained using an inline four-point probe in accordance with SEMI MF81 modified to yield a nine-site map of resistivity variation over the central $3 8 \\mathrm { - m m }$ diameter region of the wafer. In addition to four-point probes, eddy current instruments are frequently used for these measurements. Although the procedures for using eddy current instruments for measuring resistivity variation are not standardized, they provide an adequate measure of radial resistivity variation, especially in the central region of the wafer where edge effects are not significant. Although more dense patterns may be measured, they are very\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 19)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: inconvenient to obtain manually using either a four-point probe or an eddy current instrument. 8.5.1.2 Several commercial automated mapping instruments that utilize dual-configuration, in-line, four point probes5 or square-array four-point probes7 are available. These instruments provide for collection of sufficient data to enable determination of the macroscale variation of the sheet resistance in detail adequate for the application. Measurements should be taken in a 49-site pattern consisting of the center point and sites on three equally spaced, concentric circles as specified in SEMI MF1618. In this pattern the inner, middle, and outer circles have 8, 16, and 24 sites, respectively. The nominal diameter of the outer circle should be $3 8 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (Note 5). Procedures for measurements with squarearray four-point probes have not been standardized.\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 20)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: Dual-configuration sheet resistance measurements using in-line four-point probes should be made in accordance with SEMI MF1529. Since the thickness correction factor is not established for dualconfiguration probes, the resistivity at each measurement site cannot be calculated accurately. However, provided that the wafer thickness is sufficiently uniform, determination of the sheet resistance is adequate for this application because relative values are all that are required to establish the variation. 8.5.2 Micro-scale variations in resistivity across the surface of a wafer can be established by means of spreading resistance measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF525. It is especially important to minimize such variations in material to be used as resistivity reference wafers for spreading resistance calibrations. Because of the high density of data points\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 21)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: required to obtain information on micro-scale variations over a meaningful area, long times are required for making these measurements. NOTE 5: If it is desired to qualify a larger area of a wafer for use in preparing chip sets for spreading resistance calibration, the uniformity of both resistivity and thickness should be determined over the larger area of the wafer. For determinations of macro-scale radial resistivity uniformity, it is recommended that, as a minimum, the site density used in evaluating the central region of the wafer (see Section 8.5.1.2) be maintained. Table 1 lists the minimum number of sites required for areas of various diameters. Micro-scale variations should also be determined over the larger area, but because it is impractical to make detailed micro-scale variation measurements on each wafer, each chip should be evaluated for micro-scale\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers (Part 22)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # 8  Selection and Qualification of Materials for Resistivity Reference Wafers\n\nContent: resistivity variations prior to use.8 8.6 Wafer Thickness — Resistivity reference wafers should be thick enough to avoid extreme fragility and to allow determination of the center-point thickness to $\\pm 0 . 2 5 \\%$ but not too thick to require large corrections to the thin wafer equation for resistivity (see Section R2- 3.2). A thickness of 625 to $8 7 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ is recommended for resistivity reference wafers. Wafers with thickness as small as $5 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ may be used, but particular attention must be given to control of the total thickness variation (see Section 9.1.1).

For probes with 1.016- mm $( 4 0 \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { m i l } )$ spacing, the thickness correction is about $1 \\%$ for a test specimen thickness of $6 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , increasing to about $5 \\%$ at $8 7 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .

Therefore determination of thickness should be made as accurately as possible.

This method, however, has only marginal precision for this application. If automated methods are used for determining radial resistivity uniformity (see Section 8.5.1.2), the average thickness and total thickness variation should be determined over the central $3 8 \\mathrm { - m m }$ diameter circle (Note 5) in accordance with SEMI MF1530. 8.6.3 The various errors in resistivity determination that result from uncertainties in thickness are discussed in Section R2-3.2. 8.7 Wafer Conductivity Type and Surface Orientation — For control of four-point probes or for calibrating eddy current probes, conductivity type and surface orientation do not influence the result.

For low resistivity reference wafers, $p$ -type (100) or (111) wafers are most appropriate, while for high resistivity reference wafers, $n$ -type (neutron transmutation doped) wafers of either orientation are preferred. For use in calibrating mercury probes, the conductivity type of the reference wafers must match that of the specimens to be tested. For use in calibrating spreading resistance instruments, the type and surface orientation of the reference wafers must match those of the specimens to be tested. NOTE 6: When uniformity considerations are the dominant issue, the following should be kept in mind.

Etching immediately after slicing in either KOH etching solution (see Section 5.4) or etching solution $( 1 5 + 1 )$ (see Section 5.5) is recommended to remove damage introduced during slicing. Subsequent lapping with 5 to $9 \\mathrm { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ aluminum oxide abrasive is intended to provide both control of thickness variation and a uniform matte surface. 9.1.1 The total thickness variation (TTV) of resistivity reference wafers should be as small as possible.

For $6 2 5 \\mathrm { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick wafers, this would require $\\mathrm { T T V } \\le 1 2 . 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . In most cases, it should be possible to obtain lapped wafers with $\\mathrm { T T V } \\leq$ $6 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ over the entire wafer and $\\mathrm { T T V } \\leq 3 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ $( \\pm 0 . 2 5 \\%$ of the center-point thickness) over the region of the wafer where the resistivity uniformity is determined (see Section 8.5.1.2).

This surface finish was originally chosen to provide good probe-tip and specimen-surface wear together with sufficient smoothness to reduce probe wander.9 However, resistivity reference wafers intended for calibration of mercury probe and spreading resistance instruments must be polished. On the other hand, if polished wafers are used for four-point probe measurements, difficulties may be encountered with accumulated probe damage and the resultant contact quality degradation or surface charge, or both.

R1-1.2 Two $\\overline { { \\boldsymbol X } }$ and s charts are used for the control of primary resistivity measuring instruments. One of these is the usual type of chart for which the control limits are established from measurements made with the instrument (see Section 7.1.1). The second, intended to ensure traceability, differs from the usual control chart in that it has limits that are based not on the measurements themselves but instead on the characteristics of the CRMs used for the measurements (see Section 7.1.2). These two types of control charts are of the types intended to provide control with no standard given and control with respect to a given standard, respectively.10 R1-1.3 The third type of chart is one based on individual measurements and the moving range, which is\n\nSEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # R1-1   Types of Control Charts (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1527-1104 GUIDE FOR APPLICATION OF CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS AND REFERENCE WAFERS FOR CALIBRATION AND CONTROL OF INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING RESISTIVITY OF SILICON - # R1-1   Types of Control Charts\n\nContent: the difference between one measurement and the next.

Otherwise, the accuracy and precision can be degraded.  \n3.4  The accuracy and precision of the measurement degrade significantly as the roughness of the specimen surface increases.  This degradation can be avoided by using polished etched surfaces.  \n3.5  Variability of boron in the calibration standards can limit the measurement precision.  \n3.6  Bias in the assigned boron concentration of the calibration standard can introduce bias into the SIMS measured boron.\n\nSEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI M1 Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology\n\nSEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 4.2  ASTM Standard\n\nE 122 — Practice for Choice of Sample Size to Estimate a Measure of Quality of a Lot or Process1  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 5.1  Definitions\n\n5.1.1  ion mass spectrometry — the separation and counting of ions by their mass-to-charge ratio.  \n5.1.2  primary ions — ions created and focused by an ion gun onto the specimen surface to sputter ionize surface atoms.  \n5.1.3  secondary ion mass spectrometry mass spectrometry performed upon secondary ions from the specimen surface.  \n5.1.4  secondary ions — ions that leave the specimen surface as a result of the primary ion beam sputter ionizing the specimen surface atoms.  \n5.2  For definitions of other terms used in silicon wafer technology refer to SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 6  Summary of Test Method (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: 6.1 Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is utilized to determine the bulk contamination of boron in single crystal, heavily doped $n$ -type silicon substrates. 6.1.1 Specimens of single crystal silicon (one silicon specimen with very low boron concentration, such as a high resistivity $n$ -type float-zone silicon specimen, to be used as an instrumental BLANK; one calibration specimen made of a bulk-doped boron silicon wafer; and the test specimens) are loaded into a sample holder. 6.1.2 An oxygen primary ion beam is used to bombard each specimen. 6.1.3 The positive secondary ions are mass analyzed. 6.1.4 The BLANK silicon sample is sputtered to determine instrumental background. 6.1.5 The samples are then analyzed for boron and silicon in a sequential manner throughout the holder. 6.1.6 The ratio of the measured boron and silicon secondary ion intensities $( \\mathbf { B } ^ { + } / \\mathbf { S } ^ { + } )$ is calculated for each specimen. 6.1.7\n\nSEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 6  Summary of Test Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: The $( \\mathrm { B } ^ { + } / \\mathrm { S i } ^ { + } )$ ratios of the test specimens are then converted to boron concentrations by linear scaling from the $( \\mathrm { B } ^ { + } / \\mathrm { S i } ^ { + } )$ ratio of the calibration specimen that has a known boron concentration. 6.1.8 No crater measurement is required.\n\nSEMI MF1528-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING BORON CONTAMINATION IN HEAVILY DOPED n-TYPE SILICON SUBSTRATES BY SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY - # 7  Apparatus\n\n7.1  Magnetic Sector SIMS Instrument, equipped with an oxygen primary ion source, electron multiplier detector, and Faraday cup detector or daley detector capable of measuring positive secondary ions.

The uniformity across a wafer of the sheet resistance resulting from any of these processes is important for the equivalence of performance of devices or circuits made from various regions of the wafer. 1.2 This test method uses a four-point probe in a manner different from that of other ASTM methods for the measurement of the resistivity or sheet resistance of semiconductors. In this test method, two different ways (configurations) of connecting the probe pins to the electronics that supply current and measure voltage are used at each measurement location on the specimen. This use of a four-point probe is often referred to as “dual-configuration” or as “configuration switched” measurements. 1.3 There are three benefits that result from the second measurement configuration at each location: (1) the probe no longer needs to\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: be in a high symmetry orientation on the specimen, that is, being perpendicular or parallel to the radius on a circular wafer or to the length or width of a rectangular specimen, as long as it is a modest distance from the edge of the wafer, (2) the lateral dimension(s) of the specimen, and the exact location of the probe on the specimen no longer have to be known—the geometric scaling factor results directly from the two sets of electrical measurements at each location, (3) the two sets of measurements self-correct for the actual separations between the probe pins in a manner that has been shown to be more effective than measuring probe impressions made on a piece of polished material. As a result, high precision measurements can be made with smaller probe separations than is possible with single configuration use of a four-point probe, thus allowing higher spatial resolution of wafer sheet resistance variations. 1.4 This test method is intended primarily for\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 1  Purpose (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: assessing the uniformity of layers formed by diffusion, epitaxy, ion implant and chemical vapor, or other deposition processes on a silicon substrate. The deposited film, which may be single crystal, polycrystalline or amorphous silicon, or a metal film, must be electrically isolated from the substrate. This can be accomplished if the layer is of opposite conductivity type from the substrate or is deposited over a dielectric layer such as silicon dioxide. This test method is capable of measuring films as thin as $0 . 0 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , but particular care is required for establishing reliable measurements for most films in the range below $0 . 2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . Films that have a thickness up to half the probe separation can be measured without the use of a thickness-related correction factor. It may give misleading results for films formed by silicon on insulator technologies because of charge or charge trapping in the insulator. 1.5 This test\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 1  Purpose (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: method can be used to measure the sheet resistance uniformity of bulk substrates. However, the thickness of the substrate must be known to be constant or must be measured at all positions where sheet resistance values are measured in order to calculate relative variations in resistance reliably. NOTE 1: The thickness correction factor for layers that are thicker than 0.5 times the probe spacing is known to vary more rapidly than that for single-configuration four-probe measurements, but such a correction has not yet been published. Until such a correction is published, resistivity values determined by the dual-configuration method will not be accurate for these thicker specimens; however, if the wafer has uniform thickness, variations of resistivity can still be determined by this test method. 1.6 This test method is suitable for use in materials acceptance, equipment qualification, process control, research, and development.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method covers the direct measurement of the sheet resistance and its variation for all but the periphery (amounting to three probe separations) for circular conducting layers pertinent to silicon semiconductor technology. These layers may be fabricated on substrates of any diameter that is capable of being securely mounted on a prober stage. NOTE 2: The equation used to calculate the sheet resistance data from measurements is not perfectly accurate out to the edge of the wafer for probes oriented at an arbitrary angle with respect to a wafer radius. Further, automatic instruments on which this test method will be performed may not have perfect centering of the wafer on the measurement stage. These factors require that the periphery of the layer being measured be excluded. Also, many thin film processes use wafer clamps that preclude forming layers out to the edge of the substrate. The edge exclusion in this test method applies to the film that is being\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: measured, rather than to the substrate. The equation used is based on mathematics developed for layers of circular shape. It is expected to work well for layers of other shapes such as rectangular, if edge exclusion requirements are met; however, the accuracy near the edge of other shapes has not been demonstrated.2 2.2 This test method can be used to measure sheet resistance values from below $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\Omega$ for metal films, to over $2 5 0 0 0 \\Omega$ for thin silicon films. However, for films at the upper end of this resistance range, and for films toward the low end of the thickness range, the interpretation of the sheet resistance values may not be straightforward due to various semiconductor effects.3,4,5 NOTE 3: The principles of this test method are also applicable to other semiconductor materials, but the appropriate conditions and the expected precision have not been established. 2.3 This test method uses two different electrical configurations\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: of the four-point probe at each measurement location. It does not require measurement of probe location on the wafer, or probe separations, or of wafer diameter (except to determine edge exclusion for measurement-site selection) as do other four-point probe methods such as Test Methods SEMI MF81, SEMI MF84 and SEMI MF374. By use of electrical data from the two different configurations at each location, the method is self-calibrating with respect to the geometrical parameters.1 2.4 This test method is intended to be used on automated wafer testing systems that use R-theta or X Y stage positioning for the measurements. The rapid calculations for sheet resistance used in this test method are based on more extensive calculations, and are within $0 . 1 \\%$ of the results of those more extensive calculations, even if the probes are not oriented parallel or perpendicular to a wafer radius, providing that the probes are more than 3-probe spacings from the edge of the layer\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: being measured1,2 (see Note 1). 2.5 Use of two electrical configurations at each measurement site eliminates the need for measurement of geometric separation of the probe tips in order to analyze the data. As a result, even for referee measurements, any probe spacing that is agreed upon between the parties to the test and demonstrates sufficiently low data scatter may be used for this test method. 2.6 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses are for information only. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Photoconductive and photovoltaic effects can seriously influence the measured sheet resistance, particularly with high resistivity layers or those with very shallow junctions. Therefore, all measurements should be made in a darkened enclosure unless experience shows that the material of interest is insensitive to ambient illumination. 3.2 Spurious currents can be induced in the test circuit when the equipment is located near high-frequency generators. If such a location is unavoidable, adequate shielding must be provided. 3.3 Minority carrier injection during the measurement can occur due to the electric field in the specimen. With material possessing a long minority-carrier lifetime and moderate to high resistivity, such injection can result in a lowering of the resistivity (sheet resistance) for a distance of several centimeters from the point of injection. Carrier injection can be detected by repeating the measurements at lower current. In the absence of\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: injection, no increase in resistivity should be observed at the lower current. The current level recommended, (see Table 1) should reduce the probability of difficulty from this interference to a minimum, but in cases of doubt the measurements should be repeated at a lower current level. If the proper current is being used, doubling or halving its value should result in a change of sheet resistance that is less than $0 . 5 \\%$ . Table 1 Nominal Current Values for Measurement of Sheet Resistance #1 The current used should be from one-half to twice the nominal value and should be chosen to give a measured voltage on the specimen that is between 7 and $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ when using Configuration $A$ . Once the current is selected for forward direction measurements at a given site, it must be kept constant to $0 . 0 1 \\%$ for the remaining measurements at that site. 3.7 Use of the data from the two electrical configurations to calculate a factor for water\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: diameter and for position of the measurement site on the wafer is accurate to within $0 . 1 \\%$ as long as the measurement site is away from the perimeter of the wafer. To meet this requirement the site should be at least five-probe separations from the perimeter for the case of probe alignment perpendicular to a wafer diameter, and at least three-probe separations from the perimeter for the case of probe alignment parallel to a wafer diameter. For certain processes, such as ion implantation, use of a wafer clamp during layer formation causes a $p$ -n layerto-substrate junction on the top surface of the wafer interior to the mechanical edge of the wafer. In these cases, the probe separation values above refer to the location of the measurement site with respect to such junctions. 3.4 Semiconductors have a significant temperature coefficient of resistivity. Consequently, the measurement current used should be small to avoid resistive heating. The current levels\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: recommended should reduce the chances of this problem. If resistive heating is suspected, it can be detected by a change in readings starting immediately after the current is applied. If such a change is observed, repeat the electrical measurements at a lower current. In the absence of Joule heating, the temperature of the water should be uniform if the wafer is mounted on a chuck having good thermal conductivity and large thermal mass. Sheet resistance maps should not be distorted by temperature non-uniformities in this case. Coefficients for the temperature variation of the sheet resistance of a particular layer type will depend upon the specific dopant, or resistivity, profile of that layer type, and must be evaluated empirically for the layer fabrication process being used if correction of data to a fixed reference temperature is desired. 3.5 Vibration of the probe may cause variations in contact resistance, which is often manifested as unstable readings. If\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: difficulty is encountered, the apparatus should be vibration isolated. $3 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { { I n } }$ shallow or lightly-doped layers, an effect known as carrier redistribution causes the number of free carriers in the layer to be different from the number of dopant atoms. As a result, sheet resistance values measured by this test method may be noticeably different from values calculated from models that imply the dopant and free-carrier depth profiles to be equivalent. 3.9 Surface and near-surface effects, such as the formation of hydrogen complexes with acceptors, may occur during or immediately after the fabrication of many thin films, particularly if lightly doped. They may also occur slowly with storage. These effects may be uniformly or non-uniformly distributed across the wafer surface. The result is to modify, generally by way of increasing, the measured sheet resistance. Two of the most prominent impacts of these effects are to make the results of a\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: given process step appear to be more non-uniform than is actually the case, and to shift the absolute level of a reference wafer used to monitor the performance of the mapping tool so as to make the tool appear to be out of control. 3.6 Penetration of either the current or voltage probes through the layer being measured to the substrate results in erroneous readings. This can usually be checked by mounting the specimen directly on a metal support that is grounded to the current supply and by then looking for a reduction in measured specimen voltage in at least one polarity as the ground connection is removed and replaced. If this condition occurs, examine the probe tips microscopically for sharp asperities and remove these by polishing or otherwise conditioning the probe tip, or else reduce the probe force or use a probe with blunter probe tips.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 4.1 SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI C19 — Specification for Acetone  \nSEMI C23 — Specifications for Buffered Oxide Etchants\nSEMI C41 — Specifications and Guidelines for 2- Propanol\nSEMI M1 Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers\nSEMI MF42 — Test Methods for Conductivity Type of Extrinsic Semiconducting Materials  \nSEMI MF81 — Test Method for Measuring Radial Resistivity Variation on Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF84 — Test Method for Measuring Resistivity of Silicon Wafers with an In-line Four-Point Probe  \nSEMI MF374 — Test Method for Sheet Resistance of Silicon Epitaxial, Diffused, Polysilicon, and IonImplanted Layers Using an In-Line Four-Point Probe with the Single-Configuration Procedure  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology  \nSEMI MF1618 — Practice for Determination of Uniformity of Thin Films on Silicon Wafers\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 4.2 ASTM Standard\n\nD 5127 — Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in the Electronics and Semiconductor Industry6  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1 For definitions of terms used in silicon wafer technology refer to SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 6  Summary of Test Method (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: 6.1 An in-line four-point probe is used to determine the specimen sheet resistance at each desired measurement location. 6.1.1 The number and positioning of measurement locations is determined by end-use needs, or by the parties to the test in the case of referee measurements. 6.1.2 At each location, a direct current is passed into the specimen, using two of the probes, as specified, and the potential difference is measured using the other two probes. 6.1.3 Current polarity is reversed and the potential difference is re-measured to allow elimination of thermoelectric effects. 6.1.4 Before the probe is raised, the process is repeated using a different combination of probes, as specified. At each location, the sheet resistance is obtained from the four ratios of potential difference to current. 6.2 The adequacy of the probe is determined both by optical examination of probe indentations made in a polished silicon surface, and by a performance test on a\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 6  Summary of Test Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: wafer of the type whose uniformity is to be checked. 6.3 The accuracy of the electronics is tested by means of an analog circuit emphasizing the performance and noise immunity of the electronics in the presence of large contact resistances of the probe tips to the semiconductor surface.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.1 Specimen Preparation\n\n7.1.1 Chemical Laboratory Apparatus — Such as plastic beakers, graduated cylinders, and plastic coated tweezers for use both with acids and with solvents.

The included angle of the tips shall be in the nominal range 45 to $1 5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The probe tips shall be in a straight line with nominally equal separations in the range $2 5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ (0.010 in.) to $1 . 5 9 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ (0.0625 in.). An isolation resistance between adjacent probes, a factor of $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ larger than the sheet resistance of the film is required; a value of $1 0 ^ { 9 } ~ \\Omega$ , or greater, is recommended for the widest general application. Recommended tip radii and probe force values are slightly different depending upon whether the probe force is applied by springs, or deadweight, as follows: 7.2.1.1 Spring-loaded Probes — Having tips that terminate in a radius in the nominal range 25 to $2 5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ or in a flat circular truncation of the cone with a circle diameter in the range 50 to\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.2 Probe Assembly (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.2 Probe Assembly\n\nContent: $1 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . A probe force per pin of 0.25 to $2 . 0 \\ : \\mathrm { N }$ (approximately 25 to 200 gf) may be needed to cover the variety of films that are covered under the scope of this test method. 7.2.1.2 Deadweight-loaded Probes — Having probe tips that terminate in a radius of at least $1 9 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . A probe force per pin of 0.1 to $1 \\mathrm { ~ N ~ }$ (approximately 10 to 100 gf) may be needed to cover the variety of films that are covered under the scope of this test method. NOTE 4: In general, the blunter the probe tip, the higher the probe force that is used to make good electrical contact to the layer. Conversely, the sharper the probe tip, or the thinner the layer, the lighter the probe force that should be used. The upper end of the allowed probe force range is generally used only for buried-peak conducting layers, such as MeV implants, or for high-resistivity, thick epitaxial layers. General experience indicates\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.2 Probe Assembly (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.2 Probe Assembly\n\nContent: that there is not a simple specification of one or two combinations of probe radius and probe force that will cover all layers of interest. Experience with conditioning probe tips against materials such as a sapphire or non-polished ceramic substrate, or even on a piece of lapped silicon, indicates that the microroughness of the probe tip is a very important, but not-readily specifiable parameter for the proper probe type in a given application. The combination of probe radius and force that is chosen affects both the likelihood of probe penetration and the quality of electrical contact, which in turn affects the measurement noise and accuracy. A use test is given to aid in verifying appropriateness of a given probe for a specific layer type. Controlled lowering of the probe pins so that contact is made without lateral scrubbing of the probes against the wafer surface has been found to be very important.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.3 Microscope\n\n7.3.1 The microscope for inspecting probe damage shall have a magnification of at least $6 0 0 \\times$ , and an eyepiece magnification no greater than $1 5 \\times$ .  The microscope shall be capable of dark-field, interference contrast, or oblique illumination.  \n7.3.2 The microscope shall have a stage capable of moving the specimen in order to examine a number of adjacent damage marks made by each of the four probe points.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.4 Measurement Stage (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.4 Measurement Stage\n\nContent: 7.4.1 Wafer Prober Stage — With a vacuum chuck or comparable means of holding the wafer securely during measurement. This vacuum chuck should be of sufficient thermal mass to keep the wafer at a constant temperature, within $1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , during the time required for all measurements. The stage should be provided with stops, pins, engraved circles, or other means for accurately and repeatedly positioning wafers. For measurements on wafers where the deposited or fabricated film may extend over the edges of the substrate and make contact to the backside, a thin layer of mica, or other electrical insulator must be used between the wafer and the chuck. 7.4.2 Probe Assembly Support that allows the probes to be lowered onto the wafer surface with no evidence of lateral movement (probe skidding). This requirement can be verified by lowering and raising the probes a number of times onto a polished silicon surface with steps of 50 to $1 0 0 ~ {\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.4 Measurement Stage (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.4 Measurement Stage\n\nContent: \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ between these locations, and then observing the probe damage marks for each of the probe points with the required microscope. NOTE 5: For a probe with blunt tips or well-conditioned probe points, it is generally very difficult to view the probe damage with bright field illumination; use of dark-field, Nomarski, or oblique illumination is recommended. To aid in locating the probe damage, the formation of a grid of rectangles, by scribing, etching or other suitable process on a polished wafer surface, has been found helpful. The rectangles should be large enough to allow all four probe points to be readily located within the boundaries and a number of probe impressions to be made within the confines of a single rectangle. 7.4.3 Wafer Probe Stage with a sufficient range of motion to allow probing all desired locations on the largest wafers to be measured.

NOTE 6: If this test method is used for referee measurements, uncertainty in position coordinates may produce accurate measurements at the locations measured but may make comparison of data more difficult. It is recommended that the wafer be centered on the stage with an accuracy of $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , or better, and that all positions measured, have coordinates controlled with an accuracy of $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , or better, with respect to the center of the stage. 7.4.4 The wafer stage shall be instrumented with a temperature monitor to be used for any application where the average sheet resistance of the layer is a parameter to be reported.

Currents between ${ { 1 0 } ^ { - 6 } }$ and ${ { 1 0 } ^ { - 2 } }$ A are required if the sheet resistance range 1 to $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 \\Omega$ is to be covered. The output current must be stable to $0 . 0 1 \\%$ , or better, during the time required to take all data at each location; ripple and other noise must be less than $0 . 1 \\%$ of the dc-current level.

A standard resistor (Section 7.5.1.2) is needed to determine measurement current unless the current supply is in calibration and known to output a dc-current that is within $0 . 1 \\%$ or better of the set-point value. A wet or dry battery may be used for the current source providing there is means for regulating the output current.

However, for certain applications of interest, such as metal films and very heavily doped silicon substrates, it will generally be necessary to accept measurements with fewer significant figures or else to use a current supply with an output above the common maximum of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m A } }$ , or else to use a voltmeter with submicrovolt resolution. 7.5.1.2 Standard Resistor — Used to monitor the value of the measurement current if the current supply does not meet the accuracy of settability\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.5 Electrical Measuring Apparatus (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 7.5 Electrical Measuring Apparatus\n\nContent: given in Section 7.5.1.1. The standard resistor shall be selected to give a potential difference of 0.5 to 5 times that measured across the specimen. This requires the standard resistor to have a value from 2.5 to 25 times the sheet resistance of the layer. The value of the standard resistor must be known at least to four significant digits. 7.5.1.3 Switches — Double pole, double throw switch for reversing the direction of the current, and four pole, double throw switch for changing the probe configuration. The switching functions may be accomplished by wafer switches or relays.

If they are of the same conductivity type, a thin sheet of insulating material, such as mica, should be placed between the wafer and the stage.  This test is not necessary if the front and back surfaces are known to be of opposite conductivity type or if the layer is fully isolated from the substrate by a dielectric layer.  \n10.2 If the wafer to be measured was fabricated by a process that uses “finger” clamps or other types of clamping that intrude into the top surface area of the water, the wafer is unsuitable for use with sampling plans that require measurements within several probe spacings from the wafer perimeter.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: 11.1 Visual Inspection of Probe Impressions — This inspection should be performed when a new, rebuilt or reconditioned probe is first installed to get an initial indication of the mechanical performance of the probes. Once a probe is installed, meets the visual inspection criteria, and is left mounted, visual inspection of probe impressions is generally not needed; functional probe performance tests detailed in Section 11.2 generally suffice to qualify the probe for continued use. Further visual inspection of probe impressions is advised, however, when a probe has trouble meeting the requirements of Section 11.2.1. More routine inspection of probe impressions is also advised if probes are interchanged routinely for special applications, thus increasing the risk of changes in the alignment or rigidity of the probe mounting. 11.1.1 After selecting a probe for the intended application, make a series of at least 10 probe impressions on a polished\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: silicon surface in steps of 50 to $1 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ (0.002 to 0.005 in.). Examine the impressions from each of the pins to determine that there is no probe skidding, no cracks or fracture lines surrounding any of the impressions, and that the impressions are generally compact in nature (see Figure 3). 11.1.2 If fracture lines are seen, the probe must be replaced, or conditioned on surfaces of ceramic, sapphire, lapped silicon or other suitable, noncontaminating material until sets of impressions can be made that do not exhibit fracture. After a conditioning process, it is useful to clean the probe tips with methanol on a cotton swab to loosen debris that may have collected in the tip. 11.1.3 If probe skidding is seen, tighten or otherwise adjust the probe clamp and probe lowering mechanism to eliminate skidding. 11.1.4 If non-compact probe impressions are seen, acceptable data may result, but the probe tip(s) are generally in an\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\nContent: advanced state of wear and may not be stable with use. 11.2 Probe Performance Verification — This test must be performed before any series of referee measurements, or if a type of layer is being measured for which there is not past experience regarding proper selection of probe radius, load and conditioning. It qualifies a probe for taking highly repeatable measurements, as are needed for mapping spatial variations of sheet resistance, but does not ensure accuracy of measured value. It should be performed separately for each type of layer to be measured. 11.2.1 Select a wafer of the type to be checked for uniformity. At five different locations that are reasonably well separated on the wafer, make a series of 10 measurements following the procedure of Sections 12.4 to 12.6, 13.1, and 13.2, using steps no larger than $1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ between each of the 10 measurement positions.

For a probe to be satisfactory for use in measuring layers of this type, the standard deviation must be no more than $0 . 1 \\%$ of the average for at least four of these sets. 11.3 Qualification of Measurement Electronics — The suitability and accuracy of the measurement electronics shall be verified immediately prior to a referee measurement unless the equipment is separately demonstrated to be under statistical control for measurements of that process. For non-referee applications, use of the analog circuits is helpful for troubleshooting or performance monitoring of the electronics.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 11.3.1 Analog Test Circuit\n\n11.3.1.1 With the current supply short-circuited or turned off, attach the current leads from the analog test circuit of the appropriate resistance value to the current supply and connect the potential leads designated V (see Figure 2) from the analog circuit to the input of the voltage measuring instrumentation.

This test method makes no recommendation about choice of sampling plans, since user needs and interests are widely varied. NOTE 12: If wafer diameter scans are chosen, the probe should not be oriented so that the pins lie exactly along the diameter being scanned.

Whenever the probes are lowered or the current is changed, make sure that there is a short pause to ensure that the probes, the current supply, and the measurement voltage lines have stabilized before taking data. Depending on the wafer type and the design of the instrumentation, this may be from a fraction of a second to several seconds. 12.6.3 Measure and record the temperature of the stage to the nearest $0 . 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ at least at the beginning and the end of the measurements.

A useful technique is to plot the values obtained for $R _ { s }$ as a time sequence, that is, in the order the data for the site were taken for these sites.

For these tests, five types of wafers with average sheet resistance values from about $1 5 \\Omega$ to about $4 0 0 \\Omega$ were tested, as detailed in Related Information 1. 15.1.1 The wafers in these tests were fabricated by five different processes. The purpose of these tests is to demonstrate the consistency of determination of sheet resistance uniformity with dual-configuration fourprobe measurements, not to determine the uniformity achievable by a given process. The five processes utilized are capable of both better and poorer uniformity than seen here. 15.1.2 The repeatability of uniformity values given here represent good measurement practice, but the consistency of values for each wafer might have been even better if all measurements had been taken over a shorter time interval. 15.1.3 A standard\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 15  Precision and Bias (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 15  Precision and Bias\n\nContent: deviation, (in percent), was used to represent the uniformity values obtained for each test on each of the wafers. While it is common to give repeatability values as a standard deviation, in order to avoid confusion from duplication of terminology, the repeatability of the repeated determinations of nonuniformity for each type wafer are given in Table R1-1 as the range of standard deviation values obtained in the original tests. 15.1.4 A straightforward propagation of errors based on the performance specifications, in order to estimate the precision, does not appear possible. Required instrument resolution, power supply stability, and probe performance qualification are designed to allow a relative accuracy and precision of better than $0 . 1 \\%$ for all measurement sites on a wafer. However, for wafers with high uniformity (for example, standard deviation of all measurement site values on the order of $0 . 2 \\%$ , even these requirements may not ensure\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 15  Precision and Bias (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 15  Precision and Bias\n\nContent: good twoparty, or multilaboratory agreement on the wafer uniformity. 15.2 Bias — A statement of bias cannot be made because there are no semiconductor reference artifacts with a known level of non-uniformity.\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # 16  Keywords\n\n16.1 epitaxy; four-point probe; ion implant; metallization; polysilicon; sheet resistance; silicon\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS\n\nContent: NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1529. It was derived from information developed during the original preparation of the standard in ASTM Committee F-1 in 1994. This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures on August 16, 2004. R1-1 One wafer from each of five different thin film types was tested for uniformity. Each was $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ diameter. A measurement test-site plan using 81 test locations located at wafer center and on four equally spaced circles with a maximum radius of $3 8 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , as described in SEMI MF1618, was used for all measurements. The measure of uniformity for measurements on each wafer was the standard deviation of the 81 measured values expressed as a percent of the mean measured value. For each of the wafers, 11 to 13 tests of uniformity were run over periods that ran from 3 to 6 months, depending on the\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS\n\nContent: individual wafer. R1-1.1 Temperatures of the wafer stage were monitored and recorded. Average sheet resistances were found to change as a function of temperature but no corresponding corrections of sheet resistance values were made because the temperature coefficients of resistivity were not known for the films involved. The assumption was made that the determination of uniformity should be minimally affected as long as the temperature stayed relatively constant during the course of each measurement run. R1-1.2 Results of this test are summarized in Table R1-1. The highest temperatures used for each wafer were achieved by deliberate elevation of room temperature in order to determine whether temperature affected average sheet resistance or uniformity value. Temperature dependence of average sheet resistance was seen for wafer Types 1, 2 and 5. No dependence of sheet resistance uniformity on temperature was seen.

These tests were completed within three days. They were also associated with evaluation of the repeatability capability of the sheet resistance measurement instrumentation. For this evaluation of the instrument, 50 measurements were made on each wafer by taking 10 very closely spaced measurements in each of five relatively widely separated locations on the wafer. The assumption was made that in each group of ten, the measurements were so closely spaced compared to the sampling volume of the four-point probe that any variability experienced was a measure of the equipment repeatability (imprecision) and was not caused by variations in the thin film itself. The actual measurements of wafer uniformity used the same 81- point test pattern as used for the wafers in Section R1-1 R1-2.1 The measurements from\n\nSEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1529-1104 TEST METHOD FOR SHEET RESISTANCE UNIFORMITY EVALUATION BY IN-LINE FOUR-POINT PROBE WITH THE DUAL-CONFIGURATION PROCEDURE - # RELATED INFORMATION 1SINGLE LAB TEST RESULTS\n\nContent: this test, summarized in Table R1-2, show that for each process, the three wafers have a different average sheet resistance, even when measured at the same nominal temperature and they also have rather different levels of non-uniformity as determined from the standard deviations of the 81 measurements. The variation of these run-to-run standard deviations for a given wafer is seen to be small compared to the typical wafer-to-wafer standard deviations for the different wafers from a given process.

It does not measure the free-form shape of the wafer. 2.4 Because no chuck is used as a measurement reference, this test method is relatively insensitive to microscopic particles on the back surface of the wafer. 2.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded\n\nSEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: as the standard.

If the sample moves outside this dynamic range during either calibration or measurement, results may be in error.  An overrange signal can be used to alert the operator and measurement data examiners to this event.  \n3.3  The quantity of data points and their spacing may affect the measurement results (see Section 7.1.5.2).  \n3.4  Site flatness measurements may be affected if the site boundaries and corners do not contain data array elements. This effect may be reduced through interpolation techniques.\n\nSEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI M1 Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI M20 — Practice for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate System  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology  \n4.2  ASTM Standard 1  \nE 691 — Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.",
