Users of this standard are expressly advised that determination of any such patent rights or copyrights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, are entirely their own responsibility.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS\n\nThis test method was technically approved by the Global Assembly and Packaging Committee and is the direct responsibility of the Japanese Assembly and Packaging Committee.  Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on November 26, 2001.  Initially available at www.semi.org December 2001; to be published March 2002.  Originally published in 1993.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  Use — This test may be used for process control and outgoing inspection at the supplier or by the customer for incoming inspection.  \n1.2  Units — This standard test method uses SI units.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This method describes the standard method for measuring the thickness of silver plating on semiconductor leadframes.  \n2.2  This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 3  Referenced Standards\n\n3.1  ASTM Specifications1  \nASTM B 568 — Measurement of Coating Thickness by X-Ray Spectrometry\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 4  Significance\n\n4.1  The thickness of plating affects assembly processes such as wire bonding. If the plating is too thin, heat processes such as die attach cause the surface to become unbondable due to bleeding of the base material through the plating.  \n4.2  Schematic picture for measurement principles is shown in Figure 2.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 5  Summary of Method\n\n5.1  The method is based on the use of fluorescent Xrays. This method is chosen as the standard because of the small measurement area requirements, the high accuracy of the method for typical silver plating thicknesses used on leadframes, and the non-contact method.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 6.1  Impurities in Plating\n\n6.1.1  Elements with atomic numbers between 42 (Molybdenum) and 52 (Tellurium) cause false readings.  \n6.2  Measurement Time  \n6.2.1  At small collimator diameters, the measurement time is no longer proportional to diameter. X-ray counting errors may occur for short measurement times.  \n6.3  Worn or abraded standards will affect calibration.  \n6.4  Base material variations will affect results. Standard samples and leadframes must have the same base material and plating system conditions for accurate results.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 7  Equipment\n\n7.1  Fluorescent X-ray spectrometer.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 8  Sampling\n\n8.1  A sampling plan shall be agreed between supplier and customer.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 9  Preparation of Samples\n\n9.1  No special preparation requirements are necessary.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 10  Measurement Conditions\n\n10.1  Collimator shall be set at $0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ or $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ by agreement between user and supplier.  \n10.2  Measurement time shall be agreed between user and supplier.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 11.1  Equipment Setup\n\n11.1.1  Set up the equipment according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  \n11.1.2  Allow at least 30 minutes for equipment stabilization before beginning measurements.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 11.2  Calibration\n\n11.2.1  Calibration curves shall be generated using standard samples traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology or equivalent standards organization.  \n15.2  JIS Specifications2  \n11.2.2  Calibration curves shall be generated after the equipment has stabilized per the manufacturer’s instructions.  \n11.2.3  The equipment shall be recalibrated every 8 hours.\n\nSEMI G56-93 (Reapproved 0302) TEST METHOD FOR MEASUREMENT OF SILVER PLATING THICKNESS - # 12.1  Procedure\n\n12.1.1  Measurements shall be made close to the center of the die pad, if possible.

In leadframes, the metal burr, due to the stamping operation, may be in the horizontal or vertical direction to the surface. In ceramic packages, this type of characteristic is called a fin. 3.3 camber (ceramic) — arching o f a nominally flat ceramic body. 3.4 chip — region of material mis sing from a component (e.g., ceramic from a package, or solder from a preform). The region does not progress completely through the component and is formed after the component is manufactured. Chip size is defined by its length, width and depth from a projection of the design planform. Also called chipout.
