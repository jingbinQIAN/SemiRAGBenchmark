Permeation is often indicated by a delayed leakage indication and a continually rising apparent leakage rate. Helium tracer gas under pressure is absorbed by permeable materials, and subsequent desorption can inhibit later testing at sensitive levels. Therefore, perform the tests in this order: inboard, internal, and outboard. 3.2.2 For low pressure tests, 1 MPa (147 psig) or less, the space to be filled with tracer gas must be purged or evacuated to avoid dilution. This applies both to enclosures and to the interiors of test objects. 3.2.3 Long tubing lines or small diam eter tubing at an inlet may require purging to ensure that the tracer gas reaches the test object. 3.2.4 Conductance between the test object and the leak detector must be adequate to ensure test sensitivity. Restrictions such as regulators or check valves between the test object and the leak"

If possible, such air flow should be reduced to a minimum during testing. If testing must be performed in an area with substantial air flow, a protective film, such as is described in ASTM E 499, Method B, should be placed around the probe tip when examining each joint. 3.2.6 Temperature variations may af fect leak performance. However, this specification does not address this effect."

    "content": "Title: SEMI F5-1101 GUIDE FOR GASEOUS EFFLUENT HANDLING - # 7  Classification of Emissions\n\nContent: 7.1 The following fundamental points regarding exhaust emissions should be considered: Exhaust contaminants might be solely the material used in the process (e.g., isopropyl alcohol (IPA) from a rinse chamber) In plasma and thermal chambers many reactions occur, both those desired and others; therefore byproducts are also key components of exhaust emissions. In theory, most possible combinations of the elements in the input gases may be found as compounds in the exhaust. In practice, the main components will be the unused process gas (the percentage consumed in the process varies, and may be as low as $10 \\%$ ). Additional by-products will have different and sometimes more hazardous properties. 7.2 Considerable research has been conducted into various hazardous by-products of processes, from explosive solids to organochlorine compounds with mutagenic properties.

The division is based on three basic principles: avoiding mixing of incompatible gases in the exhaust, potential need for different end-of-pipe abatement technologies, and, keeping materials separate for recovery. 7.8 The number of separate exhaust systems used is entirely a decision for each facility, based on the following: processes and chemicals used, the number of"

However, since the gas is only held physically it can be displaced by another compound, causing the efficiency to drop significantly. A2-4.1.4 Limitations — Adsorption traps hazardous compounds and does not destroy them. Gases are adsorbed at different rates and the capacity of the bed for different gases will also vary.

These include filters (paper/bag etc.), cooled condensation chambers, cyclones, and electrostatic precipitators. A2-7.2 Removal Capacity — Removal capacity is normally measured as the mass of solid the unit can collect before it partially blocks. As they are blocked, these systems generate a backpressure, which can prevent effective removal of material or create a process disturbance.
