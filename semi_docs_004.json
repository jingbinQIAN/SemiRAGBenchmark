The Pascal is the preferred unit of pressure for use within the semiconductor industry. Units of pressure include the following: Pascal (Pa) Pounds per square inch (psi) Torr (T) Kilograms per square centimeter $( \\mathrm { k g / c m } ^ { 2 } )$ Bar (B) NOTE 1: Units of pressure are sometimes expressed as an equivalent height of a column of some liquid, such as millimeters of mercury or inches of water. These units require correction to some standard for liquid density and gravity. As these corrections are neither broadly standardized nor often even addressed, their use should be avoided. 4.1.2 absolute pressure — the pressure measured relative to zero pressure (perfect vacuum) (see Figure 1).

It is suggested that any equipment which handles wafers be tested with wafers charged to $1 8 ~ \\mathrm { { k V / i n } }$ . The charge generator used for 801-2 testing can be used to charge the wafer. Some experimentation will be required to determine the best means to carry out this test. Alternately, the handling mechanism may be challenged by air or contact discharge directed to the mechanism.  \nIt is suggested that wafer handlers be designed to dissipate charge on incoming wafers in a controlled, non-sparking manner. A simple AM radio tuned between stations and placed near the handler has been found to be a good qualitative means to detect sparking.

Also, the air discharge method is the only realistic way to test objects that are primarily fabricated from insulators, such as wet stations and keyboards.  \nIn addition to testing surfaces that come in contact with humans and wafers, it is important to test any area of the equipment that can be exposed to ESD. For instance, wet stations are composed of assemblies involving large masses of insulators in proximity to metallic sensors and controllers. It is possible for the insulating surfaces to build up charge, which then sparks to a sensor or controller — all internal to the equipment itself."

For example, a unit may be shipped, scrapped, or reworked based on information from one or more measured output characteristics.  \nA1-1.2  This appendix provides a standard methodology to include the cost due to misclassification of product because of measurement variability and bias during testing of the product for conformance to a specification.  \nA1-1.3  This appendix is also intended to be useful for pre-purchase evaluation of pieces of measurement equipment with different P/T ratios.  It is also intended to be useful when comparing the operation of a single measurement instrument in different throughput modes where P/T ratio changes with the throughput mode utilized or other equipment setup factors.  This appendix can help users select the optimum cost solution based on their specific process capability and requirements."

The use of the metric is for competitive evaluation of equipment sets to be used for a specific process step.  \n2.2  Effective use of the metric to build a COO model requires identification of the constraints, parameter values within the adopted category classification. The primary calculators should, where possible, use direct values for inputs rather than deriving them from secondary models or using the default values provided in Related Information 1 and 2 in SEMI E35.

Yield-related comparisons of equipment should be dealt with directly rather than lumping them into the CEO. 5.2.2 Particles additions for example are often used as a predictor of yield loss. Equipment should be compared directly on the basis of particles or other direct metrics such as uniformity. 5.2.3 The Cost of Equipment Ownership should only reflect Equipment Yield.

The volume requirement can be derived from specification of the product wafers or IC devices needed corrected for yield and the required number of other wafers which might be designated as test, dummy, or monitor wafers. One complication in accurately dealing with the volume requirement is that the volume of wafers actually reaching the equipment will depend on the volume loss from equipment yield for all the prior steps.  \n5.5.2  For CEOC, volume should be dealt with parametrically based upon factory wafer starts. For multi-chamber equipment, the impact of added chambers to increase capacity should be included as well as the impact of adding whole systems.  \n5.6  Good Wafer Equivalents $( G W E ) ~ - ~ \\mathrm { G W E }$ is derived from the number of good product die at wafer probe and is expressed as completely good wafers.  \n5.7  Systems Required — See SEMI E35."

Charges on an isolated conductor can be measured by transferring the charge into the coulombmeter by contacting the isolated conductor with the coulombmeter input probe. Charges on isolated conductors and insulators can be measured by transferring the charged object into a Faraday enclosure that is connected to the coulombmeter. These measurements can be relatively precise if care is taken in the transfer process to avoid changing the charge level when making the measurements. 3.2 Direct measurement of charge is often impractical. In these instances, charge is indirectly evaluated by detecting the electrostatic field from a charged surface using an electrostatic fieldmeter or an electrostatic voltmeter. 3.3 This guide does not describe in strumentation and techniques capable of making highly precise measurement of electrostatic charge.

Electrostatic fieldmeters are calibrated and recommended for use at a particular distance from the charged object. Fieldmeters are best suited for making general surveys or audits, for making measurements of surfaces at very high potentials (charge levels), and for making measurements when long-term stability is not important. They are not well suited for measurements of surfaces with very low potentials or when high spatial resolution of the surface potential is needed. 7.1.1.1 The electrostatic locator/field s ensor/field meter will henceforth be referred to as “the fieldmeter.” Note that for measurements to be taken in the presence of air ionization, a chopper stabilized fieldmeter is required.

An electrostatic voltmeter indicates the presence and approximate level of the charge(s) creating the electrostatic field. Under appropriate conditions, electrostatic voltmeters provide a better approximation of the charge level as compared to electrostatic fieldmeters. Electrostatic voltmeters are relatively free of drift and more environmentally stable as compared to fieldmeters. 7.1.2.1 Electrostatic voltmeters are we ll suited for fixed installation in equipment. Electrostatic voltmeters exhibit a high degree of accuracy that is independent of the distance from the charge.

This phenomena is known as field suppression and is illustrated in Figure R2-1. • Ionization of the surrounding air will tend to reduce the measured field strength by neutralizing the static charge on the surface of the object.

Projections and sharp protrusions on the object being measured, or nearby objects, will increase the field strength. Insulating objects may have very irregular charge distributions. As a result of these considerations, a static measurement or survey made using this standard is only useful if these factors are taken into account in a realistic manner. For example: If a surface is only used in a humidity or temperature controlled environment, field strength measurements made under these conditions are the main ones of interest. Measurements made at different humidities may be irrelevant. An object may present close to zero field in an ionized environment, yet when contacted by another object may become highly charged.

If the object is picked up and measured the field may be much higher. Objects of irregular shape and size will give highly variable readings, depending on the position of the sensor relative to the object. Dielectric objects may give highly variable readings, depending upon the position of the sensor relative to the charge distribution on the object. The simple act of handling an object while performing a static survey can change the charge on the object. The best results will derive from making sure that objects and surfaces are treated and handled within the bounds of their actual use.

    "content": "Title: SEMI E43-0301 GUIDE FOR MEASURING STATIC CHARGE ON OBJECTS AND SURFACES - # R4-1  Introduction\n\nContent: R4-1.1 Static charge generation is unavoidable whenever materials come in contact. Without a static control program, the problems caused by static charge are also unavoidable. The most common problem caused by static charge is electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD results in damaged semiconductor ICs, photomask defects, magneto-resistive (MR) read head defects in disk drives, and failures of the drive circuits for flat panel displays (FPD). ESD also creates a significant amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI). Often mistaken for software errors, EMI resulting from ESD interrupts the operation of production equipment. This is particularly true of equipment depending on highspeed microprocessors for control. Results include unscheduled downtime, increased maintenance requirements, and frequently, product scrap. Technology trends to smaller device geometries, faster operating speeds, and increased circuit density make ESD problems worse.6 R4-1.2 For many years static control programs concentrated on protecting components"

Many static control methods were devised to control the charge on people including wrist and heel straps, dissipative shoes and flooring, and garments. Increasingly, however, the production of electronic components is done by automated equipment, and personnel never come into contact with the staticsensitive devices. Solving the ESD problem means assuring that ESD events do not occur in the equipment used to manufacture and test electronic components."

    "content": "Title: SEMI E43-0301 GUIDE FOR MEASURING STATIC CHARGE ON OBJECTS AND SURFACES - # R4.2  Static Control in Equipment\n\nContent: R4-2.1 An effective static control program in equipment starts with grounding all materials that might come close to, or in contact with the static sensitive components. This prevents the generation of static charge on machine components and eliminates them as a source of the charge creating ESD events. Care must be taken in a grounding program to assure that moving equipment parts remain grounded when they are in motion. In some cases, static dissipative materials may be substituted for conductive materials where flexibility, thermal insulation, or other properties not available in conductive materials are needed. If charging of components is unavoidable, static dissipative materials may be used to slow the resulting discharges and prevent component damage. R4-2.2 Most semiconductors use insulating packaging materials such as ceramics and epoxy. Handling these insulating materials inevitably generates static charge, and this charge cannot be removed by grounding the materials. If charge generation is"

Two basic issues need to be demonstrated. First, are all components in the product-handling path connected to ground?

Discharging energy in this short time interval results in the generation of broadband electromagnetic radiation , as well as the heat that damages semiconductor components. This electromagnetic radiation, especially in the $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { M H z }$ to 2 GHz frequency range, is the EMI that can affect the operation of production equipment. In addition to ESD damage to semiconductor devices and reticles, ESDcaused EMI results in a variety of equipment operating problems including stoppages, software errors, testing and calibration inaccuracies, and mishandling causing physical component damage."
