Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on July 21, 2002.  Initially available at www.semi.org October 2002; to be published November 2002. Originally published in 1995.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 This test will determine whether or not the quantity of moisture delivered by a gaseous moisture standard is in agreement with that predicted for the standard on the basis of physical principles. It is expected that this method will be used to validate moisture standards before they are first placed in use, when deviation from expected performance is likely or suspected, and at other times as seems necessary. 1.2 The test method assumes the existence of a reliable moisture analyzer. Although extensive precautions are described to ensure the validity of the analyzer, it is always possible that the test could yield a faulty result through some unforeseen defect in the analytical equipment. 1.3 Given that moisture generation is subject to many pitfalls, it will be required that the predicted moisture concentration delivered by the standard and the measurement of that level by the analyzer be independent, and that they agree. The level of agreement can vary depending on the degree of precision claimed for the moisture\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: standard, but in any case the measured and predicted results should be within $10 \\%$ over the entire range of the moisture standard. If not, then the validation should be repeated after verifying the physical measurement upon which the prediction is based and any other parameters deemed suspect.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This method is intended to be applicable to any type of gaseous standard delivering a quantity of moisture in the ppm range or lower, provided the delivered moisture concentration is predictable on the basis of fundamental principles of physics. Thus, any standards which rely solely on characterization by analysis are specifically excluded. 2.2 As part of this test, a procedure is described for qualifying certain moisture analyzers considered suitable for use in qualifying moisture standards. Moisture analyzers intended for other applications may need to satisfy different criteria. 2.3 As the most accurate and reliable moisture analyzers currently available operate primarily in the ppm range, this test focuses on validation of moisture standards in this range. The need for ppb moisture standards is addressed by specifying procedures for reducing the output of ppm moisture standards to the ppb range. 2.4 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: users of this standard to establish appropriate safety health practices and determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  If no higher level of accuracy is specified by the user, then a moisture standard shown to be valid by this method will generate moisture levels which deviate from the expected values by no more than $20 \\%$ .  The method leaves open to the user the option of using sound statistical methods to specify that a given moisture standard will generate levels showing a closer agreement with expected values.  \n3.2  Validation based on this test method is good for a limited time. The acceptable interval between validations depends on the nature of the standard and is not addressed by this method. Thus any citation of validation results should be accompanied by the date(s) on which validation was performed.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 4  Referenced Documents\n\nThis method is based upon principles outlined in F. Mermoud, M.D. Brandt, and J.J.F. McAndrew, “Low Level Moisture Generation,” Analytical Chemistry, 63 (2): 198-202 (1991).\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 5  Device under Test (Test Specimen) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 5  Device under Test (Test Specimen)\n\nContent: 5.1 Definition of a Moisture Standard — A moisture “standard” is defined to be any device capable of delivering a flow of humidified gas at controlled pressure, with no input being provided by the user except nitrogen of UHP grade (moisture $\\leq 1 \\mathrm { p p m } ,$ ) or air of equivalent purity. Any device, such as a permeation tube, which can provide a predictable amount of moisture but does not include a means to deliver gas to and from it, will not be considered a moisture standard by itself. A device which requires gas of higher purity than UHP grade will include a purifier capable of purifying UHP nitrogen to this level. 5.2 Examples of Moisture Standards — Some examples of moisture standards and the principles upon which they are based are as follows: Permeation and effusion tube standards. These must include purification means and some means of regulating the outlet pressure. The moisture delivery rate can be calculated based on the weight loss of the tube. Cylinder standards. The\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 5  Device under Test (Test Specimen) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 5  Device under Test (Test Specimen)\n\nContent: “standard” will include a regulator specified for use with the cylinder. The moisture concentration delivered can be calculated based on that added to the cylinder in preparation. A minimum use pressure must be specified. Methods based on saturation of gas with water vapor at a fixed temperature and pressure. The moisture concentration in the gas may then be calculated from a knowledge of the saturation vapor pressure of water over a plane of the pure phase of ice at the saturation temperature and of the interaction virial coefficients of the gas-vapor mixture. The two-pressure and two-temperature methods are refinements of this approach requiring additional chambers whose temperature and pressure must be known. 5.3 Dilution of Standards — For all moisture generation methods, lower concentrations can be generated by dynamic dilution (i.e., by combining a known flow of the standard gas with a known flow of dilution gas). A diluted standard is acceptable provided: The standard is validated at high\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 5  Device under Test (Test Specimen) (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 5  Device under Test (Test Specimen)\n\nContent: concentration (with the lowest concentration validated being no more than 10,000 times the use concentration), The dilution gas has a moisture level below the stated precision of the analysis (to be verified using the same flow path as during the subsequent analysis, and at the lowest flow rate to be used), The absolute accuracies of the dilution system components are verified by comparison with a reliable flow standard, The linearity of the dilution system can be demonstrated over the entire range of operation. The last criterion is particularly important whenever some portion of the combined flow is discarded, as mixing problems can easily arise at large dilution factors.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6  Procedure\n\n6.1  Validation will be performed using a hygrometer whose output can be directly related to the moisture  \nconcentration on the basis of physical laws or using an analyzer which has recently been calibrated by comparison with such an analyzer.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification\n\nContent: 6.2.1 Primary Hygrometers — Hygrometers can be certified by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S., and similar certification is available in other countries, although the lowest concentration at which certification is available will vary. Repeated certification at yearly or longer intervals can be used to establish reliability. A hygrometer which has been certified by a national standards laboratory to $1 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ (or lower) moisture in air or nitrogen, and for which reliability has been established over a period greater than or equal to that which has elasped since certification occurred, is acceptable for validation of a moisture standard and will be referred to as a “primary” hygrometer. Because hygrometers which are suitable for use as primary hygrometers may be less convenient or less readily available than other hygrometers, the use of other hygrometers for validation is also acceptable, provided adequate precautions are taken to ensure that they are\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification\n\nContent: operating correctly. These precautions (to be described below) require using a moisture source to compare a secondary hygrometer with the primary hygrometer. The moisture source need not have been validated in this case. 6.2.2 Validation of Secondary Hygrometers Secondary hygrometers may be validated by comparing their output with a primary hygrometer when connected in parallel to the same moisture source. The degree of agreement required can vary depending upon the precision to be claimed, but in any case the difference in reading between the two hygrometers should be no more than $10 \\%$ at any point. Comparison should be made at four moisture concentrations or at two per decade of proposed operation, whichever is less. Half of the comparisons should be made while increasing concentration and half while decreasing, including at least one comparison at the highest point of the concentration range. The first and last comparisons should be at the lowest point of the concentration range. For example, in order\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification\n\nContent: to validate a hygrometer for operation between 1 and 100 ppm, it would be acceptable to generate moisture levels at 1, 30, 100, 50, 1 ppm (in that order) and compare the primary with the secondary hygrometer. Comparison of the measured level between the two 1 ppm tests provides a ready indication of hysteresis in the system. If the secondary hygrometer requires calibration using its own standard, calibration should be effected before validation. However, it is acceptable to adjust the calibration in order to improve agreement with the primary hygrometer. 6.2.3 Frequency of Hygrometer Validation — The frequency of validation required for a secondary hygrometer will vary dependent upon the performance established for hygrometers of the same general type. If three successive monthly validations show continuing agreement (within $10 \\%$ ) with the primary hygrometer without calibration adjustment, the validation interval may be extended to three months. Similar extensions of validation interval to six months\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.2  Hygrometer Qualification\n\nContent: and one year may be made if no drift is apparent and no calibration adjustments are necessary to bring the secondary within $10 \\%$ of the primary at all points.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards\n\nContent: 6.3.1 Validation Within the Range of an Available Primary Hygrometer — If a primary hygrometer is available, and its detection limit is no higher than the lowest concentration at which it is desired to use the moisture standard, this is the simplest case. Use the standard to generate four concentration levels or two per decade (whichever is less) in which the standard will be used, half of the concentrations generated while increasing concentration, half while decreasing, including at least one comparison at the highest point of the concentration range. The first and last comparisons should be at the lowest point of the concentration range. If the generated levels, calculated according to the basic properties of the generator (e.g., weight loss of a permeation tube) agree with the measured levels to within $10 \\%$ , the standard may be considered validated with an accuracy of $10 \\%$ . Higher validation accuracy requires better agreement. It has been assumed that the precision of the\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards\n\nContent: primary hygrometer, as determined by a national standards laboratory, is much better than $10 \\%$ and may be neglected for validation at the $10 \\%$ level. Validation at higher accuracy requires explicit consideration of the certification precision. If a standard only generates one level, connect it to the hygrometer and allow to come to equilibrium. Assuming the equilibrium level agrees with the calculated level of the generator, disconnect the hygrometer and bring it to equilibrium with either dry nitrogen or ambient air. Then reconnect the moisture standard and reestablish equilibrium between the standard and the hygrometer. Disconnect again and repeat a third time. If the three measurements agree within $10 \\%$ among themselves and with the generated level, the standard is validated. It is implicit in the above that the background moisture level of the system be less than 50 ppb so that it can be neglected for all measurements above $1 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ with an error no larger than\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards\n\nContent: $5 \\%$ . We can usually neglect background moisture in validating moisture standards in this concentration range. 6.3.2 Validation Using Secondary Hygrometers — If no primary hygrometer is available, then validation can be performed using a secondary hygrometer. If the lowest concentration to be generated using the standard is no higher than the detection limit of the primary hygrometer used for validation of the secondary hygrometer, then the procedure is as above, except that the secondary must first have been validated over the entire concentration range which the standard will be used to generate. (A secondary hygrometer and a moisture standard can be validated simultaneously if the primary and secondary hygrometers are connected in parallel to the moisture standard.) When assessing the accuracy of validation using a secondary hygrometer, it is necessary to take into account the precision of the comparison of the primary hygrometer with the secondary hygrometer as well as the\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 6.3  Validation Procedure for Moisture Standards\n\nContent: precision of the comparison of the generator with the secondary hygrometer.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards\n\nContent: The detection limit of the primary hygrometer will generally be on the order of $1 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ , whereas it will frequently be necessary to use the moisture standard at concentrations below this level, by a factor of as much as 10,000. Therefore, valid methods for reducing concentration are necessary. 7.1 Dilution of Validated Moisture Standards — If a moisture standard validated in accordance with Section 6.2 or Section 6.2.1 is diluted with a zero gas stream satisfying the criteria of Section 5.3, then the resultant diluted standard may be considered valid and may be used for calibration of analyzers, such as APIMS. 7.2 Consideration of Background Moisture — In any ppb or lower moisture measurement, it is necessary to consider the background moisture level due to outgassing in the sampling system and residual moisture in the generator $^ +$ analyzer. Often the background will be sufficiently large that it must be taken into account explicitly. The background moisture level is\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards\n\nContent: the moisture concentration measured in the absence of a moisture source (i.e., when the driest carrier gas available is fed to the analyzer using the same flow rate and flow path as is used for the sample gas during analysis). It should be noted that the importance of the background level increases for measurements at low concentrations, and that the background level is sensitive to the materials of construction, to the design of the moisture generator, and to its operating temperature. If the background moisture concentration is B (ppb), the concentration delivered by the moisture standard is C (ppb) and the dilution factor $x$ is given by $$ x = { \\frac { { \\mathrm { f l o w ~ o f ~ m o i s t u r e ~ s t a n d a r d } } } { \\mathrm { t o t a l ~ f l o w } } } $$ then c, the delivered moisture concentration is given (in ppb) by $$ c = ( 1 - x ) B + x C $$ The accuracy of calibration will reflect the combined accuracy of the standard and the dilution system, together with the accuracy of\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards\n\nContent: the background determination; all must be taken into account in any statement of analytical uncertainty. 7.3 Changing the Range of Performance of a Moisture Standard — If a moisture standard is based on some device which is believed to deliver moisture at a constant rate, such as a permeation or effusion tube, the concentration range delivered by the moisture standard may be changed by delivering a substantially different flow of carrier gas. This usually requires changing a mass flow controller or other flow control device inside the standard for a flow controller of a different range. This may be done provided the new flow controller' performance is verified by comparison with a reliable flow standard. The definition of dilution factor is revised to The background, B, is determined by removing the permeation or effusion tube from the system and capping off its point of connection, or by preventing the source from delivering moisture by some other means. The same equation for $c$\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards\n\nContent: applies as does the statement regarding analytical uncertainty. 7.4 Validation at Intermediate Concentrations — It may be desirable to validate a moisture standard at a concentration below the detection limit of the primary hygrometer, if that standard is to be used for very lowlevel generation. For example, if a standard based on a permeation device is intended to generate levels between 0.5 and 5 ppb at flows of 1 to $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { s l m }$ , it could be validated in the 0.5 to $5 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ range using a frostpoint hygrometer by replacing the flow controller with one operating between 1 and $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { s c c m } ^ { 1 }$ . However, such a flow controller may not be readily available and is difficult to calibrate in any case. Instead, it is preferable to use a flow controller operating between 50 and 500 sccm to generate concentrations between 0.1 and 1.0 ppm together with a secondary hygrometer having a detection limit no higher than $5 0 \\mathrm { p p b }$ . This\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards\n\nContent: procedure is acceptable, provided that the secondary hygrometer has been validated with a primary hygrometer at least at one point in the range to be used for validation of the moisture standard, the moisture concentrations generated by the standard and that observed by the secondary hygrometer agree throughout the range of validation of the standard. This approach could lead to errors if the hygrometer and the standard each exhibited a deviation from predicted performance, but these deviations would have to be the same and cancel, which is extremely unlikely. In the case of operation in this mode, it will be necessary to know the background level of the system and use this as an input to the calculation of generated moisture levels. To continue the example of a permeation based system, if the permeation rate determined by weight loss is $P$ $\\left( \\mathrm { n g / m i n } \\right)$ , the flow rate of carrier gas is $F$ (sccm), $K$ is a factor to convert $\\mathrm { { n g / m i n } }$ to\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 7  Practice for Generating ppb Moisture Standards\n\nContent: sccm moisture, and $B$ is the experimentally determined background, then the generated moisture level, $c _ { g e n }$ , is calculated according to $$ c _ { g e n } = \\frac { K P } { F } + B $$ For other moisture generation systems, it is similarly possible to calculate the generated moisture level while taking into account the background level of the system. This assumes that the background moisture concentration is constant, which is only approximately true. Thus, in applying this approach, in addition to the sources of error mentioned above, the estimate of analytical uncertainty must also include the variation in background moisture.\n\nSEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 8  Validation Precision and Accuracy (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C15-95 (Reapproved 1102) TEST METHOD FOR ppm AND ppb HUMIDITY STANDARDS - # 8  Validation Precision and Accuracy\n\nContent: This procedure does not explicitly consider the estimation of the accuracy of a moisture standard in detail, because such a calculation can be made by applying procedures described elsewhere. The accuracy required in validation will vary with the proposed application of the moisture standard and may be left to the discretion of the user of the procedure. It is recommended that a propagation of errors calculation be carried out to estimate the accuracy of the validation. If no such calculation is made, and the minimum criteria of the procedure are followed, it is estimated that a validated moisture generator may output moisture levels which differ from the true values by up to $20 \\%$ .

Filling and analytical operations e. Transport and storage conditions f. Amount of product in the container 5.1.1 The integrity of the valve is a k ey factor determining the shelf life of a gas, in particular for low vapor pressure gases. Time dependent reactions can be significantly reduced by purification of the gas to a level where impurities no longer have a significant effect over time, and by selection of proper packaging materials. Chemical and physical treatment of the internal container surface and/or passivation of this surface before filling also reduces the effect of timedependent reactions. For material and gas compatibility information, please refer to the individual SEMI gas standards. 5.2 Classification of Specialty Gas\n\nSEMI C52-0301 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS - # 5  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C52-0301 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS - # 5  Requirements\n\nContent: es on the Basis of Shelf Life — While there are a large number of specialty gases used in semiconductor manufacturing, for the purpose of defining shelf lives, they can be divided into four groups. It should be noted that for example chemically reactive gases are sometimes classified as non-reactive in the table below as the classification is done from a shelf-life point of view only. 5.2.1 Non-reactive Under normal storage conditions, these gases do not react with ambient air, the packaging materials or the impurities commonly found in the specialty gas. 5.2.2 Reactive — These gases react either with ambient air or standard packaging materials. 5.2.3 Corrosive — These gases react with packaging materials usually in the presence of traces of moisture. 5.2.4 Unstable — These gases are th ermally unstable and spontaneously decompose over time. Table 1 Classification of Specialty Gases on the Basis of Shelf Life 5.3 Guaranteed Shelf Life Period — The following guaranteed shelf life periods are recommended as a minimum. Table 2\n\nSEMI C52-0301 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS - # 5  Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C52-0301 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS - # 5  Requirements\n\nContent: Guaranteed Shelf Life Period 5.3.1 When proper packaging mater ials are chosen and the container is properly prepared (and passivated), impurity levels should in theory remain constant over time for an electronics grade specialty gas with the exception of the thermally unstable gases. For this reason, no maximum shelf life periods are recommended as these will depend on the level of analytical data collected by the manufacturer or supplier. 5.4 Mixtures — The shelf life of a mixture is recommended to be equal to the shelf life of the component in the mixture with the lowest shelf life. For example, the minimum shelf life of a reactive gas in a non-reactive gas matrix would be 24 months. The shelf life of a mixture should apply both to the impurity specifications and to the assay of the mixture. 5.4.1 Special attention should be paid to the preparation of the package for mixtures containing less than 1,000 ppm of a component. At such levels, adsorption effects may reduce the shelf life and minimization of the package internal\n\nSEMI C52-0301 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS - # 5  Requirements (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI C52-0301 SPECIFICATION FOR THE SHELF LIFE OF A SPECIALTY GAS - # 5  Requirements\n\nContent: surface roughness and/or passivation of the surface may be required. 5.5 Residual Level — The impact of the depletion of a container on impurity levels is still a matter of debate among gas suppliers. In general, the impurity levels of the first gas fraction from a container will differ from the last gas fraction. In particular moisture levels tend to rise at lower gas pressures as a result of the relative increase in importance of the internal container wall and its adsorbed moisture. In addition, in liquefied gases the co-existence of both a gas phase and a liquid phase can have a measurable effect on the distribution of impurities over the gas fractions. It is argued that at the point of liquid-dry some impurities, which prefer solution in the liquid phase over the gas phase, may see a dramatic rise. It is therefore recommended to always leave an amount of product in the container and to avoid a situation of “liquid dry” (i.e., when all of the liquid phase of a liquefied gas has been used).

Sufficient 3/8 in OD tygon tubing. Sufficient surgical rubber tubing. 1 gallon distilled water. 2 lbs technical grade ammonium chloride. 1 gallon $2 7 \\%$ ammonium hydroxide.\n\nSEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.2.2  Test Solution Preparation\n\n9.5.2.2.1  Two pounds of technical grade ammonium chloride are dissolved in one gallon of distilled water and stored in a glass jar. One-half gallon of this solution shall be combined with one-half gallon of $2 7 \\%$ ammonium hydroxide.  \n9.5.3  Equipment Assembly — The equipment is to be assembled, as per Figure 1, in a suitable wood or metal frame so arranged that the aspirator bottle connected to the burette can be raised and lowered, as required, to transfer the gas being analyzed to and from the center aspirator bottle which is filled with copper coils. The two leveling bottles should be filled half full of testing solution and the buret and aspirator bottle, which contains the copper coils, should be completely filled.\n\nSEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.4  Operating Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.4  Operating Procedure\n\nContent: 9.5.4.1 Before analyzing the sample, perform a series of analyses using a source of oxygen of which the purity has been previously determined. This procedure is necessary to age the test solution properly and eliminate any air bubbles which may become trapped in the apparatus. Only after three consecutive analyses have been run, indicating the known purity, should you proceed with testing. (See Note 8) NOTE 8: This procedure will be required only immediately after changing the test solution or contaminating the apparatus with air. 9.5.4.2 Attach rubber tubing from the regulator of the cylinder being tested to the stopcock of the burette. Rotate the stopcock so as to draw the sample into the gas measuring burette. Collect a little more than 100 mL (i.e., below the zero mark) in the burette, and then rotate the stopcock so as to shut off the oxygen flow and remove the rubber tubing attached to the intake of the burette. If the gas sample in the burette is below the zero mark raise the leveling bottle #1 so that the “water” level in\n\nSEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.4  Operating Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.4  Operating Procedure\n\nContent: the burette is exactly zero (see Figure 2a). 9.5.4.3 Rotate the stopcock to connect the aspirator bottle $\\# 3$ containing the copper coils, and transfer the oxygen into this aspirator bottle by raising the leveling bottle #1 (see Figure 2b). Invert bottle #3 containing the copper coils so that both the inlet stopper and the sided outlet are in a downward position and shake gently for 1 to 2 minutes. Stand test bottle #3 on its base and lower the leveling bottle so as to withdraw any residual gases into the gas measuring burette (see Figure 2c). Transfer at least 25 to $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of test solution from the left-hand leveling bottle $\\# 2$ into the right-hand leveling bottle #l, through the copper coil bottle #3, and the gas burette while, at the same time, gently rocking and tapping the center bottle (see Figure 2d). This will move any bubbles that might cling to the copper coil into the gas measuring burette. 9.5.4.4 Turn the stopcock off and raise the leveling bottle #l so that its liquid level is the same as the\n\nSEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.4  Operating Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.4  Operating Procedure\n\nContent: liquid level inside the upper portion of the gas burette (see Figure 2e). When the levels of the leveling bottle and the gas burette are the same, read the gas purity markings on the burette at the liquid level at this point.\n\nSEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.5  Maintenance\n\n9.5.5.1  Copper coils should be added to the test bottle as required to keep the bottles completely full. The gas burette should be kept clean with a strong detergent solution to eliminate drops of liquid that might hang up in the gas space and give incorrect purity readings. No readings should be taken when the space above the liquid level of the gas burette has any liquid drops hanging in it, as this will give an erroneous purity reading.  \n9.5.5.2  The solution must be replaced occasionally as it becomes exhausted. The necessity of replacement may be determined when the color begins to turn green, and by the increased length of shaking time required to get a minimum acceptable purity from the oxygen in a cylinder of known purity. Suspect an exhausted solution if analysis of a cylinder of known purity does not read the correct purity.\n\nSEMI C54-1103 SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR OXYGEN - # 9.5.6  Standardization\n\n9.5.6.1  The method of analysis stated above can be used as a primary standard, meaning cylinders analyzed by this method can be used as standards of measurement on electronic analyzers used to measure oxygen.  \n9.5.6.2  This method is specific to oxygen when carbon dioxide is not present in the sample gas.
