In addition TSEM-compliant equipment shall support the High-Speed Messaging Service (SEMI E37) Communication Standard sending messages over TCP/IP to maximize the amount of data available for monitoring from this class of equipment.

Parameters can be used to model any concept that can be represented as a data type.  For example, the SEMI E30 concepts of equipment constants, data variables, and status variables can all be represented by a parameter.  Any type of data that the equipment can produce (for example, measurement results on metrology equipment) can be represented by a Parameter.  Parameters can only be  \ndefined by an equipment node, an SEMI E39 ObjType, or an exception.  Parameter description is defined in Section 10.4 ."

For example, if the equipment defines several Parameters that have a structured data type consisting of an integer, a string, and an array of Booleans, this specification provides classes that can be used to describe the structure of that data type.  For numeric data types, this specification defines classes that can be used to describe the units that a value of that data type has.  For example, if some Parameter represents a capacitance in microfarads, this specification can be used to describe the microfarad unit itself, as well as how to indicate that the parameter’s value is in units of microfarads.  Parameter type description is defined in Section 10.4.11 , and units description is defined in Section 10.5.5 ."
