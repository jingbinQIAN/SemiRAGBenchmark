    "content": "3.1  Electric Immersion Heaters — Electric immersion bath heaters are resistive element heaters. The element itself is typically protected by an outer sheathing which acts as a corrosion and electrical barrier. The element is mounted to the inside of the bath.  \n3.2  External Tank Heaters — Exte rnal type heaters are normally bonded by a mastic to the outside of a chemical bath. The most common types are manufactured from a thin metal foil material that results in a very low profile configuration.  \n3.3  Heat Exchangers — The most common type of heat exchanger employs a separate heating source that may be remote from the station. This heating source can be electrically powered to generate steam or some other heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is then delivered by chemically compatible plumbing to the bath and recirculated to the heater."

The interrupt should be wired in such a manner that any signal from the liquid level sensor, overtemperature sensor, or ground fault condition should shut off power to the heaters and place the system in a “fail safe” condition. 4.3 Manual Reset — This reset sh ould be incorporated into the power interrupt device so that when the system shuts off power to the heating element, a manual reset is required to re-energize the system. 4.4 Automatic Temperature Contr oller — An automatic temperature controller maintains the liquid at a set temperature by turning the heating element on and off. The controller is activated by signals from a sensor that is located at the bath."

Special equipment and procedures may be required to perform any installation or service operation safely. No other person should install, remove, replace, clean, adjust, or otherwise alter the flow limiting device unless authorized by the cylinder owner. 3.2 Verification — When a flow limiting device is required, the user should always verify that the size is identified by tag, label or marking on the cylinder or cylinder valve exterior, and that the device size indicated matches the requirement. If a required flow limiting device is missing, the cylinder should be rejected prior to use. 3.3 Purging The addition of a flow limiting device in the cylinder valve may restrict gas flow during purging.

Verification that aerodynamic “dead spots” have been eliminated can be accomplished by use of “clean smoke” generated from a deionized water vapor generating system. 8.3.7.8 Once capture has been verified , measurements should be taken at specific openings (make-up air slots, access ports, or windows, etc.) to establish the minimum flow velocity necessary at these specific openings to achieve capture. 8.3.7.9 Record the position of covers, doors, dampers, valved openings, etc., and flow restrictions (such as fluid levels in vessels which exhaust air serves or flows through) at the time of the ventilation tests so"

The major risk is that the equipment exhaust level will be set as close to the suppliers’ specifications as possible and may not provide the safety level intended during actual equipment operation. 8.3.8 The equipment may require di fferent exhaust flow or pressure during the process cycle than in standby or maintenance modes. The supplier should provide specifications for normal operating mode demands, peak demand, and any other demand level required for employee safety.
