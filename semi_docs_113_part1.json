This sets the instrument's scale factor and other constants.  \n6.2  The wafer is supported by a small-area chuck and is scanned along a prescribed pattern by both members of an opposed pair of probes.  \n6.3  The paired displacement values are used to construct a thickness data array $( t [ x , y ] )$ .  This array represents the front surface of the wafer when the back surface of the wafer is ideally flat, as when pulled down onto and ideally clean, flat chuck.  \n6.4  The data array is used to produce one or more of the parameters required by the application.  \n6.4.1  If flatness measurements are required, a reference plane and a focal plane suitable to the application are constructed on the back or front surface.  \n6.5  Thickness or flatness, or both, values are calculated and reported, as required.\n\nSEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 7  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 7  Apparatus\n\nContent: 7.1 Measuring Equipment — consisting of waferholding device, multiple-axis transport mechanism, probe assembly with indicator, and system controller/ computer, including data processor and suitable software. 7.1.1 The measuring equipment shall have means to input the choices listed in the Procedure (see Section 12 ). 7.1.2 The measuring equipment shall be direct reading with all necessary calculations performed internally and automatically as outlined in Section 13 . 7.1.3 The system shall be equipped with an overrange signal. 7.1.4 Instrument data reporting resolution shall be 10 nm or smaller. 7.1.5 The measuring equipment contains the following subsystems: 7.1.5.1 Wafer-holding device, for example a chuck whose face is perpendicular to the measurement axis, and on which the wafer is placed for the measurement scan.

It is use of this data set that causes the reference surface to be the front surface for both the least squares and three-point reference planes. 13.3.3 Determine the point-by-point differences between the thickness and the reference or focal plane by $$ f ( x , y ) = t ( x , y ) - ( a _ { i } x + b _ { i } x + c _ { i } ) $$ where the subscript $i$ is either $R$ or $F$ depending on whether a reference or focal plane is being used and $x$ and $y$ range over the FQA, the site, or the sub-site, for global, site, or sub-site determinations. 13.3.4 Determine range (also called TIR) as\n\nSEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 13.3  Flatness Determination (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1530-1104 TEST METHOD FOR MEASURING FLATNESS, THICKNESS, AND TOTAL THICKNESS VARIATION ON SILICON WAFERS BY AUTOMATED NON-CONTACT SCANNING - # 13.3  Flatness Determination\n\nContent: follows: $$ T I R = f ( x , y ) _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } - f ( x , y ) _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } $$ where: f(x,y)max = largest (most positive) algebraic value of $f ( x , y )$ over the specified range of $x$ and $y$ , and $\\begin{array} { r l } { f ( x , y ) _ { \\operatorname* { m i n } } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ smallest (most negative) algebraic value of $f ( x , y )$ over the specified range of $x$ and $y$ .

Many metallic impurities form such recombination centers in silicon. In most cases, very small densities of these impurities (≈1010 to 1013 atoms/cm ) reduce the carrier recombination lifetime and adversely affect device and circuit performance. In some cases, such as very fast bipolar switching devices and high power devices, the recombination characteristics must be carefully controlled to obtain the desired device performance. 1.2 This test method covers a procedure for measuring carrier recombination lifetime in a variety of types of silicon wafers. Because electrical contact is not made to the wafer during the test, additional processing steps can be carried out following the test if wafer cleanness is maintained. 1.3 This test method is suitable\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: for use in research and development, process control, and materials acceptance applications. However, because the precision of this test method has not yet been established by interlaboratory test, it should be used for materials specification and acceptance only after the parties to the test have established reproducibility and correlation.\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method covers the measurement of carrier lifetime appropriate to carrier recombination processes in homogeneously doped, polished, $n -$ or $p$ -type silicon wafers with room-temperature resistivity greater than about $0 . 0 5 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ . This test method may also be applied to the measurement of carrier recombination lifetime in as-cut, lapped, or etched wafers provided that the sensitivity of the conductivity detection system is adequate. $2 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { ~ I n ~ }$ this test method, the decay of the wafer conductivity following generation of excess carriers with a light pulse is determined by monitoring the microwave reflectivity of the wafer. Since no contact is made to the specimen, this test method is nondestructive. If wafer cleanness is maintained, wafers may be further processed following testing by this test method. 2.3 Depending on the level of photoexcitation, the carrier recombination lifetime\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: determined by this test method may be the minority-carrier lifetime (low injection level) or a mixture of minority- and majoritycarrier lifetimes (intermediate and high injection levels). In the latter case, the minority and majority carrier lifetimes may be separated under some conditions if a single recombination center that follows the Shockley-Read-Hall model is assumed (see Related Information 1). 2.4 This test method is appropriate for the measurement of carrier recombination lifetimes in the range from $0 . 2 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ to $\\mathrm { > } 1 \\ \\mathrm { m s }$ . The shortest measurable lifetime values are governed by the turn-off characteristics of the light source and by the sampling frequency of the decay signal analyzer while the longest values are determined by the geometry of the test specimen and the degree of passivation of the wafer surface. With suitable passivation procedures, such as thermal oxidation or immersion in\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: a suitable solution, lifetimes as long as tens of milliseconds can be determined in polished wafers with thickness as specified in SEMI M1. NOTE 1: Carrier recombination lifetime of large bulk specimens can be determined by Method A or B of SEMI MF28. These test methods, which are also based on measurement of photoconductivity decay (PCD), require electrical contacts to the specimen. In addition, they assume large surface recombination on all surfaces and so the upper limit of measurable lifetime is governed by the size of the test specimen. Method B of SEMI MF28 stipulates that the test be carried out under conditions of low injection to ensure that the minority-carrier lifetime is determined. Minority-carrier lifetime can also be deduced from the carrier diffusion length as measured by the surface photovoltage (SPV) method in accordance with Method A or B of SEMI MF391. When carried out under low injection conditions, both the SPV method and\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: the PCD method should yield the same values of minority-carrier lifetime under certain conditions. First, it is required that carrier trapping not occur. Second, correct values of absorption coefficient and minority-carrier mobility must be used in analyzing the SPV measurements. Third, surface recombination effects must be eliminated (as in the present test method) or properly accounted for (as in SEMI MF28) in carrying out the PCD measurements. The generation lifetime, which is another transient characteristic of semiconductor materials, is typically orders of magnitude larger than the recombination lifetime. Although SEMI MF1388 covers the measurement of the generation lifetime in silicon wafers, the recombination lifetime can also be deduced from capacitance-time measurements made at temperatures above room temperature $( { \\geq } 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ using the same MOS capacitor structure. 2.5 Interpretation of measurements to\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: identify the cause or nature of impurity centers is beyond the scope of this test method. However, some aspects of deriving this information from carrier recombination lifetime measurements alone are discussed in the related information sections. Use of “injection level spectroscopy”3 is discussed in Related Information 1 and use of the temperature dependence of the carrier recombination lifetime as determined with lowinjection level4 is discussed in Related Information 2. The identity and density of impurity centers found to be present in the wafer by means of recombination lifetime measurements may usually be determined more reliably from deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements made in accordance with SEMI MF978 or from other capacitance or current transient spectroscopy techniques provided that a suitable catalog of impurity characteristics is available.5 2.6 Metallic impurities that affect the carrier recombination lifetime may\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: be introduced into the wafer during various processing steps, especially those that involve high temperatures. Analysis of procedures for detection of contamination sources (see Section 6.4) is beyond the scope of this test method. Although the test method is generally nonselective, certain individual impurity species can be identified under very restricted conditions (see Section 6.3, Related Information 1 and Related Information 2).

It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Higher mode decay of photoinjected carriers influences the shape of the decay signal, particularly in its early phases.6 These effects are minimized by measuring the decay after the higher modes have died away (beginning below $5 0 \\%$ of the maximum decay signal). 3.2 If the lifetime of the carriers is such that the carrier diffusion length is greater than 0.1 times the wafer thickness, the effects of recombination at the surfaces of the wafer must be suppressed by thermal oxidation or by immersion in a suitable electrolyte (see Section 11). 3.2.1 Treatments with electrolyte solutions must result in a stable surface for the test method to produce reliable results. 3.2.2 A further caution is in order if thermal oxidation is employed. Particularly in high oxygen wafers, oxide precipitates may form in the bulk of the wafer during oxidation. The presence of such precipitates can alter the recombination properties of the wafer (see also\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: Section 3.4) thus rendering the test specimen unsuitable for measurement by this test method. 3.2.3 Externally gettered wafers may, under some conditions, yield erroneous values of carrier recombination lifetime when measured by this test method. Results of measurements on such wafers should be checked very thoroughly for validity. 3.3 The method is not suitable for measurement of recombination lifetime in very thin films of silicon. If the thickness of the test specimen is comparable with or smaller than the inverse of the absorption coefficient of the incident radiation, the decay curve may be distorted by the spatial dependence of the generation of excess carriers. 3.4 Variations in carrier recombination properties in the direction perpendicular to the wafer surface may result in inaccurate determinations of the bulk recombination lifetime. These variations may arise because of the presence (1) of $p { - } n$ or high-low $( p \\cdot p ^\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: { + }$ or ${ n - n } ^ { + } ;$ junctions parallel with the surface or (2) of regions of dissimilar recombination characteristics (such as a wafer with oxide precipitates and a surface denuded region free of such precipitates). 3.5 The recombination characteristics of impurities in silicon are strongly temperature dependent. If comparisons between measurements are to be made (that is, before and after a process step or at a supplier and a customer), both measurements should be made at the same temperature. 3.6 Different impurity centers have different recombination characteristics. Therefore, if more than one type of recombination center is present in the wafer, the decay may consist of contributions with two or more time constants. The recombination lifetime deduced from such a decay curve may not be representative of any of the individual centers. 3.7 The recombination characteristics of an impurity center depend on the dopant type and\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: density of the wafer as well as the position of the energy level of the impurity center in the forbidden energy gap (see Related Information 3).\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 4.1  SEMI Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nContent: SEMI C28 — Specifications and Guidelines for Hydrofluoric Acid SEMI C35 — Specifications and Guideline for Nitric Acid SEMI M1 Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers SEMI M20 — Practice for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate System SEMI MF28 — Test Methods for Minority-Carrier Lifetime in Bulk Germanium and Silicon by Measurement of Photoconductive Decay SEMI MF42 — Test Methods for Conductivity Type of Extrinsic Semiconducting Materials SEMI MF84 — Test Method for Measuring Resistivity of Silicon Wafers With an In-Line Four-Point Probe SEMI MF391 — Test Methods for Minority Carrier Diffusion Length in Extrinsic Semiconductors by Measurement of Steady-State Surface Photovoltage SEMI MF533 — Test Method for Thickness and Thickness Variation of Silicon Slices SEMI MF673 — Test Methods for Measuring Resistivity of Semiconductor Slices or Sheet Resistance of Semiconductor Films with a Non-contact EddyCurrent Gage SEMI\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 4.1  SEMI Standards (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nContent: MF723 — Practice for Conversion Between Resistivity and Dopant Density for Boron-Doped, Phosphorus-Doped, and Arsenic-Doped Silicon SEMI MF978 — Test Method for Characterizing Semiconductor Deep Levels by Transient Capacitance Techniques SEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology SEMI MF1388 — Test Methods for Generation Lifetime and Generation Velocity of Silicon Material by Capacitance-Time Measurements of Metal-OxideSilicon (MOS) Capacitors SEMI MF1530 — Test Method for Flatness, Thickness, and Thickness Variation of Silicon Wafers by Automated Noncontact Scanning\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 4.2  ASTM Standard\n\nD 5127 — Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in the Electronics and Semiconductor Industry7\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 4.3  DIN Standard\n\nDIN 50 440 Part 1 — Measurement of Carrier Lifetime in Silicon Single Crystals: Carrier Recombination Lifetime at Low Injection by Photoconductivity Decay  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: 5.1.1 injection level — the ratio of the density of excess carriers generated by photons or other means to the equilibrium density of majority carriers in an extrinsic semiconductor crystal or wafer. 5.1.2 recombination lifetime — the average time interval between the generation and recombination of hole-electron pairs in a homogeneous semiconductor. 5.1.2.1 Discussion — In the Shockley-Read-Hall model, which applies for a small density of recombination centers, the recombination lifetime for centers with energy levels that are not too close to a band edge is the minority-carrier capture time constant provided that the density of excess carriers is very small compared with the density of majority carriers (low injection).

The specimen surface is conditioned in such a way that surface recombination has a negligible effect on the decay of the conductivity following cessation of the light pulse. This decay is monitored by means of microwave reflectance, and the carrier recombination lifetime is determined as the time constant of the appropriate portion of the exponential conductivity decay. 6.2 A narrow-beam light source may be used so that measurements may be made repeatedly at different localized points on the wafer to obtain a map of the distribution of carrier recombination lifetime. 6.3 The measurement may be repeated at several different values of\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 6  Summary of Test Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\nContent: specific parameters, such as injection level (light source intensity) or temperature in order to obtain more detailed information about the nature of the recombination centers. 6.4 A process step that acts as a contamination source can sometimes be identified by comparing measurements of carrier recombination lifetime made before and after the step.\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 7  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # 7  Apparatus\n\nContent: 7.1 Pulsed Light Source — A laser diode with wavelength between 0.9 and $1 . 1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .

In addition, Blakemore goes on to discuss other complexities that result when the density of defect centers is not small compared with the majority carrier density,17 and when carrier trapping occurs.18 R1-3 Both the assumptions underlying the S-R-H model are generally appropriate for the specimens to be measured by this test method. With these assumptions, the density of excess electrons $( n _ { e } )$ is equal to the density of excess holes $( p _ { e } )$ , and the electron $( \\tau _ { n } )$ and hole $( \\tau _ { p } )$ lifetimes for recombination through a defect center located at an energy $\\varepsilon _ { T }$ within the forbidden energy gap are equal.

It involves either (a) the capture of an electron in an empty defect center followed by the capture of a hole or $( b )$ the capture of a hole on a filled defect center followed by the capture of an electron. Thus, the recombination time depends on the number of filled or empty defect centers as well as the capture time constants. R3-2 The occupancy of the defect centres is controlled by the position of the Fermi energy as discussed by Blakemore.16 If all of the defect centers are empty, the electron recombination time is\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME\n\nContent: governed by the electron capture time constant, $\\tau _ { n O }$ ; this occurs when the Fermi energy is well below the defect center energy. If all of the defect centers are filled, the hole recombination time is governed by the hole capture time constant, $\\tau _ { p 0 }$ ; this occurs when the Fermi energy is well above the defect energy. Since the position of the Fermi energy is governed primarily by the dopant density, the occupancy of the defect centers may be different for different resistivity wafers. R3-3 There are two sets of equivalent cases. The defect center may be in the same half of the forbidden gap as the Fermi energy or it may be in the other half. Thus, the case for the defect center in the lower half of the gap of a $p$ -type semiconductor is the same as for the defect center in the upper half of the gap in an $n$ -type semiconductor with the roles of electrons and holes\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME\n\nContent: interchanged. Similarly, the case for the defect center in the upper half of the gap in a $p$ -type semiconductor is the same as for the defect center in the lower half of the gap in an $n$ -type semiconductor. R3-4 As examples, consider the three cases of elemental iron in both n- and $p$ -type silicon and ironboron pairs in $p$ -type silicon at room temperature (300 K). In each case the iron density is assumed to be $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } \\mathrm { a t o m s } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ . Note that at for very low resistivity wafers, the nondegeneracy requirement of the S-R-H model may be violated. R3-4.1 Elemental Iron in $p$ -Type Silicon (see Figure R3-1) — For all practical values of resistivity, the Fermi energy lies many $k T$ below the near mid-gap energy of the elemental iron center. Consequently, the defect centers are empty and the limiting process is capture of excess minority\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME\n\nContent: electrons, there being ample numbers of holes present to recombine with the electron immediately upon its capture by the defect center. Therefore, the small-signal carrier recombination lifetime is equal to the electron (minority-carrier) capture time constant: $\\tau _ { 0 } = \\tau _ { n 0 }$ . R3-4.2 Elemental Iron in $n$ -type Silicon (see Figure R3-2) — In this case, for all values of resistivity, the Fermi energy is very far above the defect center energy and all the defect centers are filled, and hole capture is governed by the hole capture time constant, $\\tau _ { p 0 }$ . Because the Fermi energy is close to the conduction band edge, there are large numbers of electrons present so that as soon as a hole is captured, the defect center is filled again. Therefore, hole capture is the limiting process, and the small-signal carrier recombination lifetime is equal to the hole\n\nSEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1535-1104 TEST METHOD FOR CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME IN SILICON WAFERS BY NON-CONTACT MEASUREMENT OF PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY DECAY BY MICROWAVE REFLECTANCE - # RELATED INFORMATION 3 MINORITY-CARRIER RECOMBINATION LIFETIME\n\nContent: (minority-carrier) capture time constant: τ0 = τp0. R3-4.3 Iron-Boron Pairs in $p$ -Type (Boron-Doped) Silicon (see Figure R3-3) — This defect center is located quite close to the valence band edge. For all but very low resistivity wafers, the Fermi energy lies above the defect center energy so that some of the defect centers are filled. In this case, the capture of minority electrons is still the limiting process, but since only a fraction of the sites can capture an electron, the smallsignal recombination lifetime is larger than the electron capture time constant. Quantitatively, because $n _ { 0 } < < p _ { 0 }$ , the small-signal carrier recombination lifetime is given by $\\tau _ { 0 } = \\tau _ { n 0 } ( p _ { 1 } / p _ { 0 } )$ . R3-4.4 The fourth possible case is one in which the defect center is located near valence band edge in $n$ - type material.

R3-5 Thus, for deep lying defect centers, the lowinjection (small-signal) carrier recombination lifetime is equal to the minority-carrier capture time constant (or minority-carrier lifetime), while for centers close to the band edge, the small-signal carrier recombination lifetime can be much larger than the minority-carrier capture time constant.

NOTE 1: The accurate measurement of sputter crater depths on the order of and below $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ is still an area of research, because the sputtered silicon is very reactive to oxygen in the air when removed from the SIMS chamber for crater depth measurement. For example, sputter craters expected to be only $1 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ in depth can actually be thicker than the original native oxide due to this rapid oxide growth on sputtered silicon, that is, one observes a bump on the surface where the erosion was, rather than a crater.

Last previous edition SEMI MF1618-02.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: 1.1 The fabrication of semiconductor, dielectric, and metal thin films is a critical part of silicon integrated circuit production. The variation of film properties across the surface of a wafer can have significant impact on the further processing of the wafer and on the ultimate yield of acceptable chips from the wafer, as well as on their reliability. 1.2 The purpose of this practice is to promote commonality of approach to the analysis of uniformity among all parties needing to generate or assess such information, including manufacturers of the basic test instrumentation to be used. 1.3 This practice is intended for process control, research and development, and process equipment evaluation purposes. It is intended for the benefit of semiconductor device and equipment manufacturers alike so that acquisition, reduction, and communication of thin film data is consistent among various parties who may need to concur on interpretation of the results of a thin film fabrication-process step. 1.4 Measurement of the\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: uniformity of one or more thin film properties such as thickness, sheet resistance, reflectivity, dielectric constant or index of refraction enables the monitoring of a critical aspect of the results of a given process step. This information can be used to determine the behavior of individual process steps; it can be used with similar information from earlier process steps to determine their interaction with respect to final product uniformity. Also, it can be used in conjunction with historical data from the same process step to determine loss of control of the piece of equipment or the process cycle being used with respect to producing product having a required level of uniformity. Further, it can be used to determine the adequacy of new or modified process cycles, materials or equipment for a given film deposition or film modification requirement. 1.4.1 It is common practice to monitor the value of a simple statistic, such as the standard deviation, that results from layer uniformity measurement data and to\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: compare the current value of the statistic with historical values for the same layer formation process. An increase of the current value over historical values is taken as an indication of possible deterioration of the quality of the layer formation process. It is then common to convert the data into a contour or similar map of uniformity to aid in diagnosing changes in the process that caused the increase in standard deviation (or similar statistic). This practice does not treat the interpretation of the statistic resulting from data analysis, nor does it give procedures for converting the data to a uniformity map. 1.5 The non-uniformities of a film property on a given wafer are primarily systematic, not random, in their spatial shape or distribution and arise from spatially systematic variations in such process variables as temperature, gas flow, pressure, or electric field. As a result, the simple statistic standard deviation that is specified for analysis of data acquired with this practice will not generally\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: have the normal interpretation for the standard deviation of a sample from a random population. It is a figure of merit for comparing data sets of a similar type, but it cannot be used for computing confidence or tolerance intervals.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This practice covers a set of site distribution patterns for measuring the uniformity of a property of a thin film on a silicon wafer, as well as simple procedures for analyzing and reporting the results of those measurements. 2.2 This practice is intended for use as a template for the evaluation of the uniformity of intrinsic film properties such as thickness or composition, and also film functional characteristics such as sheet resistance and reflectivity. The resulting information may be used to assess the uniformity of the film itself or of the layer formation process. This practice is not directly applicable to evaluating wafer-to-wafer or lot-to-lot variations. 2.3 This practice is intended for use with any thin film or layer type, or formation technique, for which basic measurement instrumentation and capability exists that, is appropriate to the film parameter of interest. This practice is intended for layer growth and deposition techniques such as epitaxy, implantation, thermal and chemical vapor\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: deposition (CVD) oxidation, and metallization, as well as for layer modification such as various means of layer etching. 2.4 This practice is intended for use with all silicon wafer sizes and types when measuring uniformity of film properties and characteristics. This practice describes measurement site patterns and determination of their spatial coordinates on the wafer, as well as the statistics to be used when reducing the measurement data to determine uniformity. For each of the sampling plans, the exact number of measurement sites is chosen based on the size of the wafer being used, the desired spatial resolution of the measurement instrument, and whether maximal, or somewhat lesser information density is desired. However, in all such choices, the pattern of measurement sites, the rules for selecting their coordinates on the wafer, and the statistical calculations of the results should remain consistent with the procedures of this practice. 2.5 This practice can be used with any measurement method, procedure\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: or instrumentation that can measure the needed film property or characteristic with sufficient precision and spatial resolution to reveal the needed information on spatial non-uniformity of the film. This practice does not itself contain details on performing any specific measurement. 2.5.1 Not all types of measurements that may need to be used for evaluation of the uniformity of a thin film have formal procedural standards. SEMI MF374, SEMI MF576, SEMI MF1392, SEMI MF1393, and SEMI MF1529 give details of measurement procedures that may be applied to evaluating the uniformity of thin film properties. 2.5.2 This practice does not deal with acquisition or analysis of uniformity data where it is desired to take more than one measurement per specified spatial cell such as is commonly done for wafer site flatness measurements. 2.6 This practice makes no recommendations regarding the interpretation of the statistics that result from analysis of the data acquired with regard to the goodness or badness of given values of\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: the test statistic, nor does it make recommendations regarding decisions about the process cycle or equipment used to produce the thin film that was measured. 2.7 The principles of this practice may be adapted to determine the uniformity of bulk silicon wafer properties such as interstitial oxygen content and resistivity, but depending on the desired property and the chosen measurement technique, depth-dependent variations may be misinterpreted as lateral variations. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 This practice is written for evaluation of planar or blanket films, but it may be applied to patterned films if the pattern size, shape, and distribution do not interfere with the spatial resolution of the selected measurement technique and the specified measurement site selection. If either of these interferences occur, the user may adapt the principles of the method to the needed application, but the interpretation of the results may change. 3.2 The principles of this practice may be adapted to other semiconductor wafers, such as gallium arsenide, but particular concerns with those other materials may not be addressed adequately in this practice. 3.3 Uniformity measurements from certain types of measurements may be misinterpreted if the user is not aware of the full nature of the basic measurement being made. For example, sheet resistance is a function both of the inherent resistivity of the film being measured and of its thickness value. Non-uniformity in sheet resistance values across the wafer may\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: result from nonuniformity in resistivity (layer composition or structure) or layer thickness (deposition rate) alone, or it may result from simultaneous variations of both parameters. 3.4 Changes in test equipment performance, or changes in test procedure or conditions over time may detrimentally affect the ability to compare test results from this practice over time for a given film property or fabrication step. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the measurement system and process remains in sufficient control to allow time-wise comparison of uniformity results, if such comparisons are needed. 3.5 Sampling area or sampling spot-size may cause misinterpretation of the cause of thin film nonuniformity if the magnitude of the non-uniformity and its spatial scale, or rate of variation is not well matched to the sampling spot size and the selected distribution of measurement sites. While this should not be a serious concern for most modern film deposition processes, and process equipments, which\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: are operating in control, the principles of this limitation are worth elaborating. 3.5.1 If the sampling area or the spot size of the test instrument is large compared to rates of film parameter change (gradients) that are important to identify, it must be recognized that such large sampling area instruments generate some form of spatial average response that may understate macroscopic film non-uniformity or fail to respond to microscopic film non-uniformities or both. 3.5.2 If the sampling area or spot size is small, it is generally possible to quantify the full scale of macroscopic film non-uniformities. However, should spatial fine-scale systematic film variations be present, they may affect the individual measurements in an inconsistent manner unless the measurement sampling plan is tailored to the spatial size scale of the fine variations. Such tailoring of the sampling plan is generally incompatible with the requirements of this practice. 3.6 For the most meaningful interpretation of uniformity data,\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: all sampling sites should represent equal wafer areas, and the available area of the wafer should be fully sampled. The existence of wafer flats causes a failure of the first requirement with all concentric circle sampling plans. The need of the semiconductor industry to establish as large a quality area as possible on wafers also causes a failure of the first requirement for the outermost circle of concentric circle sampling plans because of the need to measure right up to a very small edge exclusion value. The second requirement is not met near the perimeter of Cartesian sampling plans. 3.7 Ideally, measurements would be made at the specified sites in a random sequence so that instrument drift or changes in other environmental parameters that may affect measurement results would have a random correlation with measurement positions. It is normally not practical to acquire data in this fashion. Therefore, any instrumental or environmental change that may occur will have a correlation with the spatial ordering\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: of the measurement sequence. While such changes are expected to have about the same effect on both concentric circle and Cartesian sampling plan measurements, providing the number of data points are about the same, they would nevertheless have different effects on two-dimensional contour maps that resulted from these two different types of sampling plans. 3.8 Individual test instruments and test methods that may be used to measure properties or characteristics of thin films are subject to various interferences that may affect measurement precision consistency, resolution, and accuracy. These may include such things as sensitivity to stray illumination, rf-fields, and variations in temperature. It is the responsibility of the user of this practice to consult instrument manuals and appropriate test methods in order to identify and control potential interferences with that instrument or method. 3.8.1 It is also the responsibility of the user to devise a test for the inherent precision of the measurement being\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: made so that imprecision in the measurement is not misinterpreted as non-uniformity of the thin film being evaluated by this practice. This is particularly important for application of this practice to evaluating films from process steps that are capable of a very high degree of uniformity, for example, $1 \\%$ across a wafer. Such tests may involve using known uniform or nonuniform test specimens whose spatial pattern of nonuniformity has been found to be very stable over extended periods of time.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nContent: SEMI M1 Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers SEMI M20 — Practice for Establishing a Wafer Coordinate System SEMI MF81 — Test Method for Measuring Radial Resistivity Variation on Silicon Wafers SEMI MF374 — Test Method for Sheet Resistance of Silicon Epitaxial, Diffused, Polysilicon, and IonImplanted Layers Using an In-Line Four-Point Probe with the Single-Configuration Procedure SEMI MF576 — Test Method for Measurement of Insulator Thickness and Refractive Index on Silicon Substrates by Ellipsometry SEMI MF673 — Test Methods for Measuring Resistivity of Semiconductor Slices or Sheet Resistance of Semiconductor Films with a Non-contact EddyCurrent Gage SEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology SEMI MF1392 — Test Method for Determining Net Carrier Density Profiles in Silicon Wafers by Capacitance-Voltage Measurements with a Mercury Probe SEMI MF1393 — Test Method for Determining Net Carrier Density in Silicon Wafers by Miller Feedback Profiler Measurements with a Mercury Probe\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nContent: SEMI MF1529 — Test Method for Sheet Resistance Uniformity Evaluation by In-line Four-point Probe with the Dual-configuration Procedure NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions. 5 Terminology 5.1 Definitions of terms used in this practice may be found in SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 6  Summary of Practice\n\n6.1  Measurements are made at the sites specified in the chosen sampling plan using the appropriate instrumentation and measurement procedure for the film parameter of interest.

NOTE 1: It is generally advisable, through use of a time series plot of the original data, or similar means, to inspect the data just rejected for determination of measurement site location and relation to adjacent measurement values.

However, when there is a systematic spatial behavior to the measured values, the standard deviation may not be used to estimate confidence intervals or tolerance limits. 9.3 Calculate the following two statistics from the complete data set or from the reduced data set if certain measurements were rejected in Section 9.2. These two statistics represent the range and the distribution of data about the mean. The use of only one of these statistics is at the discretion of the interested parties. 9.3.1 High-Low Variation, $H L V ,$ , in percent: $$ H L V ( \\% ) = \\frac { x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } - x _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } } { x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } + x _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } } \\times 2 0 0 $$ 9.3.2 Standard Deviation Uniformity, $S U P$ , in percent: $$ S U P ( \\% ) = \\frac { s } { \\overline { { x } } } { \\times } 1 0 0 \\ $$ NOTE 3: The Appendix1 of SEMI MF81 gives, for the case of sparse site sampling plans, an example of the propagation of error from the basic\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 9  Calculations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 9  Calculations\n\nContent: measurement technique to the determination of variation of material properties using that technique.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 10  Report (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 10  Report\n\nContent: 10.1 Report the following information when describing the uniformity of a specific thin film parameter across the surface of a wafer: 10.1.1 Wafer identification and diameter, 10.1.2 Operator and date, 10.1.3 Substrate type (orientation and doping, if appropriate), 10.1.4 Generic film type, and reactor, run or process information, as appropriate, 10.1.5 Film parameter measured and assumed material constants used for analysis, 10.1.6 Sampling plan used, 10.1.7 Test method used by designation, if available, or by brief description if no standard procedure is available, 10.1.8 Test instrument manufacturer, model, options, 10.1.9 Total number of points measured; number of points within 3-sigma; number of points used to calculate $H L V$ and $S U P$ , 10.1.10 Calculated $H L V ( \\% )$ , $S U P ( \\% )$ , mean value $( { \\overline { { x } } } )$ , and sample standard deviation, $s$ . 10.2 Two-dimensional contour plot, data histogram, or time series plot of measurement values may be included if agreed upon between the\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 10  Report (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 10  Report\n\nContent: parties to the test. 10.3 For a single-diameter sampling plan, also report the angle between the diameter measured and the fiducial axis.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 11  Precision and Bias\n\n11.1  Precision — The precision with which wafer uniformity can be measured is governed by the precision of the individual test method being used.  \n11.2  Bias — The bias associated with the wafer uniformity measurements is also governed by the bias of the individual test method being used.  \n11.3  The Precision and Bias sections of the test method being used should be consulted.  \n11.4  The standard deviation and range calculations that are specified in Section 9 are descriptive statistics or figures of merit for describing the uniformity of the thin film wafer in a simple and consistent manner, but they are generally not appropriate for determining the precision of the measurements.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # 12  Keywords\n\n12.1  dielectric layers; epitaxial layers; ion implant; metal films; sampling plans; semiconductor; silicon; thin films; uniformity\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # APPENDIX 1 SAMPLING PLANS TO BE USED FOR WAFER UNIFORMITY DETERMINATION\n\nNOTICE: The material in this appendix is an official part of SEMI MF1618 and was approved by full letter ballot procedures.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-1 Introduction (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-1 Introduction\n\nContent: A1-1.1 For all plans, measurements are made within a circular area defined by the radius, $R _ { o }$ , between the center of the wafer and the circle on which the centers of the outermost measurement sites lie. Determine this radius by either of the following methods: A1-1.1.1 Method $A - \\operatorname { I n }$ this method, the outermost edges of the measurement spots on the outermost radius are tangent to the boundary of the fixed quality area (FQA) as defined in SEMI M1: $$ R _ { o } = \\left( \\frac { D } { 2 } - ( E E + \\frac { d } { 2 } ) \\right) $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l } { R _ { o } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ radius of the outermost measurement circle (see Figure A1-1), $\\begin{array} { r l } { D } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ nominal diameter of the wafer, for example, 100, 150, 200, or $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , EE $\\mathbf { \\tau } = \\mathbf { \\tau }$ nominal wafer edge exclusion, which determines the FQA, and $\\begin{array} { r l } { d } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ known or estimated diameter of\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-1 Introduction (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-1 Introduction\n\nContent: the measurement spot for the test instrument being used (Note 1). A1-2.2 The location of every point in a multipoint measurement pattern depends on the method chosen to define the position of the outermost measurement sites. Therefore, there may be differences between the two methods for reported individual and statistical values. A1-2.3 Data for a measurement site are usually reported at the location corresponding with the center of the measurement spot. A1-2.4 Data from each measurement on the outermost ring in Method A are not affected by the film properties in the edge exclusion annulus outside the FQA. However, in this case, data are not reported for locations closer to the boundary of the FQA than the measurement spot radius. A1-2.5 Conversely, data from each measurement on the outermost ring with Method B include contributions from film properties both inside and outside the FQA. In this case, measurement data is reported for locations up to the boundary of the FQA, but establishing the significance\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-1 Introduction (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-1 Introduction\n\nContent: of including data influenced by film properties outside the FQA is outside the scope of this practice. NOTE 1: The exact diameter of the measurement spot may not be known for many types of measurements. Estimate the diameter as 1.5 times the probe spacing for a four-point probe, transducer radius for an eddy-current instrument, and apparent beam spot radius for optical measurements if no other information is available. A1-1.1.2 Method $B$ — In this method, the centers of the measurement spots on the outermost radius are on the boundary of the fixed quality area (FQA) as defined in SEMI M1: NOTE 2: Measurements obtained using a probe whose effective measurement area extends beyond the edge of the film inaccurately represent actual film properties. $$ R _ { o } = \\left( { \\frac { D } { 2 } } \\right) - E E $$ where the symbols are defined following Equation A1- 1.\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-2 Selection of Method\n\nA1-2.1 Neither of these methods is “better” than the other; rather, there are tradeoffs.  \nFigure A1-1 FQA Boundary and Outermost Ring Radii, $\\scriptstyle R _ { o }$ , for Methods A and B\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2 (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2\n\nContent: A1-3.1 The concentric circle plans are designed so that each measurement location samples approximately an equal area of the specimen surface. Because these are circular plans on a circular wafer, ideally they give equal representation to all portions of the wafer’s surface. This approximation to equal-area sampling breaks down for the outermost circle if the size of the edge exclusion is less then half the radial separation between the inner circles for the spacing being used. In this case, the measurements on the outer circle represent a smaller area of silicon than do the measurements on the inner circles. Moreover, if the actual sampling area of the measurement being used is larger than the value estimated in Section A1-1.1.1, measurements on the outer circle may be partially influenced by thin film properties in the excluded region even though the resulting values are attributed to the fixed quality area of the film. A1-3.2 The concentric circle sampling plans utilize a measurement at the\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2 (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2\n\nContent: wafer center and points on a number of concentric circles designated $1 , 2 , 3 , \\ldots n$ , the number of circles being chosen by the user according to wafer diameter, estimated sampling area for the measurement being made, and the amount of information desired about the uniformity of the thin film. A1-3.2.1 On each circle, the measurements are separated by equal angular intervals. Eight measurements are made on the first circle, 16 are made on the second circle, etc. In general, the number of measurements is eight times the circle number. For the first circle, measurements are separated by rotations of $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ , for the second circle, by $2 2 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ , and so forth, regardless of the radial value of the measurement or the wafer diameter. A1-3.2.2 The radial values for the concentric circles are determined as follows. Inspect Table A1-1 for the number of total measurements that are made as a function of the number of circles used and decide on the number of circles\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2 (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2\n\nContent: according to the amount of information needed for the film uniformity and the time required for the test instrument to take that many measurements. Call the chosen number of circles, $N _ { C }$ . Divide the value of the outermost radius, $R _ { o }$ , determined in Section A1-1.1, by $N _ { C }$ . This gives the radial increment between the circles. The center of the measurement tool or measurement spot is to be placed at the location given by this radial increment value. Figure A1-2 illustrates measurement locations for threecircle and four-circle sampling plans. NOTE 3: If the incursion of the orientation flat(s) precludes taking valid measurements near the flat in conjunction with the chosen edge exclusion, the parties to the test may choose to exclude specified measurement locations if the test instrument permits or to replace specified sites with sites at a distance from the flat that is equal to the distance specified with respect to the circular perimeter of the wafer. It must be\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2 (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2\n\nContent: remembered, however, that either such choice may have an adverse impact on the interpretation of any two-dimensional contour map. Table A1-1 Number of Measurement Sites for Various Numbers of Concentric Circles A1-3.2.3 For consistency, place the wafer on the instrument stage with the primary flat, or notch, facing the operator. If another convention becomes necessary, so note it on the report. Measurements are made starting at the center of the wafer then proceeding around the first, then the second, then the third circle, and so forth. For all circles, make sure that the first measurement is made at the same angular orientation; the positive $x$ -axis or the positive $y$ -axis, as defined in the wafer coordinate system specified in SEMI M20, is recommended. The choice should have no bearing on the data or its analysis. However, if data is to be presented as a time-series plot, note on the plot the position of the first point on each circle as well as whether the measurements proceed in a\n\nSEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2 (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1618-1104 PRACTICE FOR DETERMINATION OF UNIFORMITY OF THIN FILMS ON SILICON WAFERS - # A1-3 Concentric Circle Plans2\n\nContent: clockwise or counterclockwise fashion on the wafer surface.

They may not provide sufficient information about the outermost portion of the fixed quality area for a given application. See Figure A1-3 for an illustration in the case of a 37- point Cartesian sampling plan. A1-4.2 These plans have a grid of equal-sized cells, equally spaced about the center of the wafer. A measurement is made in the center of each cell. The number of rows and columns in the grid, always an odd number, is chosen according to wafer diameter, estimated sampling area for the measurement being made, and the amount of information desired about the uniformity of the thin film. The square cells in this plan are not necessarily the shape or size of the sampling area for the measurement being used. In general, make sure that the sampling area for the measurement is smaller than the dimensions of the square.
