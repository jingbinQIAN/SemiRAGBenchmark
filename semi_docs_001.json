The specification has two classifications: General Usage and Auto Transport Usage. General Usage is a basic guideline that covers 3 inch, $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ , $1 2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ wafer sizes. Auto Transport Usage is intended to meet the in-use requirements for the interface of wafer carriers with automated wafer processing equipment. Auto Transport Usage covers the $1 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ sizes. 1.2 To meet these specifications, carriers must be manufactured within the dimensional limits and be dimensionally stable within the specification when used in accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations. 1.3 This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated"

These general requirements assist in the compatibility of wafer carriers and most automated wafer processing equipment. Wafer pre-orientation is recommended before transferring wafers into quartz carriers to avoid interference between the flat fiducial(s) and carrier slots. These standards are intended to promote the interchangeability of wafer carriers and encourage the production of equipment suitable to a greater percentage of the market. 1.2 The design definitions of SEMI Wafer Carrier Specifications assume compliance to wafer dimensions defined in SEMI M1, M3, or M9. For a wafer carrier to be said to “meet the SEMI specifications,” it must be manufactured within the dimensional limits of the given specification, and in addition be dimensionally stable within specification when used in accordance with manufacturer' s recommendations. Since wafer carriers are manufactured from a"

The equipment states are determined by functional issues, independent of who performs the function. The measurement of equipment reliability in this specification concentrates on the relationship of equipment failures to equipment usage, rather than the relationship of failures to total elapsed time. 2.2 Section 5 (Equipment States) defines how equipment time is categorized. Section 6 (RAM Measurement) defines formulas for measurement of equipment performance. Section 7 (Uncertainty Measurement) gives additional methods for evaluating the statistical significance of calculated performance metrics. 2.3 Effective application of this specification requires that equipment performance (RAM) be tracked with regard to time and/or equipment cycles.

Any part failure, software or process recipe problem, facility or utility supply malfunction, or human error could cause the failure. NOTE 1: It is important to categorize and qualify failures in ways that facilitate the resolution of problems and improve overall equipment performance. Use of this specification requires agreement between supplier and user on categorizing failures. 4.1.7 equipment-related failure — any unplanned event that changes the equipment to a condition where it cannot perform its intended function solely caused"

Any given maintenance procedure, for example, is classified the same way no matter who performs it, an operator, a production technician, a maintenance technician, or a process engineer. 5.3 Figure 1 is a stack chart of the six basic equipment states. These basic equipment states can be divided into as many sub-states as are required to achieve the equipment tracking resolution that a manufacturing operation desires. SEMI E10 makes no attempt to list all possible sub-states, but does give some examples for guidance. 5.4 Key blocks of time associated with the basic states and example substates are given in Figure 2. These blocks of time are used in the RAM equations given later in this document. The blocks of time associated with"
