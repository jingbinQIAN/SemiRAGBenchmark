R2-1.2 The EPT state of the IMM as a whole is based on three components: the state of the STPO, the state of the portion of the IMM that is independent of the STPO (representing loading and unloading of substrates) and the combined state of any IMM Data Table Object (representing either current measurement (raw data) or calibration) or data conversion activities. The IMMC does not require the IMM-only (exclusive of STPO and IMM Data Table Object states) to have a state model representing any other activities that it may be performing, but to correctly calculate the EPT state as a whole, its own EPT states must be done.

The IMM-only, then, will be either: • actively performing some task, with or without material, with no faults (EPT-BUSY), inactive, without material, and with no reason that would prevent it from performing any of its normal tasks (EPT-IDLE), or inactive, either with material present or because of a fault in one of its subsystems (EPT-BLOCKED).
