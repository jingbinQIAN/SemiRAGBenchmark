The following general principles are integral to the ergonomics design and evaluation of equipment:  \n1.2.1  The equipment should be designed to optimize safety by distributing tasks. Tasks should be distributed among hardware, software, and users to make the best use of their respective capabilities and to minimize limitations and hazards. Appropriate distribution of tasks will also optimize performance.  \n1.2.2  Equipment should be designed to minimize potential for errors and mishaps, by conforming to users expectations.  \n1.2.3  The equipment design should reduce fatigue and injury by fitting the equipment to the expected body size, strength, and range of motion characteristics of the user population. Such design will also facilitate task performance."

Human factors design criteria are sometimes based on studies using few subjects or are context-specific. Ergonomics experts should be consulted where data development or interpretation is required. 3.3 The equipment design should incorporate reasonable accommodations for users with special needs, such as lefthandedness and color blindness. Where feasible the design should also accommodate users with hearing or vision impairments and/or physical disabilities. It should be understood that although designing for the target user population will accommodate some users with special needs, these guidelines cannot anticipate and fully accommodate all such users. 3.4 Existing models and subsystems that meet"

R2-2.6 FMEA — Failure Modes, Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a tabulation of the system/plant equipment, failure modes, and each failure mode' s effect on th system/plant equipment. The failure mode is a description of how equipment fails (e.g., open, closed, on, off, leaks). The effect of the failure mode is the system response or accident resulting from the equipment failure. FMEA identifies single failure modes that either directly result in or contribute significantly to an important accident. Human/operator errors are generally not examined in FMEA, although the effects of a mis-operation are usually described by an equipment failure mode. FMEA is not efficient for identifying combinations of equipment failures that lead"

A checklist, suited for the equipment to evaluate, may be used. R2-2.8 Event Tree Analysis — Event tree analysis is a technique for evaluating potential accident outcomes resulting from a specific equipment failure or human error known as an initiating event. Event tree analysis considers operator response or safety system response to the initiating event in determining the potential accident outcomes. The results of the event tree analysis are accident sequences, a chronological set of failures or errors that define an accident. These results describe the possible accident outcomes"

Event tree analysis is well suited for operations that have safety systems or emergency procedures in place to respond to specific initiating events. NOTE R2-1: This technique is also known as Fault Hazard Analysis. R2-2.9 Fault Tree Analysis — Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) focuses on one particular accident event and provides a method for determining causes of that accident event. The fault tree itself is a graphic model that displays the various combinations of equipment faults and failures that can result in the accident event. The solution of the fault tree is a list of the sets of equipment failures that are sufficient to result in the accident event of interest. The strength of FTA as a qualitative tool is its ability to break down an accident into basic failures."
