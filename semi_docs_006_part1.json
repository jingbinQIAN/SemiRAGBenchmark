Required directional changes should be accomplished by butt-weld elbows or block components. Tube bends may be used on tubing $\\leq \\%$ inch O.D. and should be formed using manual or CNC bending equipment. CNC tube bending is preferred to manual tube bending because during manual bending uniform deformation of the tubing is more difficult to control and reproducibility of bend geometries is much less than that achieved by bending using CNC methods. An internal mandrel must not be used during bending as it can contaminate and/or damage the internal surface. Recommended minimum bend radii are the following: For inert gas lines, a bend radius (as measured from the tube centerline) as small as $2 \\ \\times$ tube diameter may be used for 90 degree directional changes.

The system internal volume should be minimized. 5.5 All potentially pyrophoric or reactive gases should have upstream and downstream purge/vacuum capability for MFC maintenance. To speed the purge process and allow the system to be evacuated even if the MFC is clogged, the design should also have the ability to provide vacuum both upstream and downstream of the MFC.

Inert gases can act as their own purge gas and only need to purge in the intended direction of flow. Inert gas lines do not need upstream vacuum capability or downstream purge capability. To speed the purge process, the design should have the ability to provide vacuum downstream of the MFC. 5.7 For low pressure equipment, the vacuum path from the MFC manifold to the pump should bypass the process chamber during purging or maintenance and should connect directly to the foreline. 5.8 For atmospheric pressure equipment, a vacuum Venturi to vent/exhaust method should be required for reactive gases. 5.9 Design should include a means of cycle purging upstream and downstream of removable components or subassemblies for reactive gases and should include a means of flow-through purging for all removable components. 5.10 Backflow/back pressure protection should be included for all purge gases in the system. 5.11 All incoming gas lines should have filters.\n\nSEMI E49.8-1103 GUIDE FOR HIGH PURITY AND ULTRAHIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 5  Design Guidelines (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI E49.8-1103 GUIDE FOR HIGH PURITY AND ULTRAHIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT - # 5  Design Guidelines\n\nContent: 5.12 Any additional filters, located at point of use before a process chamber or loadlock, should have a means of isolation from atmosphere. 5.13 Test/sample ports should be located on each process chamber supply line or the designated purge/vent line. 5.14 For processes requiring additional purification of process gases, purifiers should be included in the gas system and located upstream of MFC’s.

In no instance should the accuracy rating of the measuring equipment be less than twice that of the DUT (e.g., if the accuracy of the DUT is $\\pm \\nobreakspace 1 \\nobreakspace$ sccm, then the accuracy of the measuring device must be better than or equal to $\\pm 1 / 2$ sccm). The traceability of all the pertinent measuring instruments and devices should be realistically established and quantified. 7.1.1 In addition, take care when using test instruments with a specified accuracy expressed in percent of full scale. For example, if an instrument with a specified accuracy of $\\pm 0 . 1 \\%$ of full scale is used to measure the output of the DUT, but this output signal falls only within the lower third of the scale of the instrument, the effective accuracy over the range of the instrument being used may be $\\pm \\ :\n\nSEMI E56-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACCURACY, LINEARITY, REPEATABILITY, SHORT-TERM REPRODUCIBILITY, HYSTERESIS, AND DEADBAND OF THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 7  Interferences (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E56-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACCURACY, LINEARITY, REPEATABILITY, SHORT-TERM REPRODUCIBILITY, HYSTERESIS, AND DEADBAND OF THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 7  Interferences\n\nContent: 0 . 3 \\%$ , which is unsuitable for many applications. 7.2 Use special precautions to ensure that minimum effects result from pneumatic noise in flow lines. Monitor pressure both upstream and downstream of the MFC to ensure that pneumatic noise is minimized. 7.3 The DUT should be installed so that the inlet flow can be fully developed, pulsation-free, for the specific conditions. This can be achieved by plumbing a straight length of tubing 40–50 diameters long upstream and another straight length 5 diameters long downstream of the DUT. (For additional information about inlet effects, refer to ASME MFC-10M.) 7.4 At regular calibration intervals, verify electrical signals directly at the MFC connector to ensure that there are no unacceptable line losses in the cables.\n\nSEMI E56-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACCURACY, LINEARITY, REPEATABILITY, SHORT-TERM REPRODUCIBILITY, HYSTERESIS, AND DEADBAND OF THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 8  Apparatus\n\n8.1  heat exchanger\n8.2  flow standard\n8.3  pressure transducer\n8.4  back pressure regulator\n8.5  temperature probe\n8.6  digital voltmeter\n8.7  setpoint generator\n8.8  power supply\n\nSEMI E56-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACCURACY, LINEARITY, REPEATABILITY, SHORT-TERM REPRODUCIBILITY, HYSTERESIS, AND DEADBAND OF THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 9  Technical Precautions\n\n9.1  Many analog-to-digital converter cards do not differentiate between measurements of less than zero and zero.

Apply power to the MFC for the 24 hours prior to initiating warm-up as defined by the manufacturer.  The valve should be in its “off” position (closed for a NC valve, open for a NO valve).  \n12.2  Following the conditioning period, install and warm up the device according to manufacturer's specifications.  \n12.3  Purge the MFC with clean, dry nitrogen or argon following the warm up period.  \n12.4  Allow the test gas to flow through the DUT for a minimum of 10 minutes at $100 \\%$ of flow.  \n12.5  Apply a $100 \\%$ full-scale setpoint to the DUT and wait for the flow to stabilize for 10 seconds.  Apply the lower setpoint limit to the DUT and wait for the flow to stabilize for 10 seconds.  Repeat this cycle two more times.

For those instances when a range of values is specified rather than a reference value, the midpoint of the range shall be taken to be the reference value.  \n12.7.2  The reference power supply must be sufficiently rated for the DUT.  In addition, the following supply conditions and tolerances shall apply:\n\nSEMI E56-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACCURACY, LINEARITY, REPEATABILITY, SHORT-TERM REPRODUCIBILITY, HYSTERESIS, AND DEADBAND OF THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI E56-1104 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING ACCURACY, LINEARITY, REPEATABILITY, SHORT-TERM REPRODUCIBILITY, HYSTERESIS, AND DEADBAND OF THERMAL MASS FLOW CONTROLLERS - # 13  Procedure\n\nContent: Table 1 Data Tabulation 13.1 Zero Offset — Close the gas shut-off valve upstream of the DUT and apply a $100 \\%$ setpoint to the DUT to equilibrate the pressure across the MFC. Wait for the flow to stabilize at a value near zero; then close the downstream shut-off valve. Deactivate the MFC’s control valve (open for (NO) valves, closed for (NC) valves), and allow the MFC to auto-zero if the an autozero option is available. After the electrical output signal has stabilized for at least three minutes, record the MFC zero offset in Table 1.

As shown in Figure 1 and defined in Table 1, each pin is radially symmetric about the vertical center axis line and can be seen as the intersection of a cylinder of diameter $d 9 1$ and a sphere of radius $r 9 3$ (which might contact a flat plate). An additional rounding radius $r 9 5$ provides contact with angled mating surfaces, and blend radii $r 9 4$ and $r 9 6$ smooth the resulting edges. The final roughness height of the over-all surface finish must be less than or equal to $r 9 7$ . Dimensions $r 9 2$ and $z 9 1$ have zero tolerance because they only give a distance to another toleranced dimension.

As shown in Figure 2, the outer pin in each set is designated the primary pin for use on a tool load-port or vehicle nest or inside a box, and the inner pin in each set is designated the secondary pin for use on a robotic arm that would pick up the carrier (typically from the side opposite the load face plane). The location of each pin is determined with respect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in $\\ S 4$ : the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and the bilateral datum plane. Figure 3 shows the locations of the kinematic coupling pins as viewed from above, and Table 2 defines the locations (all of which are bilaterally symmetric about the bilateral datum plane). Angle θ is shown in Figure 3 for clarity and is not part of the requirements in this standard. 5.3 Empirical Determination of Datum Plane Locations — Given a set of three primary or secondary kinematic\n\nSEMI E57-0600 (Reapproved 0305) MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR KINEMATIC COUPLINGS USED TO ALIGN AND SUPPORT 300 mm WAFER CARRIERS - # 5  Requirements (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI E57-0600 (Reapproved 0305) MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR KINEMATIC COUPLINGS USED TO ALIGN AND SUPPORT 300 mm WAFER CARRIERS - # 5  Requirements\n\nContent: coupling pins, the datum planes should be determined as follows. The two pins that are closest together are the front pins which (along with a known vertical direction) define a Cartesian coordinate system. The center axis line of each pin is defined to be the vertical line whose $x$ (left-right) coordinate is the average of the maximum protrusions of the pin to the left and to the right and whose $y$ (front-back) coordinate is the average of the maximum protrusions of the pin to the front and to the back. The bilateral datum plane is defined to be the vertical plane that contains the center axis line of the rear pin and that is equally distant from the center axis lines of the front pins. The facial datum plane is defined to be the vertical plane that is perpendicular to the bilateral datum plane and whose distance to the center axis line of the rear pin is 1.5 times the average of the distances to the center axis lines of the front pins.

This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures. R1-1 The three features on the bottom of the wafer carrier that mate with the six pins underneath are not specified in this standard. These three features are recommended to be inverted V-shaped grooves, each of which extends along a line that is perpendicular to, and co-planar with, the nominal wafer center line (as shown in Figure R1-1). Such grooves are likely to work well even when shrunken or slightly misaligned (such as when they do not all line up with the nominal wafer center line). Other mating features are also possible, such as those shown in Figure R1-2 where one pin is contacted on the top. Front-opening boxes may need to contact the pins on the side to provide pressure against a front mechanical interface. Such options are why the top and sides of the pins are toleranced so\n\nSEMI E57-0600 (Reapproved 0305) MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR KINEMATIC COUPLINGS USED TO ALIGN AND SUPPORT 300 mm WAFER CARRIERS - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 APPLICATION NOTES (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E57-0600 (Reapproved 0305) MECHANICAL SPECIFICATION FOR KINEMATIC COUPLINGS USED TO ALIGN AND SUPPORT 300 mm WAFER CARRIERS - # RELATED INFORMATION 1 APPLICATION NOTES\n\nContent: tightly.

Most of the dimensions of the interface from the box to the tool load port are determined with respect to the three orthogonal datum planes defined in that standard: the horizontal datum plane, the facial datum plane, and the bilateral datum plane. However, the dimensions in this standard do not apply when the box is placed on the load port, but rather when the box has been moved horizontally into place against the front-opening interface. Otherwise, the frontopening interface would interfere with the kinematic coupling during loading, and the minimum rear clearance in E15 would be violated. 5.2 Symmetry — All of the dimensions for the interface are bilaterally symmetric about the bilateral datum plane and about a plane $z 3 0$ above the horizontal datum plane with the following\n\nSEMI E62-0705 PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm FRONT-OPENING INTERFACE MECHANICAL STANDARD (FIMS) - # 5  Requirements (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI E62-0705 PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION FOR 300 mm FRONT-OPENING INTERFACE MECHANICAL STANDARD (FIMS) - # 5  Requirements\n\nContent: exceptions (as viewed by a person standing in front of the tool and facing the interface): • The registration pins are in the lower right and upper left quadrants of the port door.

The over-all surface finish of the registration pins must have a final roughness height less than or equal to $r 4 7$ . The registration pins are surrounded by reserved space for optional vacuum application. 5.4 Locking Mechanism — The box door is locked and unlocked by a set of two $1 3 . 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ by $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ heads on shafts that have a $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter.

The latch keys must not rotate beyond these limits of the rotation angle $\\psi$ . To allow seal compression by latches, the torque delivered by the port to turn the latch keys must be at least $f 3 0$ . Thus, it is recommended that no box door be designed that needs more torque than this. Figure 3 shows front, side and top views of the latch keys. In addition, convex features on the outer edges of the latch keys (adjacent to the surface defined by $y 3 6$ ) must have a blend radius of $r 4 1$ to prevent small contact patches with large stresses that might cause wear and particles. Other convex features on the latch keys need only be de-burred and rounded off.

Similarly, the frame seal zone must be on the frame of the port door in the area between $x 3 4$ and $x 3 5$ from the facial datum plane and between $z 3 4$ and $z 3 5$ from the vertical center line of the port. The door and its frame must be designed to mate with a front-opening box that conforms to SEMI E47.1. Specifically, the port door and its frame must have surfaces that mate with the seal zones and the reserved spaces for vacuum application (which includes all of the circles bounded by $r 3 8$ except for the holes for the registration pins at the center of each circle).
