Current edition approved by the Japanese Regional Standards Committee on November 20, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004.  \nE This document was modified in May 2004 with committee approval to correct an error made at the preballot stage.  Changes were made to Figure R1-2.\n\nSEMI F94-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS (EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.5 INCH FOUR FASTENER CONFIGURATION TYPE SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  This standard establishes the properties and physical of two port components for 1.5 inch type surface mount gas distribution systems.\n\nSEMI F94-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS (EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.5 INCH FOUR FASTENER CONFIGURATION TYPE SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This document includes common requirements, layout, size, detailed specifications, and dimensions of the components.  \n2.2  This standard applies to all two port four fastener components (except mass flow controllers and mass flow meters).  The components (i.e. valves, pressure regulators, pressure transducers, filters and purifiers) are mounted on substrates with fasteners accessible from the top.  \n2.3  This standard only applies to components, which control flow of $\\leq 5 0$ slm nitrogen equivalent at $3 0 8 ~ \\mathrm { { k P a } }$ (44.7 psia).  This standard also only applies to components with operating pressures less than 3445 kPa (500 psia) at $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI F94-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS (EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.5 INCH FOUR FASTENER CONFIGURATION TYPE SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  This standard only addresses the component; it does not address the seals, the sealing system, or the assembly process and does not guarantee the performance of the sealing system.  The user should be aware that gas delivery system performance and sealing system performance are addressed elsewhere in the SEMI standards.  \n3.2  The user should be aware that alternative technologies are commercially available.  \n3.3  International, national, and local codes, regulations, and laws should be consulted to ensure that the equipment meets regulatory requirements in each location of use.\n\nSEMI F94-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS (EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.5 INCH FOUR FASTENER CONFIGURATION TYPE SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI E49.9 — Guide for Ultrahigh Purity Gas Distribution Systems in Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment  \nSEMI F20 — Specification for 316L Stainless Steel Bar, Extruded Shapes, Plate, and Investment Castings for Components Used in High Purity Semiconductor Manufacturing Applications  \n4.2  ASME Standards1  \nASME Y14.5 — Dimensioning and Tolerancing  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI F94-0304 SPECIFICATION FOR DIMENSION OF TWO PORT COMPONENTS (EXCEPT MFC/MFM) FOR 1.5 INCH FOUR FASTENER CONFIGURATION TYPE SURFACE MOUNT GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS - # 5.1  Definitions\n\n5.1.1  components for surface mount a gas distribution system component having inlets and outlets located on the bottom of the component with the attachment mechanism accessible from the top.  \n5.1.2  four fastener configuration — the component has four fasteners located on an interface, independent of number of sealing point.  \n$5 . 1 . 3 R a$ — roughness average.
