These axis directions are arbitrary. 5.2.3 It should be noted that if fully automated prober set-up modes are not used for probe-needle-to-pad alignment during testing, the possibility of operator error should be considered as a variable when evaluating system accuracy. 5.3 automatic wafer prober dev ice that automatically and repeatedly aligns the die bonding pads or interconnect bumps on a semiconductor device to a set of test needles attached to a probe card. 5.4 bonding pad — exposed metal lic contact area on a semiconductor device that is surrounded by dielectric passivation.

Thus, repeatability simply represents the three-sigma distribution value for average die offset. Repeatability will represent $9 9 . 7 \\%$ or a three-sigma distribution value for the accumulated offset data points obtained through use of this method. 5.14.1 The X-Y plotted centroids of t hese scrub marks will be found to form a “cloud” of points, densest in the center, and thinning out towards the edges. 5.14.2 Repeatability is the radius of th at cloud or “cluster” of probe marks, as defined by the $3 \\sigma$ or other user defined limit of that cloud. The error in the placement of the center of that cloud, relative to its nominal target, is defined as the automatic wafer prober’s “Accuracy”.

That task force consisted of members from semiconductor wafer probe system users and wafer probe system suppliers. This method, in part a guide to collection of data, is aimed at a specific set of wafer probe system parameters: accuracy, repeatability and throughput. This method is a tool that creates comparative data. That data will act as a criterion by which multiple wafer probe systems can be judged competitively. 6.2 Probe System Accuracy and Throughput – A wafer probe system will have needle placement error due to the probe system electromechanical systems, and additional needle placement error due to the probe card physical alignment of the needles. The degree of accuracy to which the probe system can place the chuck, the effectiveness of the probe system's bond pad to needle alignment, the physical alignment of the probe card needles in their $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ and $\\mathrm { \\Delta Y }$ plane,\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: and the probe system's vision resolution and accuracy (x microns of distance per pixel) will be the factors that influence a probe system's overall placement performance. 6.2.1 Probe system comparative acc uracy and repeatability are established in this method using probe mark data acquired manually with a vision system or, if available, through use of an automated probe mark data analysis system. Acquired data is analyzed with the Probe Mark Data Analysis algorithm contained in this method. 6.2.1.1 The intention of this data colle ction exercise is not to make a deterministic conclusion establishing a probe system’s accuracy. Data analysis results are only meaningful in the context of a comparative analysis of multiple probe systems. 6.2.2 Probe system throughput is be st determined using time measurements made using a stopwatch. Other approaches can be applied, such as: the time stamp and log file (if available) on the probe system under evaluation. time tracking within the device\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: test program employed for testing the prober. 6.2.3 Any of these approaches is via ble for measuring time intervals during probe system operation. That data is to be entered into the data collection table as part of the application of this method. 6.2.4 The algorithm collects data fro m 9 wafers out of a lot of 10. Three setups are performed using 3 wafers per setup. All dice will be probed, but data will be taken only on twelve of the die on each wafer. Twenty-four pads on each die are evaluated (see Figure 4). Overall, 2592 die pads are analyzed in a lot. 6.2.5 When all the data is collected and analyzed, each probe system will have an average die offset value. This will be a comparative representation of accuracy consisting of average offsets for all evaluated die. This comparative representation of accuracy is a measure of how accurate the probe systems place the chuck, and thus the probe needles, to the center point on the die pads, consistent with normal operation of the probe\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: systems. 6.2.6 In general, when the probe ma rks are viewed across all dice, there will be a data spread, or distribution of error points for each wafer. Repeatability is the $\\pm \\nobreakspace 3 \\sigma \\nobreakspace$ variation of all die offsets, identified in this method as the 3σ calculation of Normalized Die Offset. 6.3 Probe Card Issues – Probe car d construction variability and probe card usage at temperatures other than ambient are important considerations. The following sources of error should be kept in mind: In a hot chuck environment the probe card and needles will experience a high percentage of the elevated chuck temperature. The material selection for the probe card will determine how it expands and contracts due to the temperatures applied. Probe systems can be equipped with programmable preheat (soak) times. Longer preheat times will reduce probe card variability while decreasing throughput. Needle construction can result in excessive error due to bending of the\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: needles when excessive probe system z-stage overdrive is applied. The number of needles and the selection of needle technology, i.e., cantilever versus vertical, is another variable, having a noticeable influence on measurement results. Since each user of this method is not confined to a standard for probe card construction, the user of this method is advised to choose a probe card and vendor with good integrity, and to use that same probe card when evaluating multiple probe systems. The assertion here is that the same probe card used to evaluate multiple systems will react in a repeatable manner under varying environmental conditions. This assumes there is no excessive probe card needle wear during the multiple evaluations, and that needle alignment is verified or achieved before each execution of the procedure. 6.3.1 Probe mark scrub length can v ary due to several factors including: variations in the flatness of the chuck and stage travel that are not compensated by the zsensor\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: mapping algorithms by hard spots in the aluminum pads, or by variations in probe tip geometry, etc. 6.3.2 To minimize the impact of this variation in the probe mark analysis algorithm, use only scrub mark location data that is taken normal to the direction of scrub. Distances measured normal to the orientation of the scrub mark are generally accepted to be significantly more stable than that which is taken parallel to the scrub mark (see Figure 2). 6.3.3 In summary, the probe card itself can be a limiting factor when making needle placement accuracy measurements, especially at varying environmental conditions. Material selection, vendor to vendor variation, construction of a probe card (blade, epoxy ring, vertical, etc.), especially with varying environmental conditions, will create inconsistent analysis results, unless care is taken with the application of this method. The precautions discussed here are meant to promote consistent and accurate evaluation results for this method.\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: 6.3.4 Nevertheless, the precautions mentioned here could ALSO be an important basis for using this method. As an example, a probe card is typically designed for XY positional placement and planarity, and is expected to meet customer specification requirements in normal operation at room temperatures. This method could serve as a means of establishing numerical results that represents the effects that temperature or probe card construction variability have on probe card specification requirements. 6.4 The PMA Algorithm – A best-f it rectangle can be drawn around the scrub mark and the passivation opening for each pad, reference Figure 3. NOTE: Applying a best-fit rectangle around the passivation opening may prove difficult for certain vision systems. Application of the best-fit rectangle around the die pad metal is an acceptable alternative. The center position of the best-fit rectangle around the scrub mark will represent the center of the scrub mark. The center of the die pad is the\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: center of the best—fit rectangle around the passivation opening. The distance between the two centers is the pad offset. Pad offset is computed from the four values left, right, top, and bottom, reference Figure 2. 6.4.1 Vision system measurements will be made establishing offset distances from the die pad center to the scrub mark. The stability of the measurement is greater when made perpendicular to the direction of the scrub mark. This will establish $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ and $\\mathrm { Y }$ offsets via measurement of offsets for pads in the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ and Y plane of the die. 6.4.2 Once the offsets are establishe d, a two-step procedure will manipulate $1 2 9 6 \\mathrm { ~ X ~ }$ and $1 2 9 6 \\mathrm { ~ Y ~ }$ offset values. The end result of the algorithm will be a relative measure of the total probe system accuracy and repeatability for the pads analyzed. Figure 5 represents a visual summary of the method. 6.5 Considerations of Scale — When evaluating the\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: suitability of a particular probe system to probe a particular size of bond pad, or to probe accurately at a particular pad-to-pad pitch, a good rule of thumb is that the prober’s positional accuracy, as stated in its specifications, should be 1/10 that of the scale of the features to be probed. For example, if the probe system being evaluated has an overall placement accuracy of ${ 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , it would be inappropriate to analyze wafers using this method and this probe system for dice that have pads less than $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ square (this would be less than 10x). 6.5.1 Regardless, when this method is used for evaluation of multiple systems, it is essential that die and bond pad size/pitch consistency be maintained from evaluation to evaluation if the results are to be meaningful. Passivation opening and best fit rectangle 6.5.2 The same $1 0 \\times$ rule applies to t he vision system or automated Probe Mark Analysis system employed to make the pad offset\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # 6  Summary of Method\n\nContent: measurements. These systems should have a pixel resolution that is at least $1 0 \\times$ finer than the die pad dimensions associated with the scrub marks being measured. 6.6 Conclusion — It is assumed th at the user of this method has a wafer probe system or systems, or is planning to make a selection from the various systems available in the market place, and requires objective comparative analysis for accuracy, repeatability and throughput. 6.6.1 It should be clear that this met hod employs a three-step process of probing, probe mark data collection, and data analysis. 6.6.2 When probing, every die on ea ch of the ten wafers is to be “tested” and probed. Of those ten wafers, the last nine with 12 die per wafer will be used for scrub mark data collection. At least 24 pads per die will be used for the analysis. The first wafer is meant only to allow stabilization for the probe system and its probe card.\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection\n\nContent: 6.6.3 It is important that the wafers u sed with this method are probed only once, or else multiple scrub marks may be difficult for the measurement system to deal with and will most likely influence the analysis results. This method assumes the wafer is ideal, having no die skew due to wafer process anomalies. NOTE: It is possible that a not so perfect probe tip to pad alignment (PTTPA) may create misleading results for this method. It is recommended that PTTPA be done on die located at the edge of the wafer, as shown in Figure 4. This is opposed to having PTTPA done on die in the center of the wafer. An offset error incurred in the context of a PTTPA done in the center may result in an incremental and continuing error as testing moves across the wafer. With this method that error may be averaged-out. 6.6.4 Probe system index time is dev ice and probe system dependent. Probe system index time is determined by acceleration, maximum achievable\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection\n\nContent: velocity, and distance traveled die to die by the chuck. Thus, the device type chosen for use with this method should be representative of typical die size if meaningful index time and throughput data are to be gathered. 6.6.5 If the results of this method tu rn out to be unfavorable, the user has the option of applying a more detailed, enhanced data analysis application of this method. That application is contained in Appendix 1. The enhanced method uses the same data, but it requires more manipulation of the data during data analysis. The detail contained in the enhanced algorithm will provide the user with greater insight as to the cause of unfavorable results related to the probe system under evaluation. A summary of the enhanced method is shown in Figure 6. 6.7 Alternatives — What has been left undefined to this point is availability of an automated approach to data collection per the requirements of this method. Regardless, data collection\n\nSEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G78-0699 TEST METHOD FOR COMPARING AUTOMATED WAFER PROBE SYSTEMS UTILIZING PROCESS-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS - # Recommended Dice and Pads to be used for Data Collection\n\nContent: can be manually accomplished. The manual process is laborious and requires a video measuring system to make offset measurements on the die pads, and a spreadsheet to analyze the resulting data. 6.7.1 If manual operation is not desi rable or practical, automated Probe Mark Analysis Systems do exist in the market place as an item to be purchased. Providers are also available to accept probed wafers and execute probe mark analysis under contract as a service. NOTE: A Final Note to the User of This Method — This method provides sufficient data for sophisticated analysis of probe system performance across die-to-die, wafer-to-wafer, and setup-to-setup. It also provides a simple metric. It is easy to make comparisons with simple \"single number\" metrics, but that has the potential for oversight, distortion and subsequent inappropriate comparisons.

The X and Y graphs are usually about $9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ out of phase. A1-1.3.1.2 Other qualitative information c an also be gathered by visually looking at the graphs of this data. One can determine whether the accuracy is varying wafer to wafer (each set of 12 data points is a wafer) or set-up to setup (each set of 36 data points is a set-up) or just drifting over time. Drift over time is sometimes caused by temperature stabilization issues within the prober mechanism. Subsequent steps will quantify how much variability is caused by each.

In this equation, we subtract the average die offset (presumed prober error) from each pad in that die. This data is then used for the next step.

All $1 2 9 6 { \\mathrm { ~ x } }$ -direction and 1296 y-direction pads of Normalized (by die) Pad Offset will be used to calculate a $3 \\sigma$ variation which is called Pad-to-Pad variation (P-P-X and P-P-Y). A1-1.5.2 Discussion of P-P-X or P-P-Y (Pad-to-Pad Variation in the X-direction or Pad-to-Pad-Variation in the Ydirection) A1-1.5.2.1 These values describe how mu ch variability there is within all the pads in the lot. This value is frequently attributed to probe tip variation in X, Y, and Z. Although probe tips do change and wear over time, their unloaded position usually does not change dramatically within one lot. This value does not help tremendously in describing prober accuracy nor should it be used for any sort of probecard metrology.

NOTE 2: A verification procedure to complement this Overall Digital Timing Accuracy Specification is currently being developed as a SEMI draft document. 6.2 Explanation of Figure 1 — Th is figure is meant to graphically describe Overall Timing Accuracy and its constituent components. Overall Timing Accuracy (OTA) is made up of three components, and by definition is the aggregate timing error comprised of input edge placement accuracy (see Section 7.1.1), output edge placement accuracy (see Section 7.1.2), and input to output timing accuracy (see Section 7.1.3). It’s important to note that the OTA specification and associated graphical representation shown in Figure 1 is meant to encompass timing delay errors across multiple machines, as well as multiple calibrations for a single machine over time. 6.2.1 Our experience in dealing with multiple-pin automated test systems reveals that not all input drive circuits can place a drive edge at exactly the same point in time relative to a common reference. The same is true\n\nSEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 6  Test Methods (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 6  Test Methods\n\nContent: for output compare circuits when placing compare edges. Thus, these edges tend to have an (error) distribution around some average value relative to their intended placement. This is due in part to the inherent anomalies associated with electronic circuits that makeup these edge placement elements. The distribution of edge error is graphically shown for input (see Section 7.1.1) and output edge (see Section 7.1.2) signals in Figure 1. 6.2.2 Drive Input to Compare Outpu t Timing Accuracy (Section 7.1.3) can be described in different ways. It is easy to think of this parameter, per the definition given in this document, Section 7.1.3, as simply the relative time difference (skew) between the drive delay timing error distribution and the compare delay timing error distribution for a particular machine. But this parameter, once established for a machine, is not necessarily constant. For example, this parameter can change from one calibration of a machine at a particular time, to something different, as a result of a subsequent\n\nSEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 6  Test Methods (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 6  Test Methods\n\nContent: calibration of that same machine. As well, this parameter can also be considered as a machine to machine accuracy parameter, not necessarily having the same value between any two machines of the same kind. 6.2.3 Thus, on each machine and at different points in time for the same machine the Drive Input to Compare Output Timing skew can be uniquely different per machine. That difference being influenced by the various machine anomalies that contribute to machine error including the not so perfect results of a periodic edge calibration. 6.2.4 Examination of the OTA defin ition in the context of Figure 1, that being the general case and not a single point timing evaluation, reveals that the overall timing accuracy time value is the time line indicated by “A” and the time line indicated by “B”. In a single point AC timing evaluation, OTA is determined as a distribution of edges associated with time line “A” or time line “B”, depending upon the relationship between the drive edge values and compare edge values (see Section 7.1.3) at that\n\nSEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 6  Test Methods (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 6  Test Methods\n\nContent: point in time.\n\nSEMI G79-0200 SPECIFICATION FOR OVERALL DIGITAL TIMING ACCURACY - # 7  Definitions\n\n7.1  Overall Timing Accuracy — a ggregate timing error comprised of input edge placement accuracy, output edge placement accuracy and input to output timing accuracy.

The number of data points analyzed is intended to provide a minimum representative assessment of AC timing accuracy parameters in a practical amount of time. 3.1.3 This method uses only edge co mpare mode and non-multiplexed operation in providing a minimum representative assessment of AC timing accuracy. 3.1.4 This method does not determin e the effects that duty cycle variations have on AC timing accuracy. 3.1.5 Not being an exhaustive analy sis this method avoids comprehensive testing as might be expected for complex AC timing functions such as on-the-fly (OTF) timing.

In the case of timing-on-the fly a routine is contained in this method and can be used as a reference parameter for comparative purposes when systems with on-the-fly timing are analyzed. Thus only the most fundamental AC timing results are produced and OTF timing is not included as part of the overall timing accuracy (OTA) results. 3.1.6 Discretion is advised when int erpreting OTA results obtained from this method. Self-analysis cannot allow for all error components to be isolated. Thus good (compliant) method results should be viewed with caution as potentially compliant. On the other hand, poor (non-compliant) method results are a strong indication that the system under evaluation is questionable regarding its accuracy and most likely non-compliant.\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 4.1  SEMI Standard\n\nSEMI G79 –– Specification for Overall Digital Timing Accuracy\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Abbreviations and Acronyms  \n5.1.1 $\\boldsymbol { l } ^ { 1 }$ — tester output driver high level  \n5.1.2 $O ^ { 2 }$ — tester output driver low l evel  \n$5 . 1 . 3 \\ A T E$ —  automated test equipment  \n5.1.4  DUT — device under test  \n5.1.5 $\\boldsymbol { H } ^ { 3 }$ — tester input comparator expect high level.  \n5.1.6 $L ^ { 4 }$ — tester input comparator expect low level.  \n5.1.7 $n$ — highest pin/channel numb er, and Pin 1 – refers to the lowest pin/channel number.  \n5.1.8  NR — non-return signal forma t  \n5.1.9  RTO — return to one signal fo rmat.  \n5.1.10  RTZ — return to zero signal fo rmat.  \n5.1.11  SBC — surround by complement signal format.  \n$5 . 1 . 1 2 \\ Z$ — tester output driver high i mpedance (“off”) state.\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 5.2  Definitions\n\n5.2.1  device insertion errors — erro r influenced by device-input capacitance and/or terminations.  \n5.2.2  edge — time delay created by an ATE delay generation resource.  \n5.2.3  high bandwidth oscilloscope — digital sampling oscilloscope with $> 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ bandwidth, using probes with $> 1$ GHz bandwidth,  500 ohm input impedance, $2 . 5 \\mathrm { p F } \\pm 0 . 5 \\mathrm { p F }$ input capacitance and $\\textless 0 . 1 2 5 \"$ ground lead.\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 5.2.4  pin — tester channel\n\n5.2.5  performance board — printed circuit board used to interface the tester channels to the device under test.  \n5.2.6  test fixturing errors — error in fluenced by mismatched signal path lengths, impedance discontinuities, lumped capacitance/inductance elements, and high frequency loss due to skin effect or interconnects.  \n5.2.7  window compare — monitor d evice continuously during a time interval.  \n5.2.8  zero_reference_measurement — oscilloscope measurement of the midpoint of a 0–3v NR signal rising edge with delay $= \\ 0 \\mathrm { s }$ .

The hierarchy supports two levels of specification analysis. Broad, composite net results are available by using the ATE for self-analysis in Level 1. 6.2 At this level, a large amount o f data can be efficiently collected, representing the net conformance to overall timing accuracy specifications. This technique, however, precludes isolation and detailed analysis of specific accuracy components. Therefore, a second level of analysis, incorporating external instruments is included. While the first level provides efficient, broad analysis, the second level provides less efficient, detailed analysis. 6.3 Results from the analyses are s aved in a standard format to facilitate further use for application specific data reduction.

Execute the method to completion. The application program can capture the data for Level 1 and Level 2 and store that for later analysis. 5. This procedure calls for various time measurements to be made at specified voltage points or signal levels. The user is encouraged to maintain these values to keep the method results constants when system to system comparisons are being made.

This is important when making time measurements relative to a particular transition point on a signal edge. This method recommends that when signal measurements are specified at a particular transition point, i.e., $50 \\%$ , that this point on the edge be determined relative to the $0 \\%$ or $100 \\%$ steady state levels displayed on the oscilloscope, after any aberrations due to the transition have expired. A tester reference channel, the lowest channel, should be used to set the measurement point(s) and then consistently used as the basis for subsequent measurements for the remaining tester channels. 7.

Regardless, the user is advised that tester and external equipment interaction accommodated by the application program is necessary for data collection at Level 2. 10.3 Level 1 Tests — Level 1 tests a re intended to efficiently gather a large amount of data by taking advantage of the self-analysis ability of the ATE. This is accomplished by shorting adjacent tester channels together on a performance board with minimum, equal length interconnections, and using one channel to test the other. Reference Figure 1.

The test pattern should be written to switch all even or odd pins simultaneously, and for all transitions and associated strobes to occur at least 100 times for each data point. 10.3.2 For clarification all drive edge s are detected in parallel in pairs.

The self-analysis procedures may also mask some error terms that contribute to other specification components. Therefore, Level 2 modules are intended to supplement Level 1 results by using external instruments to distinguish individual specification components and provide detailed analysis of potentially masked results. The use of external instruments facilitates independent observation of individual parameters, but requires physical movement of a probe (unless automated with robotics), which results in less efficient data collection. Reference Figure 4. 10.4.1 Drive Input Timing Error Test — Since the driver input timing error cannot be distinguished from compare output timing error with Level 1 tests9 an external instrument must be used to isolate the driver input timing error from compare output timing error.

This requires independent measurements of representative driver input timing conditions. The reference for measurement of driver input timing error is a high bandwidth-digital sampling oscilloscope. Exhaustive testing of all pins is impractical, so a reduced set of representative conditions is used. A non-binary pin sampling increment is used to ensure that traditional binary architectural boundaries are crossed.

Use the lowest tester pin as a reference channel when setting the measurement points for these measurements. 10.4.3.3 ATE systems may use a focused calibration routine for driver pins. That routine is intended to correct edge error due to transition time variations. In the context of executing this method for a machine that has this capability, the user of this method is advised to: 1) Execute the Drive Input Transition Time Variation test regardless, and 2) Enter the test results to the method data summary, Table 2.

Data can be manually or automatically entered to this table as this procedure is executed, depending upon how the user chooses to implement data collection.  \n11.2  Table 2 is intended to contain the final conclusions or analysis results of this procedure.  Data for this table is taken from Table 1.  Instructions for entering data to Table 2 will be described in Section 12, Reporting and Interpretation of Results, of this procedure.  Examples of OTA calculations and data entry to Table 2 are contained in Appendix 2.  \nNOTE 4: A blank version of Table 2 is contained in Appendix 1.\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: 12.1 Reporting Results — A large a mount of data will be gathered when this Test Method is executed per the requirements of this method. A subset of this data should be collected into Table 1. This table contains the minimum and maximum values for the various tests contained in this Test Method. 12.1.1 Table 2 is a summary revealin g the results of this Test Method. Table 2 entries will be determined from values taken out of Table 1 as well as summations of various entries occurring in Table 2. The following is a guide to making entries to Table 2: 12.1.2 Driver Input Timing Delay Error (Section 10.4.1) — This value is taken from Table 1. It is the difference between the minimum and maximum values shown in Table 1 for this parameter. 12.1.3 Driver Input Timing Cycle Jitt er (Section 10.4.4) — This value is taken from Table 1.

It is the difference between the minimum and maximum values shown in Table 1 for this parameter. 12.1.5 Driver Input Edge Placement Accuracy — Driver Input Edge Placement by definition is the summation of Driver Input Timing Delay Error (Section 10.4.1), Driver Input Timing Cycle Jitter (Section 10.4.4), and Driver Input Transition Time Variation (Section 10.4.3). Regardless, since Drive Input Timing Delay Error measurements defined in this method do not exclude edge transition variation and jitter this entry is simply the measurements results obtained for Drive Input Timing Delay Error Level 2 (Section 10.4.1). Enter this value into Table 2 as Driver Input Edge Placement. 12.1.6 Compare Output Time Delay E rror (Section 10.4.2) — This value is taken from Table 1.

Refer to examples in Appendix 2. 12.1.9 Overall Timing Accuracy $( O T A ) \\mathrm { ~ ~ { ~ - ~ } ~ } \\mathrm { \\bf B y }$ definition and in the general case, the OTA value is the sum of Driver Input Edge Placement Accuracy, Compare Output Edge Placement Accuracy, and Driver Input to Compare Output Timing Accuracy. Examples are provided in Appendix 2 for making this entry into Table 2. NOTE 5: For all High Speed Clock parameters shown in Table 2: High Speed Clock Delay and High Speed Clock Transition are parameters that use the same procedures as Drive Input Timing Delay and Drive Input Transition Time\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: Variation. High Speed Clock Delay and High Speed Clock Transition are parameters provided in this procedure to accommodate those systems that have different pin electronics for the High Speed Clock function. If the system under evaluation doesn't have a High Speed Clock function, then the steps in this procedure for all High Speed Clock Accuracy are not required. High Speed Clock Cycle Jitter and High Speed Clock Phase Jitter are reference parameters with their respective test provided in this procedure to reveal accuracy for the High Speed Clock function when that function is present. 12.1.10 High Speed Clock Delay Error (Section 10.4.1) — This value is taken from Table 1. It is the difference between the minimum and maximum values shown in Table 1 for this parameter. 12.1.11 High Speed Clock Cycle Jitter (Section 10.4.5) — This value is taken from Table 1.

It is the difference between the minimum and maximum values shown in Table 1 for this parameter. 12.1.13 High Speed Clock Phase Jitter (Section 10.4.6) — This value is taken from Table 1. This is the RMS values shown in Table 1 for this parameter. 12.1.14 High Speed Clock Accuracy — This parameter is for systems that have a High Speed Clock function. High Speed Clock Accuracy is simply the same entry made for High Speed Clock Delay Error. High Speed Clock Transition Time Variation, High Speed Clock Cycle Jitter, and High Speed Clock Phase Jitter are reference parameters and should be entered to the appropriate location in Table 2. 12.1.15 Driver Input Z Timing Errors (Section 10.3.5) — There are four Drive Input Z Timing Errors. Each value is determined in the same way and is to be entered into Table 2. This value is taken from Table 1. Data to enter here is Positive Error and Negative Error per the\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: data in Table 1 and Equation 1, Appendix 2. 12.1.16 Timing Linearity (Section 10.3 .1) — This value is established from Table 1. Data to enter here is Positive Error and Negative Error per the data in Table 1 and Equation 1, Appendix 2. These two values should be entered at the appropriate place in Table 2. 12.1.17 Extended Delay (Section 10.3. 4) — This value is taken from Table 1. Data to enter here is Positive Error and Negative Error per the data in Table 1 and Equation 1, Appendix 2. 12.1.18 Multiple Period (Section 10.3. 6) — This parameter is optional. The test method for this parameter was defined for those systems with Timing On the Fly (OTF). If the system under evaluation does not have OTF timing data entry for this parameter is not required. Else, this value is taken from Table 1. Data to enter here is Positive Error and Negative Error per the data in Table 1 and Equation 1, Appendix 2. 12.2 Interpreting Results — Table 2 will contain summarized data,\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: results of the Overall Digital Timing Accuracy Analysis Method for automated test systems. 12.2.1 This dialog is intended to explain the Level 1 and Level 2 results for OTA contained in Table 2 and require reference to Figure 6, Figure $7 ^ { 1 5 }$ , and Table 2. 12.2.2 Level 1 analysis is meant to de termine a test system’s net conformance to the OTA specification in an efficient manner. 12.2.3 Level 2 employs external equipment to isolate parameters that contribute to OTA. That data reveals a more detailed and accurate representation to OTA conformance. Regardless, there is a limitation at getting to OTA entirely through Level 2 data collection. 12.2.4 Level 1 and Level 2 parameter s are contained in Table 2 to represent OTA (Overall Timing Accuracy). Level 1 Timing Linearity (Section 10.3.1) provides analysis for all pins under comprehensive conditions and is used to acquire the drive input to compare output error parameter. Extended Delay (Section 10.3.4)\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: complements Timing Linearity by verifying accuracy for timing generator delays beyond the length of the test cycle, and can be (optionally) used in lieu of Section 10.3.1. These two Level 1 elements represent in part OTA. Thus, this method produces a single point representation of system OTA, per the methodology defined in this method and consistent with the definition of OTA. This is done by summing Level 2 Drive Input Edge Placement Accuracy and Compare Output Edge Placement Accuracy with Level 1 Drive Input to Compare Output Timing Accuracy. 12.2.4.1 Compare side error in this met hod is not fully characterized or broken out into its constituent components, per the defintion of Compare Output Edge Placement Error. This method does establish Output Timing Delay Error, and its measurement contains the jitter component. But the method does not contain a way for determining Output Compare Timing Jitter by itself. 12.2.5 Establishing OTA using only L evel 2 data is\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: not possible. Only two of the three components per the standard definition of OTA can be determined. The OTA definition states: OTA is the sum of Drive Input Edge Placement, Compare Output Edge Placement, and Drive Input to Compare Output Accuracy. Level 2 analysis will collect data for the first two error components. The Level 2 parameter not achievable is Drive Input to Compare Output Accuracy. Level 1 will determine that value. 12.2.5.1 The Drive Input to Compare Output Accuracy by definition is the difference between the average of min & max drive input delay timing and the average of min & max compare output delay timing. Values for those components are in the Level 2 data, but because there is no common reference point for these two components when the data is taken, their difference cannot be established from the data at-hand. 12.2.5.2 In summary Level 2 analysis is capable of independently determining and isolating drive input timing error and compare\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: output timing error. But, Level 2 drive input to compare output-timing error can not be established. Analysis done in Level 1 is required to establish Drive Input to Compare Output timing error. Reference Figure 6. 12.2.6 As noted, Level 1 analysis does establish drive input to compare output-timing error. But, Level 1 cannot independently determine and isolate drive input timing error from compare output timing error, as was accomplished in Level 2. What this means is if the minimum to maximum drive input to compare output timing error is established as 1ns (Level 1), the method cannot create a break down such that so much of that 1ns is input error, with the remaining part of that 1ns being the output error. 12.2.7 Table 2 data also contains other valuable components of ATE error that will assist in establishing ATE timing integrity. Tests that establish the various components of Input Z Timing error, Multiple Period Tests for on the fly timing, and for systems\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: with a High Speed Clock function tests to determine various delay, jitter and time variation errors. 12.3 A brief word on Drive Input to Compare Output Timing Accuracy will be made. Drive Input to Compare Output Timing can be described in different ways. It is easy to think of this parameter, per the definition of this aspect of OTA (reference Figure 6), as simply the relative time difference (skew) between drive input delay timing (see SEMI G79) and compare output delay timing (see SEMI G79), for a particular machine.16 But this parameter, once established, is not necessarily constant. For example, this parameter can change from one calibration of a machine at a particular time, to something different, as a result of a subsequent calibration of that same machine. As well, Drive Input to Compare Output error can also be considered as a machine to machine accuracy parameter, not necessarily having the same value between any two machines of the same kind. 12.3.1\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: Thus, on each machine and at different points in time for the same machine the Drive Input to Compare Output Timing skew can be uniquely different per machine. That difference being influenced by the various machine anomalies that contribute to machine error including the not so perfect results of a periodic edge calibration. 12.3.2 In the general case drive input to compare output as shown in Figure 6 should be thought of in the context of drive/compare edges having time variance across multiple machines or as representing edges for the same machine but having variance across multiple time intervals associated with different calibrations. 12.3.3 Examination of the OTA defin ition in the context of Figure 6, that being the general case and not a single point timing evaluation, reveals that the overall timing accuracy time value is the time line indicated by “A” and the time line indicated by “B”. In a single point AC timing evaluation, OTA is determined as a\n\nSEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results (Part 13)\n\nTitle: SEMI G80-0200TEST METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF OVERALL DIGITAL TIMINGACCURACY FOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT - # 12  Reporting and Interpretati on of Results\n\nContent: distribution of edges associated with time line “A” or time line “B”, depending upon the relationship between the drive edge values and compare edge values (see SEMI G79) at that point in time.",
