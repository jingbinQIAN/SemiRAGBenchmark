They may or may not be used as a foundation to specify an epitaxial wafer for use in device manufacture. Their usefulness can be increased by considering the guides prior to developing a device design or process. The required specification is deter-mined by the device and the process design, the guides are suggestions from which a specification can evolve. 11.2 An epitaxial guide can be viewed as a generic epitaxial wafer specification or as an example of a specification. These tables provide common epitaxial wafer characteristics which describe starting wafers useful for the manufacture of some twin tub CMOS devices. 11.3 The guides in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 provide a series of options intended to increase the awareness of epitaxial specifications and to provide information from which a specification can be formulated. 11.4 SEMI M18 was used as a template for formulating these tables."

    "content": "Title: SEMI M17-0704 GUIDE FOR A UNIVERSAL WAFER GRID - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This document defines a grid pattern that is useful for quantifying surface defects on a nominally circular semiconductor wafer. The grid is defined such that it contains 1000 elements of approximately equal area. Each grid element thus contains 0.1 percent of the total quality area of the surface being inspected. Defects that are non-uniformly distributed (for example, slip) can be quantified in terms of the percent defective (or percent useful) area on the wafer surface. 2.2 The grid described is referenced to the center of the wafer. A concept of a “Fixed Quality Area” is used, based on nominal wafer diameter, such as is specified in SEMI M1. 2.3 Methods for observing these defects on silicon wafer surfaces are outside the scope of this guide. Such methods may be found in SEMI MF1725, SEMI MF1726, JIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 0 9$ , and DIN 50434.

The grid is divided by 18 concentric circles containing radial divisions which are assigned according to the diameter of each circle (see Table 1). The relative diameters of the concentric circles are established by the areas of each annulus. To find the actual diameter of any circle, multiply the relative diameter by the outer diameter of the grid. 5.1.2 The outer diameter of the grid is chosen to be the size appropriate for a particular application. This diameter would normally be chosen to be the nominal diameter of the fixed quality area to allow for such things as an edge exclusion, tolerance variations in the wafer diameter, and edge rounding.

The divisions are numbered starting with the first division counterclockwise from the horizontal line which starts at the center of the grid and extends to the right, when the primary fiducial (flat or notch) is placed at the bottom of the grid. Divisions are progressively numbered counterclockwise from 01 to $n$ , where $n$ equals the total number of divisions on the circle. An element’s address is given by two sets of numbers separated by a comma: circle (0–18), division $( 0 1 { - } n )$ . Elements 18, 01 and 18, 100 are identified in Figure 1."

This angle was chosen because it lies between the maximum and minimum included angles of the primary flats specified in SEMI M1 for $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ , $1 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter wafers. In addition, if a fixed quality area of radius $3 \\mathrm { m m }$ less than the nominal wafer radius (or smaller) is used, the grid will not in any case extend beyond the edge of the wafer in the region of the primary flat. 5.3.2 This flat is propagated into the wafer as illustrated in Figure 2. The diameter of each circle is the same as for wafers without a primary flat. The flat is propagated vertically downward (starting with circle number 3) by the intersection of the circle with a horizontal chord which subtends $4 3 . 2 ^ { \\circ }$ 5.3.3 The areas of the grid elements within the propagated flat region are slightly smaller than the areas of the"

This encompasses the full range of conductivity characteristics for Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). Section 3 considers subclasses of these characteristics defining the species which may be used for producing the conductivity type. For semi-insulating material, special cases have been isolated. Undoped, Grade A1 represents those materials which are of high resistivity and stable following growth, without necessitating any additional annealing or processing. The Grade A2 material, “high purity”, requires additional thermal processing following growth to bring the resistivity to a level $> \\bar { 1 0 } ^ { 7 } \\Omega$ -cm. At this time, most producers have indicated that the majority of the Grade A2 ingots have resistivity characteristics which rise into the acceptable range after an appropriate thermal cycle. However, this phenomenon is sensitive to the details of the timetemperature cycle, and thus, such an increase cannot be"

However, due to the rapid diffusion of $\\mathrm { C r }$ during processing and the propensity for surface accumulation, it is not as well suited to processing as grades 3.A.1 and 3.A.2, thus we assign this material “grade A”. Iso-electric dopant additions do not appear to affect the resistivity significantly, but rather, permit the reduction of dislocation generation in the final product. Thus, this material is classified Grade A. While In is the most effective hardening agent, Al, P, and Sb are also viable species. They are included for completeness and to reduce the likelihood of document revision at a later date. The Grade B specification encompasses those materials where the impurity and point defect densities are not quite in the proper balance, but the resistivity is suitable for less-stringent applications.

Section 4 defines the resistivity and stability of semiinsulating material as specified in Section 3. A stringent limit was placed on the Grade A2 material to minimize the likelihood that this material converts to low resistivity upon annealing. The issue of surface conversion in Cr-doped material was dealt with by eliminating a requirement for n-type characteristics following annealing. The resistivity ranges for n-type conducting material were determined from the carrier concentration table (Section 5) and mobility values, using the analysis of Walukiewicz et al, J. Appl. Phys. 50 (1979) 899. This places a constraint on the permissible compensation ratio, selected to be in the range of approximately 0.0 to 0.7. The specification was designed then to exclude abnormally poor crystals. As limited data and demand exist for p-type material, there are no ranges specified at this writing."

Many of these scan the wafer periphery and determine the geometric center of the wafer surface. This is most often seen on stepping aligners, to minimize the effects of wafer-to-wafer diameter variation in mixed aligner type fabs. Similar centerreferencing subsystems are found on many characterization systems. The wafer coordinate system provides a method for referencing any other coordinate system, such as a site, pattern, or mapping array, to the physical geometry of the wafer surface. 1.2 If the points of the array lie on the front surface of the wafer, only the $x$ and $y$ (or $r$ and $\\theta$ ) coordinates are relevant. It has become increasingly important in semiconductor material and device manufacturing to describe, in unambiguous terms, the position of a point on a wafer that automatic processing, test, or characterization equipment can recognize and locate.

The wafer coordinate system can be used to establish the coordinates of each point of interest, and, through transformation to the yield analysis coordinate system, relate them to the die yield map. $1 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { I n }$ response to these needs, this practice defines a wafer coordinate system to facilitate the precise locating and reporting of points on the wafer surface. If the point or points lie above or below the surface, the $z \\mathrm { . }$ - coordinate must also be used. Because the zero point on the $z$ -axis is application specific, this practice treats the $x { - } y { - } z$ (or $r – \\theta – z$ ) system separately from the surface coordinate system."

This is opposite to the convention used for the polar angle in the wafer coordinate system. 3.3 Also in SEMI M1, the coordinate system for the edge profile template is, unlike the wafer coordinate system, edge referenced. In addition, the edge profile template uses the $x$ coordinate for the radial direction (positive from the wafer edge inward) and the $y$ coordinate for the vertical direction (positive from the wafer surface toward the median plane of the wafer). 3.4 In SEMI E5, the “normal” position of the wafer is defined similarly to that in the wafer coordinate system; that is, the primary fiducial is downward and its bisector is the negative $y$ -axis.

R1-1 An example of a regular 29-column by 9-row array, truncated for application to a wafer, is shown in Figure R1-1. The Starting Element includes the array center because there are odd numbers of both columns and rows. In addition, Figure R1-1 shows the element addresses for elements along the right half of the horizontal array centerline, for elements along column 1, and for selected other elements in the array. Also shown are the left hand corner elements (which lie outside the truncated array). R1-2 Figure R1-2 shows the same truncated array fitted onto a wafer. Because the truncation is not symmetrical around the vertical array centerline, the array center is located to the left of the wafer center. Figure R1-1 Array"
