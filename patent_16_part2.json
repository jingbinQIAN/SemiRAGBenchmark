Many electronic products are experiencing overheating during operation, primarily due to the heat produced by electronic components not being effectively dissipated in a timely manner. Improvements in cover/case/shell/back panel materials could help to facilitate heat dissipation in electronic products such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, chassis, and other similar devices. The choice of materials for customer electronics cover/case/shell/back panels can vary. For instance, some mobile phones employ metal or alloys for their back panel material, which exhibit excellent thermal conductivity. However, metals or alloys also exhibit significant visible light absorption characteristics, consequently intensifying heat generation issues when subjected to direct sunlight. Currently, polymer materials are used in some electronic device covers, but they suffer from low thermal conductivities.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0003] According to one aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic device includes an electronic circuitry and a cover having an inner surface thermally coupled with the electronic circuitry.

The materials and techniques presented in the following present materials that can offer superior thermal conductivity, while mitigating substantial visible light absorption, and incorporate additional cooling mechanisms to further enhance heat dissipation and thermal management effect for electronic products. [0053] More specifically, materials and composites that can provide high thermal conductivity while minimizing heat absorption from external sources are presented. Embodiments can include high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composites with boron nitride (BN) additives to achieve enhanced thermal conductivity, which can be applied in electronic packaging. Similarly, the use of polymer-based composites with thermally conductive fillers like aluminum nitride (AIN) and silicon carbide (SiC) are applicable for heat dissipation applications. Radiative cooling, where materials emit heat as infrared radiation, can also be as a passive cooling strategy by using materials with high emissivity in the mid-infrared spectrum, such as between 7-13 ym, where the earth's atmosphere is most transparent to thermal radiation. This approach can potentially allow devices to dissipate heat directly into the coldness of space, bypassing the ambient air temperature. In addition to thermal conductivity and radiative cooling, the reflectivity of materials in the visible spectrum can also be an important factor. Materials with high solar reflectivity can prevent the absorption of sunlight, thereby reducing the thermal load on electronic devices. [0054] Embodiments presented in the following integrate these material properties of high thermal conductivity, high mid-infrared emissivity, and high solar reflectivity into a single composite material for thermal management strategies for consumer electronics. Such materials would not only efficiently conduct heat away from electronic components but also radiatively cool the device and reflect solar radiation, providing a comprehensive solution to the overheating problem in electronics. [0055] The making and using of embodiments of this disclosure are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the concepts disclosed herein can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts, and that the specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative and do not serve to limit the scope of the claims. Further, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure as defined by the appended claims. [0056] Figures 1A-1D show several views of a consumer electronics device, in this example a smartphone. More specifically, Figures 1A-1D respectively show a front, back, longer side, and short side of a smartphone 101. All of these views show the cover 103, but the screen 105 is only visible in the front view. The cover 103 referred to here is the cover/case/shell/back panel that is the packaging containing the electronics, not an additional protective cover as is often added by a user, although the material described here could also be applied for these added covers. The smartphone 101 is used here as the main example of a consumer electronics device, but other examples could be tablets, laptops, chassis, and other similar devices. [0057] __ Figure 2 is a cut-away view of a smartphone showing some of the internal circuitry and part of the back cover. Depending on the consumer electronics device, the interior electronics will vary, but will often include a printed circuit board (PCB) 201 on which are mounted components that form a circuitry including semiconductor chips 205, 207, and 209 (such as processors, memory die, or other electronic elements), surface mount device (such as capacitors), external contacts, and other components that are connected though the PCB 201 as well as power sources such as voltage lines or buses and batteries or power supplies. The PCB 201 is thermally coupled to the cover 103 on its inner surface (upper surface in the figure) and has an opposing exterior surface. [0058] During operation, the circuitry generates heat that is conducted through the PCB 201 to the cover 103. In addition to internally generated heat, the smartphone 101 or other device is also subject to other heat sources, such as from the ambient temperature or from exposure to sun light. This can be illustrated with respect to Figure 3. [0059] __ Figure 3 illustrates an electronic device exposed to sunlight and radiating heat. Radiation 303 from the sun 301 is incident on the cover 103, resulting in heating of the electronic device. The solar heating of the electronic device is in addition to the internally generated heat as well as that due to the ambient temperature. These different contributions will be more or less important depending on the circumstances, so that when out of the sun the internally generated heat may be dominant, while, when off and, for example, left on a car dashboard, the solar radiation 303 and ambient heat may be the main contribution. The electronic device will radiate heat from its cover 103, as represented at 305. To maintain the electron device within its preferred temperature operating range, it is important to maximize the radiated heat 305 from the device. [0060] The embodiments presented in the following discussion enhance the efficiency of heat dissipation in customer electronics through a material solution. The material solution embodiments combine high thermal conductivity, high mid-infrared emissivity, and high solar reflectivity into a single composite material to improve the thermal management strategies for consumer electronics. The thermal management strategies of these material solution include radiative cooling effect, thermal conductivity effects, and solar reflectivity effect. To achieve good radiative cooling efficiency, embodiments of the composite material can possess absorption (a * thickness) higher than, for example, 0.025 (i.e., 2.5% of incident radiation) for radiation of wavelengths between 7 to 13 microns with absorption lower than 0.05 (i.e., 5% of incident radiation) for wavelengths between 0.4 to 2.5 microns. To achieve good thermal conductivity, embodiments for the composite material can also possesses a thermal conductivity coefficient (lambda, A) higher than, e.g., 1.0 W/(kelvin-meter). These techniques present a scalable and low-cost fabrication method for consumer electronics. Additionally, the materials can be selected so that the cover is also an [0061] For consumer electronics cover materials, manufacturers often opt for metals or metal alloys based on their high thermal conductivity. However, it is worth noting that metals possess light-absorption qualities, making them susceptible to heating when exposed to well-lit environments. On the other hand, employing pure polymer materials can reduce visible light absorption, but these may fall short in terms of thermal conductivity. For example, a porous PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane ) film can efficiently reflect solar light and it has long-wave infrared emission to induce a sub- ambient temperature drop, but the PDMS film itself acts as a thermal insulator, impeding the efficient dissipation of heat. High crystallinity polyethylene (PE) can exhibit superior thermal conductivity compared to conventional polymer materials; however, fabrication techniques for high crystallinity PE can impose constraints on material thickness, rendering it unsuitable for structural components in consumer products. The embodiments presented below employ a composite material to tackle these challenges, providing a comprehensive solution to the overheating problem in electronics and enhance heat dissipation and thermal management effect for electronic products. [0062] The embodiments of the cover as presented here combine three elements as acomposite material: a polymer matrix with a rough surface for enhanced radiative cooling and/or high crystallinity for improved thermal conductivity; a layered structure or blend mixture of additive nanoparticles for improved thermal conductivity and mid- infrared emissivity; and a solar-reflective surface coating to reduce solar absorption. In embodiments, the composite material can possess an absorption (a* thickness) exceeding 0.025 (i.e., 2.5% of incident radiation) for radiation wavelengths between 7 to 13 um, and an absorption below 0.05 (i.e., 5% of incident radiation) for wavelengths between 0.4 to 2.5 microns. The final composite material possesses a thermal conductivity coefficient (A) surpassing 1.0 W/(Km). The enhanced thermal conductivity compared to normal polymer materials can greatly facilitate heat dissipation. The high mid-infrared emissivity allows radiative cooling effect to occur and allows electronic products to dissipate heat directly into the coldness of space without other power input. The solar-reflective surface coating will reduce heat absorption when the devices are exposed to sunlight. [0063] | Embodiments presented here for the packaging (i.e., cover/case/shell/back panel) of electronic devices provide a material solution to realize a radiative cooling, thermal conductive, and solar reflective composite material combining the three components in the composite material: polymer matrix, filler, and solar reflecting component. The polymer matrix can employ radiative cooling polymers that have strong emission in the mid-infrared (IR) range, and low absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible range and near IR. Radiative cooling polymers in the composite material can contribute to realizing high radiative cooling power. Examples of such polymers can include: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), fluorinated polymers such as polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafiuoraprapylene (PVDF- HFP), among others, as well as chlorinated polymers. Crystalline polymers with controlled crystallinity, which are polymers with a high degree of crystallinity, can also be used. In the crystalline zone, polymer chains are aligned in a regular, periodic manner so that highly crystallized polymers will facilitate high thermal conductivity by enhancing phonon transport through lattice vibration. Examples of crystalline polymers can include: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), nylon, and polyester. Embodiment can also use crystalline radiative cooling polymers, which are highly crystalline polymers that have strong emission in the mid-IR range, and low absorption in the UV to visible range. Crystalline radiative cooling polymers can contribute to achieving high radiative cooling power and high thermal conductivity. Examples of crystalline radiative cooling polymers can include: polypropylene, polyester, polyvinylidene difluoride, and vinylidene difluoride (VDF) containing copolymers. [0064] With respect to the filler materials distributed within the polymer matrix, these can include nanoparticles and/or microparticles that have a high thermal conductivity and can be in different shapes, including spheric, rod, tube, sheet, among others. Material examples of such filler materials can include: diamond nanoparticles, graphene, graphene oxide, boron nitride nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles (silver, copper, aluminum, gold), ceramics nanoparticles: silicon carbide (SiC), and aluminum nitride (AIN). For fillers with high emissivity, these can include nanoparticles and/or microparticles that have high emissivity in the wavelength range from 7-13 um, for example. Examples of filers with high emissivity can include inorganic material, such as SiO2 nanoparticles, CuO nanoparticle, graphene oxide nanoparticle, ZnO, TiO2, Silicon, a-quartz, silicon oxynitride, ZnS, and CdS. Other examples of filers with high emissivity can include polymer materials such nanoparticles of PDMS and PVDF, among others. [0065] Embodiments can also employ fillers with combined functionality that contribute to realizing high radiative cooling power and high thermal conductivity in the composite material. Two or more fillers, with different functionalities, may be combined to achieve different goals. For example, one can be one filler that has the combined functionalities high thermal conductivity and high emission in mid-IR wavelength range (e.g., from 7-13 um). Examples of combined functionality materials can include combinations of two fillers with different functionality, such as copper nanoparticles and SiO2 nanoparticles, of one filler with combined functionality, such as boron nitride nanoparticles. [0066] With respect to the solar responsive component of the material formulations, these can be used to significantly reduce, such as by 90% or more, solar absorption to minimize the solar heating effect illustrated by Figure 3. The solar responsive component can include one or both of a reflective component of a diffractive component. Examples of a reflective component can be polished metal or photonic structures, such as a silver mirror or 2D-layered structures. Embodiments of diffractive components can have a porous structure with pore sizes in a range in the wavelength of the solar spectra or nanoparticles with sizes that range in the wavelength of solar spectra. Examples of diffractive components can include: porous PVDF polymers, porous PDMS, and TiO2 nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the solar reflecting/diffracting functionality can be realized by the composite, such as by fillers (e.g., BN, silver nano particles), where in these those formulations an additional solar reflective component may not be necessary. [0067] The described combination of a polymer matrix, filler, and solar responsive component provide a material solution towards combinational thermal management strategy by combining passive radiative cooling, solar reflecting, and high thermal conductivity. In the composite material for the case, the material selection can be broadened in the composite material by considering the different functionalities (radiative cooling, thermal conductive, solar reflective) that can be realized by different components (polymer matrix, filler, solar reflective component). This allows for different embodiments to focus on one functionality of one component in the composite material, which will broaden the material selection. [0068] Considering the composite material structure further, controlling the material structure at nanometer and/or micrometer level can be important to achieve high performance in all the aspects for thermal management. Figures 4-6 illustrate three embodiments for material structures based on the filler distribution patterns in the polymer matrix. [0069] Figure 4 illustrates a “raisin-in-bread” embodiment with a non-homogenous arrangement of the composite material of polymer matrix and fillers. In a raisin-in- bread structure, the composite material 401 has the fillers 405 randomly distributed within the polymer matrix 403. The different portions of the fillers 405 may or may not contact each other depending on loading contents of a given embodiment. [0070] Figure 5 illustrates an embodiment of a 3D-network structure for the composite material of polymer matrix and fillers. In this embodiment for the composite material 501, one filler 505 (the lighter colored portions) forms a 3D connecting network that is embedded in polymer matrix 503 (the lighter colored portions). One or more additional fillers can be randomly distributed in the polymer matrix, where contact between fillers may or may not happen depending on the loading content of these other fillers. [0071] Figure 6 illustrates an embodiment of a layered structure for the composite material of polymer matrix and fillers. At top, Figure 6 shows an oblique view of the composite material 601, with an expanded side view below. In the layered structure for the composite material, the fillers are concentrated in separated layers. Fillers 605 form a percolated arrangement in their layers, with different filler-rich layers separated by polymer matrix layers 603. There is no contact between fillers in different layers and the composite material can contain one or more than one filler. [0072] Previous radiative cooling or thermal conductive materials have been thin films or coating, which are not suitable for applications that require high mechanical strength bulky materials. The composite materials presented here are not only suitable for coating and films, but can also be used as structural materials for electronic packaging and outer case. The presented embodiments for composite material provide a platform of multi-functional material with tunable properties. For example, by controlling the layer thickness and layer number, the material provides a material platform with tunable properties including thermal conductivity, radiative cooling power, mechanical strength, rigidity/flexibility, and transparency. Additionally, the materials can be selected to provide electrical insulation. This platform provides the opportunity of optimizing materials based on application scenario. Figures 7-10 consider embodiments for process methods for the forming of the composite material structures. [0073] Figure 7 is a flowchart for an embodiment for forming of the composite material with a raisin-in-bread structure. In the raisin-in-bread composite structure, the main processes are dispersing to form the polymer matrix 701 and distributing the fillers 703. Dispersing 703 is the process to distribute fillers evenly in the polymer matrix, or matrix precursor, or solution/slurry/melt of the matrix. Depending on the embodiment, dispersing methods include mixing, ultrasonication, or in-situ chemical reaction, among others. Forming 701 refers to the process that polymer matrix sets. Forming methods include drying, lyophilization, cooling, in-situ polymerization, and high pressure treatment (thermal molding and cold molding), among others. In some embodiments, the matrix is formed first at 701, followed by dispersing 703. In other embodiments, the fillers are distributed into a matrix precursor or a solution/slurry/melt of the matrix, after which the matrix is formed, so that portions of 701 occur both before and after 703. [0074] Figures 8 and 9 present flowcharts for preparing composite material with 3D-network structures through scaffold removal. Important processes for these embodiments are the construction of 3D-network and infiltrating the polymer matrix. 3D network structures can be obtained through bottom-up synthesis methods including lyophilization of gel and scaffold removal. In one example of the embodiment of Figure 8, a mixture of BN, PVDF, and a water-soluble precursor (e.g., salt (NaCl)) is evaporated at 801 to form a BN/PVDF/NaCl composite, after which the water- soluble precursor is removed at 803 to form a BN-PVDF scaffold. Epoxy impregnation can then follow at 805 to form an epoxy/BN-PVDF composite. [0075] In one example of an embodiment according to Figure 9, components (e.g., h-BN and NH4HCOs) are mixed at 901 to form a tableted structure. Decomposing follows at 903 to form a 3D-BN foam at 903. The 3D-BN/epoxy composite can then be formed by infiltration at 905. [0076] Figure 10 is a flowchart for an embodiment of preparing the composite material with layered structures through electrospinning. The main processes in these embodiments are the constructing and stacking of layered structure. Methods include 3D printing, fiber forming and alignment technics such as electrospinning, and thermal mechanical alignment methods such as extrusion, hot rolling, uniaxial and biaxial stretching, zone drawing, and inject molding. Coating techniques can include spin coating, spray coating, blade coating, roll-to-roll coating, and lamination. In the example of Figure 10, at 1001 electrospinning is used to form fibers, such as by using a ut@2{r~gEdtmtq(PVA) solution to form electrospun PVA fibers, followed by boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) dispersion and then the peeling off and shredding of fibers at 1003 to provide multilayer BNNS-C-PVA. Pressing, such as at 25C to 90C, follows at 1005 to form alternating layers of the polymer matrix and the filler. [0077] Previous approaches to solution process and thermal mechanical alignment are limited to soluble polymers and thermoplastic polymers, whereas the embodiments presented here are not only applicable for most thermoplastic polymers regardless of their solubility, but also applicable for curable resins including epoxy and acrylate. Additionally, previous process approaches are limited to preparing polymer films and fibers, whereas the embodiments presented here are widely applicable in bulky structural material and composite material with complicated structures (multi-layered, 3D-network). [0078] Once the composite polymer matrix/filler material is formed, the solar responsive component can be formed on the outer surface of the case to aid the passive thermal management of the cover. Referring back to Figure 3, sunlight 303 transmitted through the atmosphere is incident on the case 103 and thermal radiation transmitted out at 305. The solar spectrum is peaked between 0.3-1.0 um and in the ultraviolet and visual spectrum, then tapering off into the infrared. The atmosphere transmission spectrum begins in the mid-IR region (around 4 ym) and extends into longer wavelengths. The transparency window of the atmosphere is at 7-13 um and has a large spectral overlap with the blackbody radiative spectrum at typical ambient temperatures near 26.85C. By having a solar responsive component, a high thermal conductivity and high emission within this transparency window, and low absorption in the visible and near-IR region (e.g., between 0.4 to 2.5 um) for minimized solar heat gain, passive thermal management of the cover can be optimized. Figure 11 illustrates a cover for an electronic device with a solar responsive component on its outer surface. [0079] Figure 11 illustrates a side view of an electronic device with the outer surface of case 103 facing upward and with a reflective and/or diffractive coating 1101. For example, this could correspond to the view of Figure 1D for the example of a smartphone. After the polymer matrix/filler composite is formed, such as described with respect to Figures 7-10, the solar component can be formed on the outer surface to significantly reduce (e.g., by 90% or more) solar absorption to minimize solar heating effect. The coating 1101 can include one or both of a reflective component of polished metal or photonic structures, such silver mirror or 2D layered structures, or a diffractive component, such as porous structures with pore sizes range in the wavelength of solar spectra or nanoparticles with sizes range in the wavelength of solar spectra, such as porous PVDF polymer, porous PDMS, and TiO2 nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the outer surface may not be a sperate coating, but rather the solar reflecting/diffracting functionality can be realized by fillers (e.g., BN, silver nano particles), so that an additional solar reflective component may not be necessary. [0080] Figure 12 is a plot of absorption and reflectivity/diffusivity of an example of the desired frequency behavior the solar responsive component. The broken line is reflectivity/diffusivity, which is high below about 2-3 microns to suppress solar heating, then dropping off to a low value (~0.1) in the mid-IR range. The solid line is absorption, which is conversely very low below about 2 microns and then increase to around 0.9 in the IR region. In particular, in the range of the transparency window of the atmosphere at 7-13 microns, as shown by the heavily weighted dashed line 1201, absorption is ~90%, while reflectivity/diffusivity is ~10 or less. [0081] Figure 13 is a flowchart of an embodiment for fabricating a composite material for heat dissipation in consumer electronics packaging. A polymer matrix having a high thermal emission in the mid-infrared and low absorption in the visible spectrum is formed at 1301. A filler material is distributed within the polymer matrix at 1303, where the filler material can include one or both of nanoparticles or microparticles having a high thermal conductivity and high emissivity in the mid- infrared range and low absorption in the near-infrared and visible spectrum. Some embodiments for the composite material formed in 1301 and 1303 can be as described with respect to Figures 4, 5, and 6, where 1301 and 1303 would respectively correspond to the processes of Figures 7, 8 or 9, and 10. At 1305, the outer surface of the case is formed, where this can be as described above with respect to Figures 11 and 12. [0082] The embodiments presented above can provide a material solution towards a combinatorial thermal management strategy by combining passive radiative cooling, solar reflecting, and high thermal conductivity. The embodiments of composite material provides a platform of multi-functional materials with tunable properties, including thermal conductivity, radiative cooling power, polymer crystallinity, mechanical strength, flexibility, and transparency. This platform provides the opportunity of optimizing materials based on application scenario. The ability to use a broad material selection in the composite material structure can minimize the potential side-effect caused by the change of components, thus greatly broaden the material selection. The proposed process methods are widely applicable for thermoplastic polymers, soluble polymers and curable resins. This allows the techniques to applied to a wide application area, including electronics packaging for enhanced thermal management; structural material or coating for exterior case of consumer electronic devices.
