Because the majority of gas delivery systems are shipped in a vertical orientation, this convention is maintained for the purpose of the transportation simulation tests. Thus the vertical orientation would have the gas delivery system mounted vertically with respect to the vibration table top (see Figure 2), the longitudinal orientation would have the gas delivery system mounted flat to the vibration table top (see Figure 1), and the transverse orientation would have the gas delivery system mounted on its side, against the vibration table top (see Figure 3). Note that the terms “vertical,” “longitudinal,” and “transverse,” are contextual to motor freight transport, and receive different acceleration levels, within MIL-STD-810.

Auger electrons are generated all through this illuminated volume. The Inelastic Mean Free Path (IMFP) of an electron in a solid is the mean distance through the solid that an electron can travel before losing some of its energy (suffering an inelastic interaction). The IMFP is a function of the electron’s energy and the matrix through which it is traveling. Electrons with an energy typical of Auger and ESCA electrons, approximately $1 \\mathrm { k e V }$ , have an IMFP of about 10 angstroms. That means that a $1 \\ \\mathrm { k e V }$ electron will travel, on average, 10 angstroms before interacting with the matrix and giving up some of its energy. In other words it will be scattered to lower energy and will not be part of the photoelectron or Auger electron line for its element. The IMFP is a statistical parameter and an electron may travel"

There is one school that believes that it is 5 IMFPs and another that uses 3 IMFPs. These two functions will be referred to as $5 \\lambda$ and $3 \\lambda$ respectively. It will be seen that it makes little difference which function is used even though the depth of the oxide films is of the order of the functions. These functions are seen in Figure A1-3, which shows the proportion of the total signal generated from each depth below the surface. The Y-axis is in decimal and the X-axis is in angstroms from the surface. The first point of the $5 \\lambda$ curve is 0.16 at the $1 ^ { \\mathrm { s t } }$ angstrom level.

Ultrapure water systems need to be tested and monitored to ensure that the UPW being produced matches the specifications established by the manufacturing process. The purity of the UPW may affect device yield unless a wide range of parameters is closely controlled at the point of distribution (POD). Semiconductor devices are currently being designed with smaller linewidths $( < 0 . 1 3 - 0 . 1 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and are more susceptible to low level impurities. 2.2 UPW systems are monitored for continuous performance for desired and achievable levels of quality. Action limits are generally set to determine when system performance data warrants that corrective action is needed. Table 1 Parameters and Range of Performance in SEMI F63 may be a useful reference for establishing quality levels. 2.3 In more critical processes, the quality of the UPW also needs to be monitored at the POU where the UPW is in"

The quality of the UPW should not be expected to be identical to the quality of the UPW being produced at final filter (FF), which is not subject to conditions within the tool or distribution system. 2.4 These guides logically follow the series of SEMI guides developed for UPW, which include a standard defining the performance of a UPW system, and a standard defining the quality of UPW (see reference section). The Schematic of a Typical Ultrapure Water System in Figure 1 of SEMI F61 may be a useful reference for determining sampling points. 2.5 Guides are provided concerning the frequency and location of sampling for those parameters that are not available from on-line analyzers. Frequency of sampling should be based on the specifications set by manufacturing for the quality of the POD UPW, the number and locations of on-line analyzers, the stability of the incoming feed water to the system, and the historical performance of the UPW system over time. 2.6 These guides may also be used"

However this guide was not intended to be identical to or consistent with any other industry document or standard. 3.2 Monitoring and testing of recycled or reclaimed water systems are not specifically addressed in these guides. Additional test parameters, such as quantification and identification of organic species in reclaim water, should be added to monitoring programs for reclaim and reuse waters. 3.3 Measuring the purity of UPW can prove challenging. Many on-line instruments (sodium analyzers, TOC analyzers, silica analyzers, optical particle counters, non-volatile residue analyzers) provide very low limits of detection but may not be capable of being calibrated in the range of detection or may have very poor accuracy at low levels. On-line analyzers should primarily be used for trend analysis. Many tests can still be performed more accurately and reproducibly in a laboratory"

Inorganic carbon as dissolved carbon dioxide $\\left( \\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ , bicarbonate, and carbonate can be present at high ppm levels according to the geology of the water supply. Organic carbon reflects biological input and man-made contaminants such as oils, pesticides, and fertilizers. Ground and well waters normally have significantly lower organic content than surface waters. To remove the majority of organics, most UPW systems employ reverse osmosis; anion exchange resin and ultraviolet (UV) destruction are also employed to remove organics. Some volatile organics, such as trihalomethanes (THM), may be controlled by the use of vacuum degasification. The control of organics is essential for preventing organic fouling and maintaining resin beds at high efficiency.
