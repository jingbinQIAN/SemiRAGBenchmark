The problem of measuring feature sizes on photomasks or integrated circuit wafers (e.g., linewidth) is complicated by the fact that a feature is a 3-dimensional object whose exact shape is generally not known. The metrology problem is further complicated when the object is microscopic and only its magnified image can be measured. 4.2 Feature measurement data are usually reduced to one or a few parameters because the additional data needed to describe the complex actual feature shape are seldom available and may be immaterial to the subsequent application of the measurement data. 4.3 The first rule of metrology is to define exactly what is to be measured. The approach used here, in light of the previous paragraphs, is to construct a simple idealized geometric shape, or feature model (Figure 1), which\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 4  Some Metrology Issues (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 4  Some Metrology Issues\n\nContent: approximates a real object of complex shape. This model, whose size and center position are well defined, is substituted for the real feature in application of the measurement data. A model can be refined to better approximate the actual feature shape by adding degrees of freedom, requiring more parameters to describe the measurement. For example, a line might be represented by a rectangular cross section (with width and height) or better represented by a trapezoidal cross section (with base width, height, and two wall angles). The differences between the model and the actual shape of the feature contribute to the overall measurement uncertainty of the size or position of that feature. 4.3.1 The feature model may be further abstracted to suit the purpose of the measurement by defining bounding boxes to represent the inner and outer limits on the space occupied by the feature. In the nonexistent case of an ideal feature, the feature, the feature model, and the bounding boxes would all coincide. 4.4 The aim of the approach embodied\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 4  Some Metrology Issues (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 4  Some Metrology Issues\n\nContent: here is to facilitate interpretation of metrology results for a feature (and the feature’s subsequent performance — see section A1) in the most realistic terms, and in light of any possible additional knowledge about that feature. 4.5 There are many possible reasons for measuring a feature’s size or placement. Consequently the following definitions may include options or alternatives, to be selected by the user to best fit the purpose of the measurement.\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: 5.1 Defined terms appearing in the definitions of other terms are italicized. Where more than one definition is given for a term, the one most appropriate to the application is to be chosen. Some of these definitions describe certain usage options as “the default.” That option is assumed to apply unless otherwise specified. 5.1.1 bounding box — a user-specified geometric shape with a planar face lying in the reference plane and with user-specified orientation in the reference plane, intended to represent limits or bounds on the position and size of the feature. See Figure 2 for an example. The bounding box need not be rectangular. NOTE 1: The term “bounding box” is used here for convenience, but the word “box” may not always be considered appropriate. Terms like “bounding figure” or “bounding surface” may be used instead, if desired. A bounding box may coincide with a feature model. 5.1.1.1 outer bounding box — smallest bounding box encompassing the feature. 5.1.1.2 best fit bounding box — bounding box best fitting the feature, with\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: user-defined criteria of best fit. 5.1.2 calibration — set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship between values of quantities indicated by a measuring instrument or measuring system, or values represented by a material measure or reference material, and the corresponding values realized by standards [reference Section 6.1]. 5.1.3 centerline — (a) The locus of the centroids of successive line segments, in the limit as the segment length vanishes. $( b )$ a line or surface midway between opposing feature edges. 5.1.4 centroid — The geometrical center of an object. The coordinates of the centroid of an object are $C _ { u } =$ $\\begin{array}{c} \\iiint u d V \\end{array} / \\iint [ d V ,$ where the integral is over the volume $V$ of the object and $u$ can be $x , y$ , or $z$ . 5.1.4.1 centroid measurement uncertainty — parameter that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the position of the centroid or the placement of an object in the reference plane coordinate\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: system (see measurement uncertainty). NOTE 2: The edges of the feature form part of the boundary of the integral defining the centroid; edge position uncertainty leads to integral boundary uncertainty and thus to centroid uncertainty. The centroid measurement uncertainty of a feature described by inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes is the combined uncertainties of the measured centroid position of the mean linewidth bounding box and of the positions of the line’s edges between these linewidth bounding boxes, taking into account possible opposite edge correlations. (These correlations can result in feature placement or pitch uncertainty that is less than the corresponding linewidth uncertainty because many features have some degree of mirror image symmetry between opposite edges.) 5.1.5 feature (lithographic) — region within a single continuous boundary, and attached to a reference plane, that has a defining physical property (parameter) that is distinct from the region outside the boundary. [Adapted from SEMI P28.] NOTE 3: In general a\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: feature is a 3-dimensional object, but some features can be adequately modeled as 2-dimensional objects. 5.1.5.1 feature boundary — surface defined by a userspecified property, such as a threshold, maximum gradient, etc., of the parameter distinguishing that feature from its surroundings. Open features, such as vias or spaces between lines, may be bounded in height by an additional plane parallel to the reference plane. 5.1.5.2 feature edge — that part of the feature boundary used to define the feature size or linewidth. The criteria used must be specified. 5.1.5.3 feature height — dimension of the specified bounding box perpendicular to the reference plane. May also refer to feature depth below the substrate, as in contact holes. Although feature height is sometimes referred to as feature thickness, this usage is not recommended because “thickness” sometimes alludes to “width.” 5.1.5.4 feature model — a solid geometrical shape, with well-defined parameters, e.g., length, width, height, centroid, etc. (Figure 1), meant to approximate the\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: actual shape of a feature boundary. Examples of line edge bounding boxes and the resulting default centerline and linewidth. Since the top of Line A is not parallel to the substrate, the generalized linewidth bounding box definition $( b )$ is used. Line edge asperities at the substrate were judged not to be relevant to the function of this feature and were excluded from the outer line edge bounding boxes. NOTE 4: A rectangular solid is often used to represent a line; a different extruded polygon may better represent the shape of the line. A hemisphere may best represent a solder bump. The more complex the model, more degrees of freedom are available to better fit the model to the feature, and more dimensional parameters are needed to describe the feature’s size. The feature model is a simplified geometric approximation of the actual feature, the bounding boxes represent limits on the space occupied by the feature model. The size or position of a feature can be described by the size or position of the feature model with appropriate\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: uncertainties, or by the sizes or positions of the bounding boxes. This choice is left to the user, and in many of these definitions the terms can be interchanged. Bounding boxes are useful because they make the measurement uncertainty explicit, and because an application of the measurement data may require only inner or outer bounds. 5.1.5.5 feature placement — $( a )$ coordinates describing the position of the centroid of the specified bounding box projected onto the reference plane relative to a coordinate system in that plane. $( b )$ coordinates describing positions of the feature’s edges. 5.1.5.6 feature size — dimensions of the specified feature model or bounding box. 5.1.5.7 nominal feature size — the intended or specified dimension of a feature. Examples of inner, outer, and mean linewidth bounding boxes, and the corresponding default linewidth and pitch. Line edge asperities at the substrate were judged not to be relevant to the function of this feature and were excluded from the outer linewidth bounding box. 5.1.6 line edge\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: bounding $b o x - ( a )$ the region, for each edge, between specified inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes encompassing the edge of the feature. $( b )$ user-specified bounding box intended to encompass the feature edge. See Figure 3. NOTE 5: The underlying concept here is the same as for a feature bounding box; only the perspective is different. If a feature is described using a pair of inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes, then the widths of the corresponding line edge bounding boxes illustrate the component of the linewidth measurement uncertainty arising from the definition of the feature’s edge, and “the linewidth bounding box” describing the feature is taken to mean the mean linewidth bounding box by default. 5.1.7 line edge position — expectation value of the position of the edge within the line edge bounding box used to define the linewidth. If the probability distribution of the edge within the line edge bounding box is symmetric, this will be at the center of the line edge bounding box. 5.1.8 linewidth bounding box — (a) if\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: the feature height is unambiguous, a specified rectangular bounding box constrained to the line height and bounding a specified line length segment; $( b )$ appropriate parameters describing a different bounding box. Additional constraints, such as orientation parallel to a defined length direction, may be placed on the bounding box. See Figure 4. 5.1.8.1 linewidth — (a) width of a specified linewidth bounding box. See Figures 3 and 4. (b) distance between the two opposing line edge positions of a feature. See Figures 5, 6, and 7. NOTE 6: Linewidth is sometimes referred to as critical dimension or CD. 5.1.8.2 best fit linewidth — width of constrained best fit linewidth bounding box. 5.1.8.3 mean linewidth bounding box — a bounding box between inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes, whose right and left edge positions at any height above the substrate are the means of the edge positions of the inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes at that height. See Figues 4 and 5. 5.1.8.4 inner bound linewidth — width of largest linewidth bounding box\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: entirely inside the line segment. Its width is the smallest linewidth that is ordinarily associated with the feature. Example of using rectangular and trapezoidal linewidth bounding boxes to describe Line A in Figure 4. The trapezoidal case requires an additional specification for the linewidth, such as at the distance $\\pmb { h }$ above the reference plane, but it probably better represents the real feature and the width of its line edge bounding box is smaller. 5.1.8.5 outer bound linewidth — width of smallest linewidth bounding box encompassing the line segment. Line edge asperities may reasonably be excluded. Its width is the largest linewidth that is ordinarily associated with the feature. 5.1.8.6 section linewidth — width of the planar rectangle defining the intersection of a linewidth bounding box and a plane parallel to and a specified distance from the reference plane. 5.1.8.7 linewidth measurement uncertainty parameter that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the linewidth of an object\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: (see measurement uncertainty). 5.1.8.7.1 One option here is to choose inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes so that there is a $9 5 \\%$ chance that the line’s true edges lie between them. Then the linewidth measurement uncertainty will be the combined uncertainties of the measured width of the mean linewidth bounding box and of the positions of the line’s edges between these linewidth bounding boxes, taking into account possible right-left edge correlations. This option is the default. 5.1.9 measurand — particular quantity subject to measurement [reference Section 6.1]. 5.1.10 measurement error — result of a measurement minus a true value of the measurand [reference Section 6.1]. NOTE 7: The measurement error is unknown because the true value is unknown. Otherwise there would be no need to measure. Example of linewidth (and spacewidth) after the definition in SEMI P19. Since the intention in this case is to conform to the irregular shape of the edge, the generalized linewidth bounding box definition (b) is used. The inner, outer, and mean\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: linewidth bounding boxes coincide, and the linewidth is defined to be the width of the mean linewidth bounding box at a specified distance $\\pmb { h }$ above the substrate. Alternatively, the line edge bounding box approach can be used here, giving the same results. 5.1.11 measurement uncertainty parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand [reference Section 6.1]. Numerically, it is the square root of the sum of the variances of the probability distributions of all the possible errors (both random and systematic), multiplied by a stated factor chosen to represent the desired confidence interval (usually 2 for $9 5 \\%$ or 3 for $9 9 \\%$ for normally distributed errors), as described in ANSI/NCSL Z540- 2-1997 [reference Section 3.2]. Example of stacked-rectangle linewidth feature model for a chrome photomask line, consistent with common imaging models. For an optical metrology system the stacked rectangles may have different complex\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # 5  Definitions\n\nContent: indices of refraction. For an SEM they may have different atomic numbers.

A1-1.1 Here the process model represents the metrology process. These models are abstractions of the complex realities they represent, a simplification usually required in order to make the modeling tractable and the measurement practical. The output model of this metrology process is the feature model (Section 5.5.4) with the metrology results attached, including the associated measurement uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty arises from inevitable differences between both the process and feature models and their respective realities. The measurement error (Section 5.10) is the difference between the measurement result and the unknown true value, and the measurement uncertainty (Section 5.11) is expressed as a confidence interval representing the variance of the measurement errors. The measurement uncertainty includes components from model infidelity in addition to scale calibration, repeatability, environmental factors, etc. A confidence\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation\n\nContent: interval of $9 5 \\%$ (or $2 \\sigma$ for normally distributed errors) is used in the examples, in accordance with international custom. That is, the likelihood that the true value of the measurand (Section 5.9) lies within the range (measurement result $\\pm$ measurement uncertainty) is $9 5 \\%$ . A1-1.2 A manufacturing process can be represented in a similar manner. In particular, if that process is wafer exposure, then the same feature model for the photomask features can be used for both the mask metrology and exposure processes: exposure model $\\oplus$ photomask feature model $$ wafer feature model. A1-1.3 Errors and uncertainties in the photomask feature model propagate through the exposure model to become manufacturing errors—differences between a wafer feature’s size or placement and its target value— and manufacturing uncertainties. In analogy with measurement uncertainty, tolerances on wafer features encompass mask measurement uncertainties, including differences between the models and\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation\n\nContent: their respective realities, as well as the effects of tolerances for exposure parameters and photomask features. The mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) and other optical proximity effects are good examples of the wafer exposure model operating on photomask feature size and placement variations to produce nonlinear variations in wafer feature size and placement under some conditions. A1-2 Real microlithographic features (Section 5.5) often have irregular shapes and rough edges; it is neither possible nor necessary to know the exact shape of a feature to be measured. The purpose of the feature bounding boxes (Section 5.1) defined here is to account for such edge details as top-to-bottom runout and alongthe-line irregularities that are often observed. In such cases the bounding boxes help define the measurand (Section 5.9). To the extent that such details are not known, not relevant, or too complex to be considered, the bounding boxes represent the feature with a simpler geometry and mix these\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation\n\nContent: disregarded details into the measurement uncertainty. For the ideal line with known edge geometry and no edge irregularities, the inner, mean, and outer linewidth bounding boxes (Sections 5.8.3–5.8.5) can be identical and the line edge bounding box (Section 5.6) can have zero width. The bounding box approach simplifies metrology issues for the quasithin-film features often encountered in microlithography. Extension of the concept to structures with nonplanar top surfaces or extending below the reference plane (Section 5.14) becomes more complicated. A1-3 A great deal of flexibility has been incorporated into some of these definitions. This is because the definition of a measurand (Section 5.9) can depend on the purpose for which a measurement is made, and the measurement error depends on the definition of the measurand. It is up to the user to specify or define the measurand in a way that suits his present purpose and in an unambiguous way. Otherwise interpretation of the measurement result may\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation\n\nContent: be in error and the measurement uncertainty may be meaningless or impossible to ascertain. In other words, the “true values” of feature edge positions, centerline (Section 5.3), centroid (Section 5.4), and linewidth (Section 5.8.1), can depend on the purpose to which the corresponding measurement results are put. The definitions given here allow for some flexibility so they can be made consistent with the ultimate purpose of the measurements. A1-4 The inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes need not have the same shape, but their widths must be unambiguously defined. A rectangular shape for both will result in a centerline, centroid, and linewidth independent of height above the substrate, but may also result in a larger interval between the inner and outer linewidth bounding boxes. The figure $9 5 \\%$ represents 2 standard deviations of the Gaussian probability distribution of possible values for the linewidth. The multiplier value of 2 (the “coverage factor”) is also often used even if the\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation\n\nContent: distribution is not Gaussian [reference Section 3.2], but then the interpretation of $9 5 \\%$ confidence no longer applies. Three standard deviations or some other multiple may be used if so specified. A1-5 The probability distribution and expectation value for the position of an edge within the line edge bounding box are determined as described in ANSI Z540-2 [reference Section 3.2]. Default values for these assume the edge is equally likely to be anywhere inside the line edge bounding box. In that case the expectation value of the line edge location is the center of the line edge bounding box (i.e., the linewidth is the width of the mean linewidth bounding box [Section 5.8.3]), and the edge position uncertainty (at the $9 5 \\%$ confidence level) is $0 . 5 7 7 \\times$ width of line edge bounding box. The corresponding linewidth measurement uncertainty (Section 5.8.7) component is $0 . 8 1 6 \\times$ width of line edge bounding box if the right and left edge location uncertainties are\n\nSEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI P35-0704 TERMINOLOGY FOR MICROLITHOGRAPHY METROLOGY - # A1-1  A metrology process can be represented by the operation\n\nContent: uncorrelated, and $1 . 1 5 4 \\times$ width of line edge bounding box if they are mirror-image correlated (as is often approximately the case). See reference Section 3.2, page 13. A1-6 In most cases, the width or centroid or edge positions of the bounding box is measured from its image in a metrology tool; inferring the width of the bounding box from this image usually requires modeling of the image-forming process. The bounding box should be constructed so that its image in the metrology tool can be modeled with the modeling tools available. If the image is not modeled accurately, additional measurement uncertainty will accrue [reference Section 6.4].

The old format, limited by 16-bit and 32-bit internal integer fields, by its inefficient representation of cell-native geometric figures, and by high structural overhead, was becoming difficult to use for leading-edge designs, and file sizes were becoming unwieldy, in some cases growing to many tens of gigabytes. The successor format was chartered with several overall goals: Achieve at least an order-of-magnitude file size improvement compared to GDSII Stream. Remove all 16-bit and 32-bit integer width restrictions—make the new format fully 64-bit capable. Efficiently represent cells with large payloads of flat native geometric\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: figures. Provide a richer information palette to facilitate interchange of layout-related information between design and manufacturing. 1.2.1 In the months leading up to the formation of the SEMI Data Path Task Force, International Sematech sponsored a series of meetings focusing on Mask EDA issues. Many of the Task Force participants were also involved in these Sematech meetings, and carried forward much useful information from those sessions into the definition of this specification.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This format is designed primarily to encapsulate hierarchical mask layout for interchange between systems such as EDA software, mask writing tools, and mask inspection/repair tools.  \n2.2  This format is designed to be both hardware- and software-independent.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  Use of extension records such as XNAME, XELEMENT, and XGEOMETRY may impair interoperability between tools. It is recommended that these extensions be used primarily for prototyping, and that interoperability be maintained through the formal inclusion of extensions to this specification.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 4.1  IEEE Standards1\n\nIEEE 754-1985 — IEEE Standard for Binary FloatingPoint Arithmetic  \n4.2  ISO Standards2  \nISO-646-IRV — “US-ASCII” Character Set ISO-3309 Information technology Telecommunications and information exchange between systems — High-level data link control (HDLC) procedures — Frame structure\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 4.3  IETF Standards3\n\nRFC 1951 — DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Abbreviations and Acronyms  \n5.1.1  BNF—Backus-Naur Form  \n5.1.2  EDA—Electronic Design Automation  \n5.1.3  4OASISTM—Open Artwork System Interchange Standard\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 5.2  Definitions\n\n5.2.1  Most definitions of terminology specific to OASIS are found within the text of the paragraphs that contain them.  \n5.2.2  cell — a named object in a layout hierarchy, containing native geometric information, annotation information, and/or placements of other cells.  \n5.2.3  geometry — a two-dimensional geometric figure such as a polygon, rectangle, trapezoid, path, circle, etc. with inherent attributes of layer and datatype.  \n5.2.4  placement — a specification by reference that a copy of a cell is to be placed within the coordinate space of another cell at a particular location, orientation, and scale. Cell placement is the fundamental mechanism which makes hierarchy within the OASIS file possible.  \n5.2.5  property — an annotation element consisting of a name plus an optional list of values, supplying descriptive information about the characteristics of the file or one of its components.  \n5.2.6  record — the principal data division in an OASIS file.  \n5.2.7  text element — an annotation element consisting of an (x,y) coordinate point and an associated string.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 5.3  Symbols\n\n5.3.1  “->” — indicates a mapping of an argument to its contents or its meaning.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 6  OASIS Basics\n\n6.1  An OASIS file is a sequence of bytes divided into records. The length of a record is discernible from its structure and is not explicit (in contrast to GDSII Stream, where all record lengths are explicit).  \n6.2  An OASIS file has the following overall syntax (using the modified BNF notation described in Section 36 on page 27). Individual record types appear in bold uppercase and are described in more detail in following sections.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # <oasis-file> $\\mathrm { . > }$ <magic-bytes> START { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | <cell> | <name> }\\* END <name> -> { CELLNAME | TEXTSTRING | LAYERNAME | PROPNAME | PROPSTRING | XNAME } <cell> $\\ J >$ { CELL { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | XYRELATIVE | XYABSOLUTE | <element> }\\* } <element> -> { <geometry> | PLACEMENT | TEXT | XELEMENT } <geometry> -> { RECTANGLE | POLYGON | PATH | TRAPEZOID | CTRAPEZOID | CIRCLE | XGEOMETRY (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # <oasis-file> $\\mathrm { . > }$ <magic-bytes> START { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | <cell> | <name> }\\* END <name> -> { CELLNAME | TEXTSTRING | LAYERNAME | PROPNAME | PROPSTRING | XNAME } <cell> $\\ J >$ { CELL { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | XYRELATIVE | XYABSOLUTE | <element> }\\* } <element> -> { <geometry> | PLACEMENT | TEXT | XELEMENT } <geometry> -> { RECTANGLE | POLYGON | PATH | TRAPEZOID | CTRAPEZOID | CIRCLE | XGEOMETRY\n\nContent: 6.3 An OASIS file may represent a complete layout hierarchy, a portion of a layout hierarchy, or multiple layout hierarchies. These interpretations are not intrinsic to the format and are governed by application semantics only. Each OASIS file must be syntactically complete—it must begin with <magic-bytes> and contain at least a START and END record. 6.4 The <magic-bytes> element is a sequence of 13 ASCII characters: $^ { \\mathfrak { c } \\mathfrak { c } } \\mathtt { S E M I - O A S I S < C R > < N L > } ^ { \\mathfrak { p } }$ where ${ < } \\mathrm { C R } > { < } \\mathrm { N L } >$ represents the ASCII hexadecimal sequence $0 \\mathtt\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # <oasis-file> $\\mathrm { . > }$ <magic-bytes> START { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | <cell> | <name> }\\* END <name> -> { CELLNAME | TEXTSTRING | LAYERNAME | PROPNAME | PROPSTRING | XNAME } <cell> $\\ J >$ { CELL { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | XYRELATIVE | XYABSOLUTE | <element> }\\* } <element> -> { <geometry> | PLACEMENT | TEXT | XELEMENT } <geometry> -> { RECTANGLE | POLYGON | PATH | TRAPEZOID | CTRAPEZOID | CIRCLE | XGEOMETRY (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # <oasis-file> $\\mathrm { . > }$ <magic-bytes> START { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | <cell> | <name> }\\* END <name> -> { CELLNAME | TEXTSTRING | LAYERNAME | PROPNAME | PROPSTRING | XNAME } <cell> $\\ J >$ { CELL { CBLOCK | PAD | PROPERTY | XYRELATIVE | XYABSOLUTE | <element> }\\* } <element> -> { <geometry> | PLACEMENT | TEXT | XELEMENT } <geometry> -> { RECTANGLE | POLYGON | PATH | TRAPEZOID | CTRAPEZOID | CIRCLE | XGEOMETRY\n\nContent: { D } \\ 0 \\mathtt { A }$ .

The low-order byte appears first in the OASIS format. Integer byte length is variable and integers are represented as byte-continuations where the most significant bit of each byte except the last in the chain is a 1; the remaining seven bits in each byte are concatenated to form the actual integer value itself. There are no restrictions on integer byte length (and hence, magnitude). Table 1 Unsigned-Integer Examples 7.2.2 A signed-integer follows the same byte-continuation scheme as an unsigned-integer, and is stored in signedmagnitude form, with the significand left-shifted one bit and the sign bit stored in the least significant bit of the loworder (first) byte. A sign bit of 0 indicates a positive number, and a sign bit of 1 indicates a negative number. Both representations of zero $+ 0$ and $- 0$ ) should be treated as numerically equivalent for the purposes of comparison.

The rational forms are usually more compact than the floatingpoint forms, and have the advantage of being able to precisely represent many values which can only be approximated by the binary floating point representation. The type of representation is stored in an unsigned-integer which precedes the significant portion of the real: Table 3 Real Number Types 7.3.2 In types 0 and 1, the real is a whole number—its fractional portion is zero. In types 2 and 3, the unsignedinteger represents the denominator of a reciprocal, with an implicit numerator of 1. Types 4 and 5 are ratios, with the numerator listed first, followed by the denominator. Types 6 and 7 are binary floating point numbers in IEEE 754- 1985 format, with the least significant byte of the fraction (byte 0) stored first.

A $\\pmb { b }$ -string (“binary string”) is a string which may contain any combination of 8-bit character codes in any sequence. An $\\pmb { a }$ -string (“ASCII string”) may contain only printable ASCII character codes (hexadecimal 21-7E) plus the SP (space) character (hexadecimal 20), in any sequence. An $\\pmb { n }$ -string (“name string”) may contain only printable ASCII character codes (hexadecimal 21-7E), and must have a length greater than zero. 7.4.2 The set of printable ASCII characters consists of hexadecimal character codes 21-7E. In ascending order of character code, we have: $\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\mathrm { ~ ! ~ } ^ { \\mathfrak { n } } \\notin \\mathring { \\lesssim } \\mathring { \\otimes } \\mathfrak { E } ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { ~ ( \\Omega ) ~ } ^ { \\star } + \\mathrm { ~ , ~ - ~ } / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : \\mathrm { ~ ; ~ } < = { > } ? @ } \\\\ & { \\mathrm { ~ \\mathbb { A B C D E F G H I J Z K L M N O P Q R S T U W X Y Z ~ [ \\Omega ] ~ } ^ { \\star } -\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # string $\\Rightarrow$ length byte\\* (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # string $\\Rightarrow$ length byte\\*\n\nContent: } } \\\\ & \\mathrm { ~ a b c d e f g h i j k l m a p q r s t u v w x y z \\{ \\mathrm { ~ | \\Omega ~ \\} \\} ~ ^ { - } ~ } } \\end{array}$ [21-40] [41-60] [61-7E] This excludes space (SP), tabs (HT, VT), and all other control characters. 7.4.3 EXCEPTION HANDLING — OASIS processors should treat illegal characters in $a$ -strings or $n$ -strings as fatal errors. Zero-length $n$ -strings should also be treated as fatal errors. 7.5 Deltas 7.5.1 A delta represents geometric data (coordinates, vectors, planar offsets, etc.). 7.5.2 A 1-delta is stored as a signed-integer and represents a horizontal or vertical displacement. Bit 0 encodes direction: 0 for east or north, 1 for west or south. The remaining bits are the magnitude. Horizontal or vertical alignment is implied by context. 7.5.3 A 2-delta is stored as an unsigned-integer and represents a horizontal or vertical displacement. Bits 0-1 encode direction: 0 for east, 1 for north, 2 for west, and 3 for south. The remaining bits are the magnitude. 7.5.4 A 3-delta is stored\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # string $\\Rightarrow$ length byte\\* (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # string $\\Rightarrow$ length byte\\*\n\nContent: as an unsigned-integer and represents a horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal displacement. Bits 0-2 encode direction: 0 for east, 1 for north, 2 for west, 3 for south, 4 for northeast, 5 for northwest, 6 for southwest, and 7 for southeast. The remaining bits are the magnitude (for horizontal and vertical deltas) or the magnitude of the projection onto the x- or y-axis (for 45-degree deltas). 7.5.5 A $\\pmb { g }$ -delta has two alternative forms and is stored either as a single unsigned-integer or as a pair of unsignedintegers. The first form is indicated when bit 0 is zero, and represents a horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal displacement, with bits 1-3 encoding direction, and the remaining bits storing the magnitude, in the same fashion as a $3$ -delta. The second form represents a general $( \\mathrm { x } , \\mathrm { y } )$ displacement and is a pair of unsigned-integers. Bit 0 of the first integer is 1. Bit 1 of the first integer is the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -direction (0 for east, 1\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # string $\\Rightarrow$ length byte\\* (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # string $\\Rightarrow$ length byte\\*\n\nContent: for west). The remaining bits of the first integer represent the magnitude in the $\\mathbf { x }$ -direction. Bit 0 of the second integer is the y-direction (0 for north, 1 for south). The remaining bits of the second integer represent the magnitude in the y-direction. Both forms may appear in a list of $g$ -deltas.

The initial vertex at $\\mathbf { \\Gamma } ( \\mathbf { x } , \\mathbf { y } )$ is supplied by the POLYGON or PATH record and is not part of the point-list; vertex-count (an unsigned-integer) is the number of points or deltas, excluding the initial vertex and any implicit vertices.

At the beginning of the file, and whenever a CELL or <name> record is encountered, all modal variables with the exception of placement-x, placement-y, geometry- $x$ , geometry-y, text- $x$ , and text- $y$ , are set to a state of undefined; the exceptions just mentioned are set to 0. As various elements appear in the cell’s description, modal variables related to those elements are set from the elements’ definitions. These modal variables can then be used implicitly by successive elements. A modal variable may hold a single value such as geometry- ${ \\bf \\nabla } \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla } w$ , or a multi-variable structure such as a repetition.

A record consists of a single unsigned-integer which encodes the record-ID, followed by the remainder of the record’s descriptive data. In this specification, record-ID values are displayed as decimal numbers enclosed in apostrophes. 11.2 The CBLOCK record is a special case since it encapsulates a series of ordinary records in byte-compressed form. When a CBLOCK record is encountered while reading an OASIS file, it is first necessary to decompress its data, which will produce one or more ordinary records, which can in turn be decoded. For more information on CBLOCK records refer to Section 35 on page 26. 11.3 Most records have an implicit length—the record must be parsed and decoded in order to determine its length. The XNAME, XELEMENT, and XGEOMETRY records are exceptions to this. They encapsulate all of their userdefined data in a single variable-length $b$ -string, so they can be used for prototyping new record types, hiding embedded proprietary data, supporting local\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 11  Records (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 11  Records\n\nContent: non-interoperable extensions, etc. without rendering an OASIS file illegible to older readers, which can simply note the string length and skip over the record. 11.4 EXCEPTION HANDLING — OASIS processors should treat the nesting of a CBLOCK record within another CBLOCK record as a fatal error.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 12  PAD Record\n\n12.1  A PAD record provides a simple way to reserve space within an OASIS file.

It has the following format:\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ] (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ]\n\nContent: 13.2 The version-string is an $a$ -string whose value is “ $1 . 0 ^ { \\dag }$ for this version of the OASIS specification. Version “ $1 . 0 ^ { \\dag }$ corresponds to the OASIS format as described in this document. 13.3 The unit declaration is a positive real number which specifies the global precision of the OASIS file’s coordinate system in grid steps per micron. The OASIS unit value is essentially the reciprocal of the first value in the GDSII Stream UNITS record. 13.4 offset-flag (an unsigned-integer) is 0 when the table-offsets structure is stored in the START record; offsetflag is 1 when the table-offsets structure is instead stored in the END record. The option of storing table-offsets in the END record is provided to make it possible to write an OASIS file sequentially, with no seek-and-update access required, while still providing cell-level random-access capability for subsequent readers of that OASIS file. 13.5 The table-offsets structure consists of 6 pairs of unsigned-integers.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ] (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ]\n\nContent: Each pair consists of a flag field, and a corresponding byte-offset field, in the following order: Table 11 Table Offset Order 13.6 Each of the flag fields is either 1, indicating strict mode, or 0, indicating non-strict mode, for its respective table. The corresponding byte-offset field indicates the position of the first record of its respective table relative to the first byte (byte 0) of the OASIS file. A byte-offset of 0 indicates the absence of that particular table. 13.7 In non-strict mode, records of the corresponding type may occur anywhere in the file, even if some of them have been gathered into a table pointed to by the corresponding byte-offset. 13.8 In strict mode, all records of the corresponding type (plus any associated PROPERTY records) have been gathered into a single contiguous table pointed to by the corresponding byte-offset. PAD records are also permitted in strict mode tables. In addition, strict mode guarantees that all references to the corresponding class of objects\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ] (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ]\n\nContent: (names, strings, or cells) are made exclusively by reference-number. 13.9 When a given strict mode table has been encapsulated within one or more CBLOCK records, the corresponding byte-offset should point to the first byte of the first CBLOCK record containing that table, and the first record of the table must be the first record which appears after decompression of the CBLOCK record. Adherence to this requirement means that it is not permissible to encapsulate more than one strict mode table within a single CBLOCK record, nor is it permissible to begin a strict mode table in the middle of a CBLOCK record. 13.10 EXCEPTION HANDLING — The absence of a START record as the first record in an OASIS file should be treated as a fatal error. A value of unit which is NaN, Inf, or non-positive, should also be treated as a fatal error. When a given table offset is nonzero and the table is flagged as strict, the presence of a “stray” record of that type located discontiguously from its tabular group\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ] (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘1’ version-string unit offset-flag [ table-offsets ]\n\nContent: should be treated as a fatal error, and any records which fail to use reference-number access for that class of objects should be treated as a fatal error. An OASIS reader which does not rely on any of the record grouping, reference-number, and byte-offset guarantees provided by strict mode is not required to detect and report any exceptions related to strict mode.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 14  END Record\n\n14.1  An END record identifies the end of the OASIS file. The END record must be the last record in the file; no trailing bytes are permitted. It has the following format:\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # ‘2’ [ table-offsets ] padding-string validation-scheme [ validation-signature ]\n\n14.2  The presence of the table-offsets structure is governed by offset-flag in the START record (see Section 13 on page 13). The padding-string (a $b$ -string) must be sized and inserted by the OASIS writer so that the total byte length of the END record, including the record- $I D$ , is exactly 256 bytes. This makes it possible for an OASIS reader to find the END record (and any table-offsets and validation-signature) using a relative seek from the logical endof-file, avoiding the need to store a forward pointer in the START record. The contents of padding-string should be initialized to NUL characters.  \n14.3  validation-scheme is an unsigned-integer which selects the validation scheme used, and validation-signature is an optional scheme-dependent group of bytes used for validating the integrity of the OASIS file. The following validation schemes are defined:  \nTable 12  END Record Validation Schemes\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 14.4  CRC32 Validation\n\n14.4.1  The CRC32 polynomial is specified in ISO 3309:  \n$$\n\\mathbf { x } ^ { 3 2 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 2 6 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 2 3 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 2 2 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 1 6 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 1 2 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 1 1 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 1 0 } + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 8 } \\ + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 7 } \\ + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 5 } \\ + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 4 } \\ + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 2 } \\ + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 1 } \\ + \\mathbf { x } ^ { 0 }\n$$  \nWith the left-most bit representing the most significant bit, this corresponds to a value of:  \nbinary  1 0000 0100 1100 0001 0001 1101 1011 0111\nhexadecimal 104c11db7  \n14.4.2  The CRC32 value is computed using all of the bytes in the OASIS file from the first byte of the START record to the END record’s validation-scheme integer. It is byte-order dependent. The resulting 32-bit word is stored in the last 4 bytes of the file, with the least significant byte first. This calculation is usually implemented using a table-lookup shift/XOR method. See Appendix 1 for sample C-language source code.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 14.5  CHECKSUM32 Validation\n\n14.5.1  The CHECKSUM32 validation signature is computed as a simple unsigned arithmetic summation of all of the bytes in the OASIS file from the first byte of the START record to the END record’s validation-scheme integer. This value is then truncated to its least significant 32 bits and stored in the last 4 bytes of the file, with the least significant byte first. It is not byte-order dependent, and this characteristic makes it somewhat easier to calculate if the file is not written sequentially. It is, however, far less effective than CRC32 for detecting errors. See Appendix 1 for sample C-language source code.  \n14.6  EXCEPTION HANDLING — OASIS processors should treat the absence of an END record in an OASIS file as a fatal error.\n\nSEMI P39-0304E2 OASISTM – OPEN ARTWORK SYSTEM INTERCHANGE STANDARD - # 15  CELLNAME Record\n\n15.1  A CELLNAME record associates the name of a cell with a unique reference number.
