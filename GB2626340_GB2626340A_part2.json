At least one of a plurality of solar panels 46 is mounted on the roof and at least one further panel is fixed against at least one side wall. The solar panels comprise a textured, transparent surface to redirect incoming light rays. The panels may extend around a majority of the perimeter of the cabin. The panels may cover the entirety of the roof and may be permanently bonded or adhered flat to the roof and/or side walls. The textured surface may be an undulating and/or macroscopic surface profile with raised portions having a curved or convex surface provided in a regular array. The top layer of the panels may comprise a flexible material such as ETFE. The cabin may comprise an energy store such as a battery, an inverter, a sensor and a controller. At least one drawing originally filed was informal and the print reproduced here is taken from a later filed formal copy.\n\nEco friendly welfare cabin\n\nThe present invention related to a welfare cabin, particularly to a welfare cabin with solar panels. Traditionally welfare cabins are supplied with an integral generator set, i.e. a diesel engine generator, to supply off-grid power to electrical appliances within the cabin. There is an ongoing desire to reduce emissions from combustion engines and to find cleaner alternatives for meeting electrical demands. However the electrical system demands for a welfare cabin can vary significantly, meaning that a peak demand can very quickly outstrip the available renewable power and/or any energy reserves. Conventional renewable energy generators (i.e. solar and wind generators) that can be provided in a practical manner on-board a welfare cabin would fail to cope with even a moderate instantaneous electrical system demand. An on-board energy store is typically provided to ease the need for renewable energy to supply all the immediate energy needs for the cabin. When the inconsistency of renewable energy generation systems is also considered, e.g. due to seasonal variations and immediate weather conditions, this results in conventional renewably charged battery systems being impractical for consistent use. Given that welfare cabins will often need to be used on-site for a period of months, alternative/non-renewable energy sources are relied upon to provide continuous energy availability. However such sources typically increase emissions and add to the carbon footprint of the cabin. They can also significantly increase the frequency of the duty/maintenance cycle for the cabin which adversely affects running costs. In a bid to provide an improved means of providing off-grid power, GB2577142A discloses a unit with a housing, which comprises a base and a plurality faces, wherein a first of the faces is arranged at an oblique angle to the base and is substantially entirely covered by solar panels. The solar panels comprise fixed and movable panels, wherein the unit is configured to have a retracted state and an extended state. In the retracted state, each of the moveable In a bid to provide an improved means of providing off-grid power, panels is arranged to overlap with one of the fixed panels. There is preferably a total overlap of panels in the retracted state so as to minimise the size of the unit for transport or storage. In the extended state, there is preferably no overlap, as shown, so as to maximise the solar capacity. The unit also comprises a backup power generation means which could be a diesel generator or alternatively a fuel cell. GB2586147A aims at offering an improved power system, with increased flexibility, reduced costs and the possibility for retrospective fitting. Disclosed is a welfare cabin with solar panels removably mounted to the cabin. The cabin comprises a pair of spaced and suitably profiled guide rails arranged to slidably receive the solar panel therebetween. The rails are profiled to prevent uplift of the solar panels and to allow a translational sliding movement of the panels so that the panels can be stacked and can slide out to increase the available area for solar generation. A suitable locking arrangement is provided for locking the solar panels in place, i.e. locking them against sliding movement along a channel defined by the guide rails. The varying locations and seasons in the UK mean that no single fixed orientation for the panels is ideal. Installing mountings for solar panels that allow for increasing the surface area of solar panels per cabin are fragile, costly and can cause additional problems when moving the cabins. It will be appreciated that cabins are intended to be moved from site to site in use and so the sites at which the cabin will be used are not known at the point of cabin fabrication. It is an aim of the invention to provide an improved self-contained cabin that resolves or mitigates one or more of the above identified problems. According to the invention, there is provided a self-contained, free-standing welfare cabin as recited in claim 1. The textured solar panels may be fixed against the side walls and roof of the cabin so that the area of the solar panels is greater than that of the cabin roof, i.e. without increasing the footprint of the cabin. Optional features are defined in the dependent claims and within the following detailed description.\n\nDetailed description\n\nPracticable embodiments of the invention are described in further detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which: Figure 1 shows a schematic plan view of a welfare cabin layout; Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a welfare cabin in accordance with an example of the invention; Figure 3 shows a perspective view of the surface of a solar panel according to the invention; Figure 4 shows an exploded view of a solar panel according to the invention; Figure 5 shows an example schematic electrical system for a cabin; The invention focuses on providing a welfare cabin with a bespoke solar panel configuration that is practical to install/manage and specifically suited to the variable locations/conditions that can be experienced on site. Embodiments of the invention also concern the use of efficient electrical systems for providing water heating, air/personnel heating and lighting, e.g. amongst other electrical loads such as cooking appliances and electrical outlets, so that the energy use for the cabin can be met in general by careful control of the electrical system demands relative to the variable renewable energy supply. A free-standing welfare cabin according to an example of the present invention is shown schematically in Figure 1 and generally designated 10. The cabin can be provided in any suitable location, for example, in locations without connection to water or electricity mains. The cabin comprises an outer wall 12 around its perimeter and one or more inner dividing wall 14. The cabin interior is divided by interior walls 14 into separate user rooms/compartments 16, a W/C 18 and an equipment compartment 20. The outer wall 12 provides for a rigid container that is resilient to vandalism. The outer wall may comprise one or more vents to the cabin exterior in any, any combination, or all of the internal compartments. Each of the user compartments 16, 18 and equipment compartment 20 is provided with a door 24 that opens to the exterior of the cabin 10. The doors 24 each have locks and are designed to be resilient to break-in by way of their fitment into the corresponding frame in the outer wall 12, as well as by the nature of the lock. Electrical components within the user compartments comprise a light, personnel sensor and, optionally, a heater. The personnel sensor typically comprises a proximity sensor and/or movement sensor of a known type. A light sensor may also be provided on the interior or exterior of the cabin to sense the level of ambient light. One or more solar panels may be used as a light sensor for light detection, e.g. according to the power output of the solar panel. A suitable air heater may comprise one or more infra-red heating panel (i.e. a radiative heating panel) but could additionally or alternatively comprise an electrical fan heater of conventional type, e.g. a diesel heater, or another convective heater. 25 One or more solar panel (described below) is mounted on the roof of the cabin 10. A plurality of solar panels are typically provided on the roof. Solar panels may cover a majority, or all, of the roof area of the cabin. For example, greater than or equal to 70% of the roof area may be covered; preferably, greater than or equal to 80%. The solar panels may be mounted co-planar with the roof of the cabin (i.e. normally horizontal in use). Solar panel(s) are additionally fitted to the side of the outer wall 12. Such panels are mounted co-planar with the outer wall 12 (i.e. normally vertical in use). In the example of figure 1, the cabin unit 10 is in the form of a larger welfare cabin with the WC 18 and equipment 20 compartments at one end of the cabin 10 and two living/office spaces in thew remainder of the cabin. The user compartments of the cabin 10 could comprise a kitchenette/galley 26, office 28 in addition to the toilet facilities disclosed herein, each separated by internal walls. In other examples, the compartments could comprise a seating/dining area, storage lockers, washing facilities (e.g. a shower/sink). In some embodiments, the kitchenette may comprise a canteen or seating area. In some embodiments, the cabin comprises a drying room (e.g. to dry wet clothes). In a further example, the cabin could comprise a smaller W/C cabin with just one or two compartments providing W/C facilities. All of the cabin options described above are just examples of welfare cabins to which the invention may be applied. It will be appreciated that a variety of welfare cabin layouts may be accommodated to suit different living and working requirements for different numbers of people. In various examples, at least one user compartment 16 would comprise a sink with a water dispenser 30 (e.g. a tap or hot wash unit) to provide hot or cold water and a toilet fed by an on-board water system.\n\nArrangement of solar panels on the cabin\n\nFigure 2 shows a perspective view of a welfare cabin in accordance with an example of the invention. The cabin 10 comprises a roof 201 and a plurality of side walls 202. The entire outer wall 12, or perimeter of the cabin, is the combined external sides of the plurality of side walls 202. The cabin shown in figure 2 is a rectangular box shape with four side walls, however, the cabin may be of any suitable shape with any suitable number of side walls. Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a welfare cabin in accordance with an The side walls 202 comprise an upper end 203 located towards the roof 201 of the cabin 10 and a lower end 204 located towards the ground on which the cabin 10 is located. Solar panels 46 are fitted to the roof 201 and the upper end of the side walls 202. The upper end of the side walls may constitute a region in the upper half, third or quarter of the height of the side wall. The solar panels 46 may extend up to the upper edge of the side walls 102, e.g. terminating at or adjacent the upper edge. The roof 201 of the cabin 10 is flat and substantially horizontal relative to the ground on which the cabin is located. The side walls 202 of the cabin 10 are flat and substantially vertical relative to the ground on which the cabin is located. The solar panels 46 on the roof 201 and the upper ends 213 of the side walls 202 provides the cabin with horizontally and vertically disposed solar panels 46. The side walls 103 may comprise one or a plurality of doors 24, windows, vents, or any other typical fixings typically found on welfare cabins. The solar panels 46 are located around said fixings. Preferably no fixings would be provided on the roof 201 and upper ends 203 of the side walls 202 such that these are covered in their entirety in solar panels 46. The solar panels 46 may cover a majority of the roof 201 area of the cabin 10, for example, greater than or equal to 70% of the roof 201 area may be covered; preferably, greater than or equal to 80% or 90%. In this example, the solar panels 46 on the side walls 202 are located side by side, at the same height on the upper end 203 of the side wall 202, e.g. with no gap between each solar panel across the entire width of the upper ends 203 of the side walls 202. The solar panels 46 on the side walls 202 could alternatively be provided intermittently across the upper ends 203 of the side walls 202 to cover a majority of the width/length of the side walls 202 of the cabin. For example, the solar panels may cover greater than or equal to 70% of the width of the upper end 203 of the side walls 202 or the perimeter of the cabin, preferably greater than or equal to 80% or 90%. The solar panels 46 may be located at the upper ends 203 but not at the uppermost end of the side walls 202, providing a gap between the solar panels 46 located on the roof 201 and the solar panels 46 located on the side walls 202. The solar panels 46 may extend the entire length of the side walls 202 in sections of the cabin 10 where this does not obscure any of the cabin’s external fixtures or fixings. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to provide windows towards the upper end 103 of the side walls 102. The solar panels are fixed flat to the side walls 202, and optionally the roof, of the cabin 10. In the example shown in figure 2 the solar panels 46 are bonded to the side walls 202. The solar panels 46 are bonded such that attempts to remove the panels will irrecoverably/irreversibly damage the panels. The solar panels 46 on the roof 201 may be mounted co-planar with the roof 201 of the cabin 10 normally (i.e. horizontally in use). The solar panels 46 may also be fixed flat to the roof 201. The solar panels 46 may be fixed to the roof 201 using fixings/brackets and/or may be bonded to the roof in a manner akin to the side walls. In some examples, the roof may have a corrugated form or may otherwise have channels for directing rainwater. In such examples, the solar panels may be fixed to the roof over such channels, e.g. so the panel is generally flat despite the roof being profiled and so that the channels are unobstructed. In some embodiments, the solar panels 46 on the roof 201 are angled from the horizontal. The solar panels 46 on the roof 201 may be angled at an optimum angle for solar collection for a particular location. In some embodiments, the solar panels 46 on the roof 201 may be mounted via a simple mechanism to allow adjustment of the angle thereof. As the optimum angle varies due to time of year, the mechanism may be capable of placing the solar panels 46 on the roof 201 at the most efficient angle for a given time. The adjustable mechanism comprises pivot or other rotatable mechanism to provide tilting of the solar panels 46 relative to the plane of the roof 201. For example, the solar panels 46 on the roof 201 can both pivot about a horizontal axis and swivel about a vertical axis. The solar panels 46 are electrically connected to the interior of the cabin. An electrical connection may be provided by a cable which passes from the exterior the cabin 10 through a gland and into the interior of the cabin 10. The gland provides a water-tight fitting to pass the cable from the exterior to the interior. The cabin may only have a single gland and all the solar panels 46 provided on the cabin 10 are in electrical connection with one another such that only one cable is required to pass from the exterior of the cabin 10 to the interior of the cabin. Alternatively, there may be multiple glands provided on the cabin 10, each for receiving a cable, each cable being electrically connected to one or more solar panels 46. 15 20 The electrical connection of the panels in a side-by-side configuration on the exterior of the cabin removes the need to accommodate junction boxes, or similar electrical connectors, on the rear surface of the panels and also removes the need to provide access to the rear of the panels at all. As such, the panels can be permanently fixed flat against the side walls and roof of the cabin with no access to the rear of the panel that could serve to allow unauthorised removal of the\n\nSolar panel texture and structure\n\nFigure 3 shows a perspective view of the surface of the solar panel 46 according to the invention. The solar panel 46 comprises a textured surface. The surface of the solar panel comprises a plurality raised portions 301. The raised portions 301 having a convex surface, the base shape of the raised portions are circular in plan but can be any suitable shape, for example rectangular, oblong or elliptical. The texture of the surface is macroscopic, e.g. comprising readily discernible variations in the surface that are on a length scale of the same order as the overall thickness of the panel. The raised portions 301 may each having a width/diameter in the range of 1- 20mm. The width of the individual raised portions may be greater than or equal to 2mm, 3mm, 4mm or 5mm. The width of the raised portions may be less than 20mm, 15mm or 10mm. The overall thickness of the panel may be in the region of 2-5mm, e.g. in the region of 3mm. The raised portions may have a height of around 1mm. In various embodiments, the raised portions may have a height that is within 1/5 and 1/2 of the overall height of the panel. In this example, the raised portions 301 are provided in a regular pattern covering the entirety of the surface of the solar panel 46. The raised portions 301 are spaced in rows across the surface of the solar panel 46, e.g. in a two dimensional array of rows and columns. The spacing between the raised portions may be similar to, or the same as, the width of the raised portions described above. The spacing may be slightly less than the width of the raised portions, e.g. in the region of 1-5mm. The peak to peak spacing of the raised portions may also be similar to, or the same as, the width of the raised portions described above. 20 In the space between is an indented portion 302 which lies substantially flat on the surface of the solar panel 46. The indented portion 302 may comprise a concave shape. The raised portions 301 may be provided across the solar panel 46 in an irregular pattern or may only be provided in discrete areas of the solar panel 46, for example, only located above each solar cell 303 within the solar panel 46. The surface profile may follow a repeating pattern of peaks and troughs when viewed in section in the lateral or longitudinal directions through the protrusions. The profile is undulating and may approximately follow the shape of a wave form, e.g. being generally sinusoidal in form. The raised portions 301 create a texture on the surface of the solar panel which has the effect of redirecting unfocussed/incident light, such as sunlight, onto the solar cells within the solar panel to improve solar panel efficiency. Alternatively to the textured surface described above, the shape of the raised portions may be any suitable shape which would redirect an incoming light ray, for example, a prism. Figure 4 shows an exploded view of the solar panel 46 according to the invention. The solar panel 46 comprises ten layers. The first/top layer 401 of the solar panel comprises a flexible material. The first layer is pressed to create the surface texture of the solar panel 46 as detailed above. In this example, the first layer 401 comprises ETFE but could be made from any suitable transparent, plastics/polymer material. A suitably shaped press may impart the desired surface profile on the top layer during manufacture, e.g. with the material of the first layer at elevated temperature. The solar panel construction beneath the top layer is of uniform depth. As such the variation in height of the top layer causes the varying height of the overall panel. Incident sunlight will be refracted by the top layer onto the solar cells. Below the first layer 401 there is the second and third layers 402. The second and third layers 402 each comprise a sheet of EVA. These provide a barrier between the first layer 401 and the solar cells 303 which comprise the fourth layer. The fifth, sixth and seventh layer 403, each comprising EVA are provided below the layer of solar cells 303. The layers of EVA above and below the solar cells enable the solar cells to soften shocks and vibrations, protecting the solar cells 303 and their circuits the durability and performance of solar panels 46. The eighth layer 404, ninth layer 405, and tenth layer 406 together comprise the backsheet of the solar panel 46. The backsheet is what protects the solar cells 303. In this example, the eighth layer 404 comprises either aluminium or fiberglass, the ninth layer 405 comprises EVA and the tenth layer 406 comprises TPT. The backsheet has high weather-resistance, high mechanical strength and low permeability. The backsheet may comprise any number of layers and materials which provide protection to the solar cells without compromising the weight and flexibility of the solar panel 46. The outer surface of the backsheet, i.e. the rear surface of the panel, may be roughened/textured or otherwise treated for bonding to the cabin. Unlike the macroscopic surface texture of the upper surface of the solar panel, any roughened surface texture of the rear surface will typically be microscopic in form. An intermediate binding layer could be provided on the backsheet or at the interface between the backsheet and the outer surface of the cabin during The overall thickness of the solar panel is in the range 2.5mm to 5mm.\n\n15 Solar panel operation\n\nThe redirecting of light onto the solar panel by way of the textured surface has been found to be particularly beneficial for welfare cabin applications. This is because there are a number of factors affecting the solar generation capacity of a cabin, including the precise latitude of the cabin, the time of year (daylight hours) and the orientation of the cabin on site. As such, an optimal inclination of the solar panels for any one time of year at any one location or orientation would not be optimal at other times and in other locations. Without needing to adjust the inclination of solar panels on the roof of the cabin for a given site, use of panels on the cabin with a surface texture suitable for redirecting incident light, has been determined to provide surprisingly good all- round performance. Horizontal panels perform better in summer months when the sun is higher in the sky, whilst vertical panels perform better in winter months when the sun is lower. The addition of the surface geometry described herein means that the panel can present a greater surface area to the sun at a relative inclination and can redirect incident light onto the solar cells. Solar panels provided on the roof of the cabin may be adjusted to optimal orientation to increase performance. However it has been found that this additional complexity may not be necessary for a sustainable solar cabin. A simpler solar panel mounting and welfare cabin construction can be implemented for all-year use in varying locations without the need for panel deployment mechanisms. Also the available area for solar panel installation is increased beyond the area of the roof without increasing the footprint of the cabin. The fact that the cabin may be located in areas of low light and/or low sun elevation conditions, as such, with increased solar panel efficiency is advantageous. Use of textured surface panels on the side walls of the cabin in permanently fixed vertical orientations also provides a system that is potentially vandal-proof and easy to install.\n\nElectrical system\n\nFigure 5 shows a schematic of the electrical/control system onboard the cabin, which comprises a controller 60 provided as one or more processor or logic circuit in communication with the sensors described herein and arranged to output control signals to the various electrical components of the electrical system. The electrical system is powered by the energy store 50 which takes the form of one or more battery, e.g. a battery bank. The electrical system comprises AC and DC systems/circuits, labelled 32 and 34 respectively. The AC system may be a 230V system and/or the DC system may be a 12V, 24V or 48V system. However alternative voltages may be provided to suit local requirements in different countries, e.g. on the understanding that the DC system will be of lower power rating than the AC system. The AC circuit 32 allows use of conventional AC appliances in the cabin and may have electrical sockets for connection of such appliances. Charging and discharging of the energy store 50 may be controlled by the controller 60. The energy store 50 may provide the sole or primary source of electrical power for the cabin, i.e. for the appliances on the AC 32 and/or DC 34 circuits. A DC-AC converter/inverter 36 is provided as part of the power control system. The inverter is used to covert DC power from the batteries, and/or solar panels, to provide power to the AC system. In the present embodiment, the inverter 36 is “under-rated”. The inverter is therefore not sufficiently rated to power all the AC appliances concurrently. For example, the inverter may provide a 3kW output, whereas the sum total of the AC appliances is greater, e.g. 10kW. The power rating of the inverter is such that it is sufficient to run the most power-intensive component in the system. The power rating of the inverter may be greater than or equal 1kW; preferably 2kW. The power rating of the inverter may be less than or equal to 5kW. In various embodiments, the inverter 36 is only selectively activated. For example, the inverter may be powered down entirely, i.e. so that it does not draw power, based on readings of cabin occupancy and/or power demand on the AC circuit. A water heater may be provided on the AC 32 circuit and/or DC 34 circuit. In this example both an AC and DC water heaters are provided and the controller 60 can switch either/both on/off as required. Those water heaters may allow for different power output, e.g. to permit different rates of heating such as instant and/or longer term hot water heating for a hot water tank. In this regard, the cabin 10 may comprise a hot water tank, i.e. separate from a fresh water tank. 30 comprise a hot water tank, i.e. separate from a fresh water tank. Although not shown in the figures, it will be appreciated that a hot water tank, or instant hot water heating system, will comprise a water temperature sensor in communication with the controller 60. The current temperature reading can be used to determine whether the water temperature is acceptable (i.e. to prevent overheating and/or to alter the priority of water heating within the control logic). The solar panels 46 and battery bank 50 are connected to the DC circuit. DC power is generally provided to any DC appliances by the battery 50. The DC output of the solar panels 46 can thus be used to charge the battery 50 viaa battery charger 66. The battery charger 66 comprises a charge controller, e.g. to monitor the level of charge on the battery and selectively disconnect the battery when a maximum charge level is reached. The battery charger 66 may optionally comprise a DC-to-DC converter/regulator. The appliances connected to the battery on the DC circuit comprise: the interior and/or exterior light(s); the water pump(s); DC sockets (such as USB/charging sockets); and, optionally, a DC water heater or DC generator, if used. Any of the lighting and/or heating appliances could be controlled at least in part in accordance with the output of the one or more motion/proximity sensor. Each appliance is connected to the system via a PIR sensor. In some embodiments, one or more instantaneous water heater(s) is provided for the wash basins or sinks. An individual electrical water heater may be provided for each sink in the cabin. In other embodiments, an electric heated water storage tank may be fitted in order to provide the hot water for the hand wash sink(s). The sink is fitted with non-concussive taps 30 so that water usage is kept toa minimum. The hot water tank would be managed by the controller 60 so that it is kept topped up and only heated when necessary. A water level and/or temperature sensor may be provided in communication with the controller 60 for this purpose. The control system may be configured to prevent frost damage, e.g. by monitoring water temperature against a minimum threshold temperature (i.e. above freezing) and using a small amount of power to maintain a temperature within the water system. The system may detect whether a user (e.g. a person) is inside the cabin. For example, the cabin may comprise an infra-red sensor. If a user is not within the cabin, then the water heater may be deactivated to save energy. The heater may be deactivated after a predetermined period of time. For example, the heater may be deactivated after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or 60 minutes. When a user enters the cabin, the heater is re-activated accordingly. The pressure for the water taps may be provided by an accumulator to store pressure. When the pressure drops the control system 60 will run the water pump 56 until the pressure reaches the desired level. A water pressure sensor or water pressure switch may be provided in communication with the controller 60 for this purpose. The lighting inside the cabin is low wattage DC LED lighting consuming minimal power, it is controlled so that it only illuminates when there is someone present (according to the output of sensor or a door opening sensor) and there is insufficient natural light (according to a comparison of the output of sensor with a minimum threshold value of ambient light). The control system may also switch off the internal light after a set time of operation to conserve energy, e€.g. a period for which the presence of a person within the cabin is not detected. The external lighting is low voltage DC LED lighting consuming minimal power, it is controlled so that it only illuminates when there is someone present and there is insufficient natural light (i.e. determined according to the relevant sensor outputs in a manner akin to the internal lighting control). The control system also turns it off after a set time to conserve energy. Personnel/space heating is controlled so that it only operates when the ambient temperature is below a predetermined threshold and someone is present. Thus an ambient temperature sensor may be provided inside the cabin and may be used by the control system in conjunction with one or more personnel sensor described herein to control operation of the heater automatically. The heating will turn off once there is no longer anyone present in the cabin. The heating can be DC or AC (e.g. 12V or 230V). If the heating is 230V the power could be provided from the DC energy store via an inverter for a more-limited period of time. The heating may be provided by an electric, resistive element (e.g. including a fan) heater or infra- red heating panels. An electric heat exchanger style air heater may be used, e.g. akin to air conditioning units due to its potential efficiency. This could run from the battery. In some examples, a diesel powered heater could be used, e.g. in conjunction with a particulate filter in the exhaust path to mitigate emissions. In use, the power for the electrical system is stored in the batteries 50, which are charged up predominantly by the solar panels fitted to the roof and side of the cabin 10. The batteries are most likely Lithium-ion batteries, but lead acid or gel batteries may be used in the same way only with a reduced power density. Any conventional electrical energy store could be used. If for any reason the battery charge level drops too low the load is switched off by the controller 60 to prevent the batteries being deep discharged. A dedicated load shedder could be fitted to the batteries in other examples, if desired. The charge on the battery 50 is used to power the electrical system. The system can operate for extended periods of time via the battery bank 50 alone, i.e. being charged by the available renewable energy generator. Different renewable energy sources, designated as solar panel(s) 46a, wind turbine(s) 46b and hydropower 46c can be connected to the battery pack 50 each by a suitable charge controller 66. 25 30 The control system 60 monitors the charge level on the battery pack 50 and controls delivery of power to the AC and/or DC circuits. The control system 60 monitors the load on the AC and/or DC circuits and operates according to control algorithms for managing the efficiency of energy use/supply. The electrical system is managed with an intelligent load management system that is configured so that when more appliances are being asked to run than there is available power (e.g. based on current and/or predicted energy store levels) then the load management system may limit the maximum power supply to the electrical system. To this end, In any examples of the invention, the control system 60 comprises one or more sensor indicating the current level of charge and/or available capacity for energy storage. The sensor output is communicated to the controller such that it can be accommodated in power supply decisions made by the controller. The controller in presently preferred embodiments is pre-programmed with a prioritisation algorithm which dictates a preferential supply of power to certain appliances over others. Each electrical load/appliance may thus be given a ranking of 1-n, where ‘n’ is the number of electrical appliances connected to the electrical system. Using this technique, each appliance has a ranking that can be used to determine which appliance(s) should be powered in the event that it is not possible to supply power to meet all the instantaneous or planned electrical loads on the system. The controller 60 comprises one or more routine/algorithm to determine whether the level of charge on the battery and the concurrent power suppled form the renewable energy source is sufficient to meet the electrical demand on the system. The control system may check the instantaneous power supplied by the solar panels (and/or other renewable energy source) to determine whether the demands of the concurrent electrical loads on the system can be met. The controller 60 may monitor the current rate of charge on the battery and the current rate of discharge from the battery to meet the electrical demands of the connected appliances. Thus rather than monitoring the solar panel power output per se, the controller could simply monitor the charge level on the battery and/or the rate of charge/discharge from the battery. In this regard, the controller may only need to receive the relevant sensor inputs (being indicative the appliances to be activated) and the level of charge on the battery in order to make instantaneous power supply decisions. This provides a simple but highly effective and efficient control strategy. In a simple example, this may involve monitoring the rate of depletion of the charge on the battery 50 and sending an alert signal or denying power to certain appliances whenever the charge on the battery 50 drops below a minimum threshold and/or the rate of depletion in charge level on the battery is greater than a maximum threshold. The electrical system is configured to ensure the power drawn through the inverter is less than or equal to the rated power (i.e. to prevent overloading thereof). In the event the total power demand through the inverter (e.g. on the AC circuit) exceeds the power rating thereof, the system is configured to selectively deny power to one or more appliance such that the power demand is less than or equal to the power rating of the inverter. Additionally or alternatively, the controller may selectively start a generator or backup power source to supply power without the need to prevent exceeding the rated power of the inverter, The system may operate in a similar fashion to described above and like features will not be repeated for the sake of brevity. Power to or through the inverter may be reduced or prevented (i.e. the inverter may be electrically isolated in one or more conditions) to avoid the inverter drawing residual power when not supplying any appliances. The conditions may include where a user is not detected within the cabin. This helps to reduce power consumption. Power to the inverter may be reduced/prevented after a predetermined period of time when no occupancy of the cabin is sensed. For example, the inverter may be deactivated after 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or 60 minutes. When a user enters the cabin, the inverter is re- activated accordingly. A similar regime may apply to one or more appliances in the cabin. Isolation of the inverter may be performed using a controller comprising one or more of: a relay; a current sensing relay; a programmable logic circuit (PLC); and/or artificial intelligence system. The controller may be integral with the inverter and/or form part of an overall power management system. In some embodiments, the system may be configured to provide an alarm to send an alert to a remote device (e.g. a mobile phone) in the event the appliances exceed a predetermined demand and/or the battery falls below predetermined level. The controller 60 may undergo: (1) profiling of electrical demands for the system as a whole and/or individual electrical alliances; and, (2) receiving forecasts of environmental conditions that affect renewable energy generation. The profiling of electrical demands, at least in part, takes the form of scheduling periods of usage and non-usage of the cabin. When a cabin is deployed to a site, or in advance of a planned deployment, an operator may input the intended operational schedule for the cabin in terms of working and non-working days and/or the hours of each working day for which the cabin is to be used. The operational schedule preferably extends at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks into the future such that there is a predictable plan for cabin usage. Even using this basic information an initial profile of energy usage for the cabin can be implemented based on historic knowledge of similar cabin types or the same cabin used in different/previous locations. For example, a basic or generic profile of power consumption by the cabin electrical system as a whole can be established by the control system showing a non-constant power usage over the working day (usage hours) and/or a minimal power consumption over non-usage time periods. For example, power usage during working hours may show initial peaks at the start of a shift and during break/meal times as well as an ongoing background usage for lighting, space heating, water pump, water heating, hand drying, etc. The number of cabin occupants may also be input during setup to contribute to predicted profile of power consumption for the cabin. A greater number of occupants may imply more frequent use of certain appliances and/or a larger number of concurrent electrical appliances being used. The controller 60 is thus programmable to recurring schedules or other predictable or cyclic events/behaviour. For example schedules may be used to follow trends in energy consumption and/or renewable energy availability. Daily, weekly, monthly and/or seasonal schedules may be used. For example, it may be assumed that the cabin may not be used overnight or at weekends in some instances of use and so a low level of charge on the battery may be sufficient. However scheduling of energy consumption may imply that high levels of energy consumption are expected during the working hours of a morning/afternoon. As such the renewable energy generator(s) may be sufficient to top up the battery over a weekend, implying that the generator set is not required to be used merely because a low charge level exists on the battery at the start of a weekend. Environmental condition forecast data may be received by the control system through a suitable subscription service, e.g. via an API. Data may be received over a conventional wired or wireless signal connection, e.g. satellite and/or mobile telephony networks. The control system may have a SIM card and receiver circuit to this effect. Certain environmental condition data may be logged for the control system well in advance, e.g. daylight hours, such that it does not need to be transmitted to the control system. The received environmental condition data, e.g. weather forecast data, are used to indicate when renewable energy may be sufficient to meet demands in advance. The environmental condition data may be specific to a given location (e.g. GPS location) of the cabin on-site. The data may comprise any, or any combination of: daylight hours; ambient temperature; ambient light level (sunlight/cloud-cover); precipitation/humidity data; and/or wind speed. The location of the cabin (latitude and longitude) may be manually entered or else may be tracked by the control system, e.g. via GPS, and sent to the subscription service to obtain data applicable to the current cabin location. Based on the received data, the controller determines an energy generation capability of the renewable energy generator(s) 46 for a scheduled time period. Like the energy demand of the system, this is determined as a varying profile over the time period based on the varying environmental condition data. This can be plotted on a timeline. For a predetermined time period the controller can thus take the current level of charge on the battery bank 50 and can plot both the supply to the battery as well as the demand/drain from the battery using the combination of renewable energy generation profile and the energy system demand profile described above. The controller can thus determine whether a minimal battery charge threshold will be met at any time during the predetermined period. In the event that the controller determines that the battery will discharge to an unacceptable level (i.e. beyond a minimum threshold) at one or more point during the scheduled time period, the controller may determine the level of intervention needed to avoid crossing the relevant threshold. This may involve denying power to one or more electrical appliance for a period of time according to the control hierarchy. Additionally or alternatively, this may involve outputting an alert signal to an operator of the cabin indicating that a power demand may not be met. The signal may be a message to a portable communication device of the operator and/or an information system within the cabin, e.g. a screen or similar indicating scheduled periods of power availability for different appliances. A remote cabin operator may receive the alert on a computing device and may log the alert or else control operation of the cabin remotely, i.e. approving or denying the intended control system measures. Where the charge on the battery pack is insufficient, any backup power source 52, 54, 56, 58 could be connected/used to supply power to the system. Those backup options comprise a further renewable energy source 52 (e.g. wind turbine or additional solar panels), an internal/external generator set 54, a grid power supply 56 and/or external battery pack 58. Any, any combination, or all backup options could be used where needed, although in many examples, e.g. in systems where fewer or lower-power electrical appliances are used, the backup options could be negated altogether, or used in an ad-hoc fashion, only where an alert is sent out by the control system 60. The control system 60 monitors and manages the battery charge level and, if insufficient charge is created from the solar panels 46, then the batteries 50 can be topped up with power from the backup source. If the battery charge level drops below a certain level (i.e. a minimum threshold) the backup source can automatically be switched on (if connected) and operated until the batteries are sufficiently/fully charged. The system also allows for numerous improved reporting and control options for the user/operator. In any examples of the invention, the system controller 60, or another data controller of the system, may transmit data relating to the cabin electrical system to a remote server or facility for access by individual users. The data may be accessed or transmitted to users having management/monitoring privileges. Such users may access the data and information/reports using any suitable conventional computing devices, such as PCs, laptops/tablets, mobile phones, and the like. The user may access any or any combination of the following information in the form of numerical data entries, charts/graphs, reports or alerts (e.g. when one or more threshold criterion is met): e Battery levels ¢ Daily/hourly power gained from solar panels ¢ Daily/hourly power consumption of the cabin e The usage of each electrical item, time of day used, duration it is used for and/or how much power it consumed. A current and/or historical report may identify each electrical appliance and its availability status, e.g. whether it is available for use or whether it has been ‘disconnected’ due to one of the low charge level limits of the battery. The same sort of communication facility for users may allow transmission of user settings/instructions to the system, e.g. allowing a managing user to set one or more energy usage threshold for the cabin and/or individual appliances or appliance types. For example a user could set times of the day in which certain appliances can be used, hourly/daily/weekly usage or energy consumption limits and the like. This functionality may be used during setup of the cabin ready for use, e.g. in advance, or else during use of the cabin, e.g. in reaction to cabin operation, weather conditions and/or the availability of another electrical energy source. The notification/data from the controller to a remote management/monitoring device may comprise one or more of: e A battery charge level and/or charging/discharging rate. The system may notify the remote device in the event the battery falls below a predetermine charge level. e A location of the cabin. The cabin comprises a location system (e.g. The system may notify the remote device in the event is outside a predetermined location or area (e.g. outside a geofenced area). e Whether one or more component of the system is powered down. e Detected occupancy of the cabin and/or when an absence of a user is determined. e Current power and/or total charge (e.g. over the day or hour-by-hour) generated by the solar panels. e Power usage on the AC and/or DC circuit. e Electrical diagnostics and/or conditions of the system. The use of a the solar panel arrangement as described above in conjunction with a control system of the type described above allows a cabin to be powered only by solar panels for an indefinite period of time with added certainty and control when compared to renewable energy systems onboard welfare cabins according to the prior art. The invention may also allow a relatively long service interval, by avoiding use of a combustion-based generator set thereby reducing a significant ongoing cost in maintaining welfare cabins. The cabin has been developed to give people energy efficient living/working facilities on sites where there is typically no available mains power or where it is desirable to reduce use of non-renewable energy sources.\n\nClaims:\n\n.
