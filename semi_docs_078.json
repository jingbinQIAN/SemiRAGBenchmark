The evaluation consists of the measurement of charge injected before the dielectric breakdown of the MOS capacitors. To measure the injected charge, voltage applied to a MOS capacitor is controlled so that the current is kept constant. The applied voltage is monitored throughout the test, and the time to sudden voltage drop which results from dielectric breakdown of the silicon dioxide film is measured. The amount of the injected charge is the product of the measured time and gate current density. The defect density of the oxide film is evaluated from the Weibull plot (cumulative failure rate) of the dielectric breakdown data of approximately 100 MOS capacitors. 5.4.2 Stress Current Density — For reliable measurement, a voltage/current source with a stable output wave shape shall be used.

In the constant current TDDB measurement, a constant current is continuously applied, and voltage is monitored. The dielectric breakdown is judged by a sudden drop in the voltage monitored. If the applied stress current density is too low, the time to breakdown will be too long to be realistic. Contrarily, too a high current density is also unsuitable because the voltage drop in the oxide breakdown instant becomes small. Considering these factors, the recommended stress current density range is from 0.01 to $0 . 1 \\mathrm { A } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ . 5.5 Measurement Temperature — Besides current density, the measurement temperature is also an important parameter which determines measurement time.

In addition, there are cases that since silicon wafer, stage chuck, probe, and so on, expand at a high temperature, the probe deviates from the predetermined position, thus consideration is required when selecting probing machines. 5.6 Breakdown Judgment — To measure the dielectric breakdown lifetime of an oxide film, the voltage applied to a MOS capacitor is controlled so that a current is kept constant. The applied voltage is monitored throughout the test. The dielectric breakdown of the oxide is judged by sudden voltage drop. In practice, at the dielectric breakdown the applied voltage becomes lower than the criterion voltage defined before. The dielectric breakdown lifetime is the stress application time till breakdown. If the criterion voltage is too low, it can easily affected by noise. In contrast, the chance of missing breakdown events is increased if the criterion voltage is too high."

Measurement conditions shall be optimized for each purpose. For TDDB, an average electric field of approximately $1 0 { \\mathrm { M V / c m } }$ is required. Therefore, the effective electric field applied to an oxide film is influenced by a series resistance. Thus, the constant current TDDB is more suitable.

This reason is because the oxide characteristics depend on the fabrication processes. If MOS capacitors would be formed with different fabrication processes, it is desirable to confirm that these GOI results are similar to those of the MOS capacitors formed by the fabrication processes described above. Particularly, the electrode material of the MOS capacitors has a great influence on the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide. Poly-silicon is specified as the electrode material in this standard.

That is, too a high current density leads to nonuniform stress on gate oxide. As a result, the reliability of the measurement is reduced. The gate oxide with a defect density is able to be evaluated using two sets of MOS capacitors. Although the gate area and total number of MOS capacitors have the same product, one set consists of many capacitors with a small gate area and the other set consists of a few of capacitors with a large gate area. The TDDB evaluations using the former are more desirable than those using the latter. In this round robin, where a polycrystalline silicon thickness is $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ , sheet resistance is $5 0 \\Omega / \\bigsqcup$ and gate area is smaller than $5 \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ , reasonable TDDB results were obtained."

There must be no dielectric film on the back surface, e.g., silicon oxide, in order to effectively apply a voltage bias to the gate oxide. It is not necessary for this to be carried out with a metallic contact on the back surface of the wafer under test. However, when the vacuum chucking is weak, care must be taken because of the possibility that the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide is not accurately judged due to an increase in parasitic resistance. It is strongly suggested that testing be carried out with a current polarity such that the silicon surface will be in accumulation below the gate oxide, that is, negative voltages for $p$ -type silicon wafers. If the polarity of the voltage is chosen to be in the reverse direction, the breakdown voltage may not be accurately measured due to the presence of a depletion layer below the gate oxide."

It is possible that rapid voltage changes at the dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide cause electrical noise. There is a possibility that this noise leads to misjudgments of the oxide breakdown. So it is desirable to confirm that oxide breakdown occurred. For example after the TDDB measurement has been completed, the samples are measured to confirm their insulation.

There are COPs or oxygen precipitates other than particles, alkaline and metallic contamination at the Si surface of the MOS capacitors in this category.  Classification of this mode with the following A-B mode is performed at a small amount of injected charge, $\\mathrm { \\Delta Q _ { a } } ,$ as illustrated in Fig RI-2.  For example, the classification charge, $\\mathrm { \\Delta Q _ { a } }$ , was $0 . 0 1 \\mathrm { C } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ in this round robin.

R1-3.4.2 Classification of the accidental and wearout modes, that is, the A-B and W modes, is far from easy because the W mode gradually shifts toward the A-B mode as shown in Figures R1-3, R1-5 and R1-6. It is statistically supported that the Weibull plot is straight in the W mode region. The regression straight line has the correlation coefficient higher than 0.9 with the experimental data. When the A-B mode breakdown events are added to the breakdown data, a correlation coefficient of the data and its straight line approximation decreases.

    "content": "1.1  This method, a simplified version of ASTM D 445 and ASTM F 66 is intended for determining the kinematic viscosity of photoresists by measuring the time for a volume of liquid to flow under gravity through a calibrated glass capillary at a fixed temperature. Efflux time is measured in seconds and multiplied by the calibration constant of the viscometer to obtain kinematic viscosity in units of centistokes (cSt). Optionally, kinematic viscosity may be multiplied by the density of the photoresist to obtain dynamic viscosity in units of centipoise (cP). Refer to ASTM D 445 and $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } 6 6$ for additional information and definitions.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use."

Choose the proper tube size for the given viscosity so that the efflux time is greater than or equal to 200 seconds. 4.3 Charge the viscometer with photoresist in the manner dictated by the design of the viscometer and wipe clean. 4.4 Insert the viscometer into the clamp holder in the constant temperature bath. Vertical alignment of the viscometer is essential for proper flow measurement. 4.5 Allow 15 minutes for the sample temperature to equilibrate. 4.6 Use suction or pressure to adjust the level of the test sample to a position in the capillary arm about 5 mm ahead of the first timing mark. 4.7 With the sample flowing freely, measure the time for the meniscus to pass from the first timing mark to the second. Record the time in seconds. 4.8 Repeat the steps in Sections 4.6 and 4.7. (For reverse flow viscometers, use"
