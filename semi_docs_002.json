Wafers may be transported in cassettes or in carriers (such as cassettes in pods). Automation provides flexibility with regard to the range of interface coordinates it can accommodate. On the other hand, it is clear that humans will continue to load carriers on tools in many fabs. SEMI E15 is an attempt to satisfy all of these needs, including continued human compatibility. In fact, compatibility of automation and human ergonomics has been considered of primary importance in the rewrite of this standard.

It must also provide a means of determining the gas flow rate through the mass flow controller that responds to changes in gas flow significantly faster than the device under test. The recommended flow system for testing the speed of response of MFCs is shown in Figure 3a. 3.2 The flow system shall have str aight tubing or pipe connecting the MFC to the master reference standard. The inside diameter of the interconnecting tubing or pipe shall be of sufficient size to preclude any pressure drop that would affect the performance of the MFC. 3.3 The pneumatic time constant, T au, should be minimized.

The system concept involves mating a door on a cassette container to a door on an equipment enclosure and transferring the cassette into, and out of, the equipment without exposing the cassette and substrates to outside contamination.  \n2.2  The incorporation of this standard may require equipment designers to include the features of the interface into the tool design. Spacing between open cassette ports must be considered when incorporating this interface. Designers are directed to the specifications and recommendations made in SEMI E15 in this regard.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.
