Ensure that the front surface of the adjacent wafer is not contacted during the removal.  \nNOTE 1:  Any contact with the front surface of the adjacent wafer can transfer contamination and generally scratch the surface.\n\nSEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 8.2  Preliminary Sample Inspection:\n\n8.2.1  Inspect the first sample using high intensity light conditions as described in SEMI MF523 to identify any surface imperfections, scratches, or contamination hazes that may interfere with the etching process or confound the result.  If any of these interferences are detected, select a separate sample for analysis.  \nNOTE 2:  These interferences can generate artifacts that may be confused with the true defects.  \n8.2.2  Epitaxial Wafer, Nondestructive Defect Counting Inspect epitaxial wafers microscopically in accordance with SEMI MF1810 before defect etching to count most of the epitaxial stacking fault defects.  \nNOTE: The orientation of the wafer defines the location and direction of the line defects.\n\nSEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # Figure 1 Slip Defects as Seen with Macroscopic HighIntensity Light Inspection\n\nNOTE 3:  Epitaxial defects are more clearly delineated with etching, but that is a destructive process.\n\nSEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 8.3  Defect Etching (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 8.3  Defect Etching\n\nContent: 8.3.1 Epitaxial Wafers — Etch samples with epitaxial layers greater than $2 \\mathrm { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness (as measured by SEMI MF95) with removal of at least $0 . 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ to highlight the crystal defects for quantification. Etch samples with epitaxial layers less than $2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ with removal of no more than $50 \\%$ of the layer thickness. Other removal amounts are acceptable based upon producer-consumer agreement. (See Note 4.) 8.3.2 Polished Wafers — The sample must be etched with a removal of 5 to $1 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ to highlight the crystal defects for quantification. Other removal amounts are acceptable based upon producer/consumer agreement. 8.3.3 Refer to SEMI MF1809 for more etching information. NOTE 4: Crystal defects become more clearly visible for unaided eye inspection with increased removal, but resolution of the epitaxial induced defects is reduced with increasing etch times. 8.4 Sample Inspection — Evaluate the preferentially etched\n\nSEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 8.3  Defect Etching (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1726-1103 PRACTICE FOR ANALYSIS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PERFECTION OF SILICON WAFERS - # 8.3  Defect Etching\n\nContent: sample in two stages, macroscopic and microscopic. 8.4.1 First inspect the sample macroscopically under high intensity light conditions as described in SEMI MF523 to detect patterns of defects, such as the slip patterns shown schematically in Figure 1.

Last previous edition SEMI MF1727-02.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  Defects induced by thermal processing of silicon wafers may adversely influence device performance and yield.  \n1.2  These defects are influenced directly by contamination, ambient atmosphere, temperature, time at temperature, and rate of change of temperature to which the specimens are subjected.  Conditions vary significantly among device manufacturing technologies. The thermal cycling procedures of this practice are intended to simulate basic device processing technologies.  Oxidation cycles other than specified herein, or multiple oxidation cycles, may sometimes more accurately simulate device-processing procedures. The results obtained may differ significantly from those obtained with the specified oxidation cycles.  \n1.3  The geometry of some patterns revealed by this practice suggests that they are related to the crystal growth process while others seem related to surface preparation or thermal cycling conditions.  \n1.4  This practice is suitable for acceptance testing when used with referenced practices and methods.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This practice covers the detection of crystalline defects in the surface region of silicon wafers. The defects are induced or enhanced by oxidation cycles encountered in normal device processing. An atmospheric pressure oxidation cycle representative of bipolar, metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) and CMOS technologies is included. This practice reveals strain fields arising from the presence of precipitates, oxidation induced stacking faults, and shallow etch pits. Slip is also revealed that arises when internal or edge stresses are applied to the wafer. 2.2 Application of this practice is limited to specimens that have been chemical or chemical/mechanical polished to remove surface damage from at least one side of the specimen. This practice may also be applied to detection of defects in epitaxial layers. 2.3 The surface of the specimen opposite the surface to be investigated may be damaged deliberately or otherwise treated for gettering purposes or chemically etched to remove damage.

It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Material having residual work damage in the polished surface exhibits visible patterns when the procedures of this practice are used. Usually, edge damage, lapping damage, tool marks, or scratches are easily identified by the location and pattern observed. 3.2 Contamination not removed by preparatory cleaning procedures or deposited following cleaning, may become visible after oxidation and preferential etching. 3.3 Slip may be introduced by differential expansion at the points of wafer support in the furnace boat. Slip radiating from the points of support may be assumed to originate from this boat pinch and not be inherent in the unprocessed wafer. Slip may also be caused by large thermal gradients imposed across a wafer by fast insertion or removal from the furnace. 3.4 If the oxidation furnace or apparatus is contaminated, it can cause extraneous artifacts or defects. 3.5 Striations, helical features on the surface of a silicon wafer, are ascribed to periodic dopant incorporation differences\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: occurring at the rotating solidliquid interface during crystal growth. These features are visible to the unaided eye after preferential etching, seem continuous under $1 0 0 \\times$ magnification, and may be confused with ring patterns of oxidation stacking faults. 3.6 Otherwise identical wafers with different back surface conditions may yield different results by this practice. 3.7 Wafers, particularly $< 1 1 1 >$ orientation, may show lower shallow-pit defect density when the back surface of the wafer is gettered. Backside gettering should be noted in the sample classification when data are reported.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI C3.19 — Standard for Hydrogen $\\left( \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\right)$ $9 9 . 9 9 9 5 \\%$ Quality  \nSEMI C28 — Specifications and Guidelines for Hydrofluoric Acid  \nSEMI C54 — Specifications and Guidelines for Oxygen  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology  \nSEMI MF1809 — Guide for Selection and Use of Etching Solutions to Delineate Structural Defects in Silicon  \nSEMI MF1810 Test Method for Counting Preferentially Etched or Decorated Surface Defects in Silicon Wafers\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 4.2  ASTM Standard 1\n\nD 5127 — Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in the Electronics and Semiconductor Industry  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Defect-related terminology may be found in SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 6  Summary of Practice\n\n6.1  Wet oxidation is used to generate or highlight defects, or both, in silicon wafers.

Reagents for which SEMI specifications have not been developed shall conform to the specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society,2 where such specifications are available. Gases shall conform to the purity requirements of the cited SEMI specifications.  Other grades may be used provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of sufficiently high purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of the determination.  \n8.2  Purity of Water — Reference to water shall be understood to mean Type E-3 or better water as described in ASTM Guide D 5127.  \n8.3  Hydrofluoric Acid — Concentrated, in accordance with Grade 1 of SEMI C28.  \n8.4  Hydrogen Gas — In accordance with SEMI C3.19, for use in pyrogenic steam generator.  \n8.5  Oxygen Gas — In accordance with SEMI C54, for use both as furnace ambient and in pyrogenic steam generator.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 9  Sampling\n\n9.1  Select specimens to represent the lot to be tested as specified in producer/consumer agreements.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 10  Specimen Preparation\n\n10.1  Commonly this practice may be used for wafers as they are received; however, the parties using this practice may establish a uniform cleaning procedure before oxidation.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 11  Preparation of Apparatus\n\n11.1  The oxidation furnace tube (working chamber) and associated quartzware shall be maintained in a state suitable for producing oxides appropriate for the process for which the wafers are being tested.  \n11.2  Immediately before use, clean the pickup tool using standard industry practices.\n\nSEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 12  Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1727-0304 PRACTICE FOR DETECTION OF OXIDATION INDUCED DEFECTS IN POLISHED SILICON WAFERS - # 12  Procedure\n\nContent: 12.1 Handle wafers only with a clean, nonmetallic pickup tool or automated transfer unit to avoid scratching or contaminating the surface. 12.2 Oxidize the wafers by the thermal sequence listed in Table 1 or by a process acceptable to both producer and consumer. 12.2.1 Caution — Pyrogenic steam oxidation uses heated hydrogen and oxygen to grow a wet oxide layer. Improper or uncontrolled combination of these gases can result in fire or explosion. 12.2.2 Preheat the furnace to the push temperature. Table 1 Oxidation Procedure 12.2.3 Load the specimen wafers into the wafer boat, being careful to avoid binding, scratching, or contamination. 12.2.4 Insert the boat into the hot zone at the rate called for in the thermal sequence being employed.

Current edition approved for publication by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004.

However, since the values obtained cannot be entirely divorced from the process of fabricating the test structure, suitable correlations should be performed based on process needs and structure selection. This correlation should include sample size as well as device geometry. 1.2 Measurement of the electrical integrity of oxides grown on silicon wafers may also be used in-house as a means of monitoring the quality of furnaces and other processing steps as well as judging the impact of changing some processing steps. permit separation of so-called intrinsic and extrinsic oxide failures. 1.3 Selection of various edge and area intensive structures is crucial for isolating the nature of the defects. Techniques for using such structures to isolate the nature of detected defects is beyond the scope of this test method. NOTE 1: In\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 1  Purpose (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: this regard this test method differs from that given in SEMI M51, which is focused on application of gate oxide integrity measurements, as described in this test method, to determine the density of crystal originated pits in the wafer under test. SEMI M51 also provides a standardized procedure for fabricating the MOS capacitors. 1.4 The actual results are somewhat dependent on the choice of gate electrode. Polysilicon gates have the advantage of being identical to finished product in many instances. Even for polysilicon gates, exact results depend upon values chosen for polysilicon thickness, doping, and sheet resistance. 2.2 The background of this test method is provided in Related Information 1. 2.3 This test method covers the procedure for gaging the electrical strength of silicon dioxide thin films with thicknesses ranging from approximately $3 \\mathrm { n m }$ to $5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . In the analysis of films of $4 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ or less, the impact of direct tunneling on the current-voltage\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 1  Purpose (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 1  Purpose\n\nContent: characteristics, and hence the specified failure criteria defined in Section 5.4, must be taken into account. Since oxide integrity strongly depends on wafer defects, contamination, cleanliness, as well as processing, the users of this test method are expected to include wafer manufacturers and device manufacturers.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 The techniques outlined in this standard are for the purpose of standardizing the procedure of measurement, analysis, and reporting of oxide integrity data between interested parties. 2.4 This test method is not structure specific, but notes regarding options for different structures may be found in the appendix. The three most likely structures are simple planar metal-oxide semiconductor (MOScapacitors) (fabricated or mercury probe), various isolation structures (for example, local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS)), and field effect transistors. This test method assumes that a low resistance ohmic contact is made to the backside of each wafer in each case. For a more detailed discussion of the design and evaluation of test structures for this test method, the reader is referred to the EIA/JEDEC Standard 35-1. 2.1.1 This test method makes no representation regarding actual device failure rates or acceptance/rejection criteria. 2.1.2 While some suggestions for data analysis are included in later sections of this\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: test method, interpretation of results is beyond the scope of this standard. Any such interpretations should be agreed upon between interested parties prior to testing. For example, a variety of failure criteria are included to 2.5 Failure criteria specified in this test method include both the fixed current limit (soft) and destructive (hard) types. In the past, use of a fixed current limit of $1 \\mu \\mathrm { A }$ or more virtually ensured measurement of hard failure, as the thicker, more heavily contaminated oxides of those days typically failed catastrophically as soon as measurable currents were passed. The cleaner processing of thinner oxides now means that oxides will sustain relatively large currents with little or no evidence of failure. While use of fixed current limit testing may still be of value for assessing uniformity issues, it is widely felt that failure to continue oxide breakdown testing to the point of catastrophic oxide failure may mask the presence of defect tails, which are of critical\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: importance in assessing long-term oxide reliability. For this reason, this test method makes provision for use of fixed limit failure criteria if desired and agreed upon by the parties to the testing, but specifies that testing be continued until hard failure is sensed. 2.6 This test method specifically does not include measurement of a charge-to-breakdown $( Q _ { \\mathrm { b d } } )$ parameter. Industry experience with this parameter measured in a ramp-to-failure test such as this indicates that $Q _ { \\mathrm { b d } }$ values so obtained may be unreliable indicators of oxide quality. This is because a large fraction of the value determined is collected in the last steps of the test, and the result is subject to large deviations. $Q _ { \\mathrm { b d } }$ should be measured in a constant current or bounded current ramp test. This test method is applicable to both $n$ -type and $p$ -type wafers, polished or having an epitaxial layer. In wafers with epitaxial layers, the conductivity type of the layer should be\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: the same as that of the bulk wafer. While not excluding depletion polarity, it is preferred that measurement polarity should be in accumulation to void the complication of a voltage drop across the depletion layer. 2.7 While this test method is primarily intended for use in characterizing the $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ -silicon systems as stated above, it may be applied in general terms to the measurement of other metal-insulator-semiconductor structures if appropriate consideration of the characteristics of the other materials is made. 2.8 Measurement conditions specified in this test method are conservative, intended for thorough analysis of high quality oxide-silicon systems, and to provide a regime in which new users may safely begin testing without encountering undue experimental artifacts. It is recognized that some experienced users may be working in applications where less precise data is required and a more rapid test is desirable. An example of this situation is the evaluation of silicon wafer quality,\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: where a staircase voltage step providing 0.5 MV/cm oxide field strength resolution and a voltage step duration of 0.2 s has been used. Such test conditions may be specified when agreed upon as adequate by all participants to the testing. Because the dependence of measured parameters upon test conditions may increase as these conditions depart from those specified in this test method, it is important that all parties to these tests use the same set of test conditions, so that their results are comparable. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: 3.1 Since this is a dc measurement, care must be taken to make sure that the wafer has a low resistance ohmic return contact. This is preferably done with a metallized contact to the back side of the wafer under test. In cases where testing must be done on capacitors in diffused wells of conductivity type opposite to the substrate, top side contacts carefully designed to provide uniform, low resistance to all parts of the test capacitor should be used. A discussion of these design criteria is given in Standard 35-1. 3.2 It is strongly suggested that testing be done with a voltage polarity to accumulate the silicon surface underlying the oxide; positive voltages for $n$ -type substrates and negative voltages for $p$ -type substrates. If this is not done, a topside contact to a diffused region of opposite conductivity type surrounding the capacitor (a gated diode or transistor) should be used to minimize the problem of uncontrolled voltage drops across the inversion layer during testing. This is an absolute\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: requirement for testing $p$ -type substrate capacitors under positive bias, where sufficient electrons to support conduction and breakdown are not available without the $n$ -type region. 3.3 Evaluation and control of electrical noise in the current-voltage data taken as part of this test method is crucial to the proper identification of the failure criteria, particularly the ln $J { - } V$ slope change criterion defined in Section 9.9.4. Approaches for minimizing electrical noise in the measurements are suggested in Section 7 on Apparatus, and an approach for noise evaluation is given in Section 10.3. 3.4 Control of the voltage step time may be difficult when using automated electrometers in a voltage staircase regime. While the required 100-ms step time may be set using a delay in the measurement loop, an additional, uncontrolled delay may be incurred due to autoranging of the electrometer. The effect is most pronounced for very low currents, where the measured value is several orders of magnitude below the\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: minimum range set by the electrometer software. An example of this effect is discussed in Section 10.3. 3.5 The method of probing the device may affect the results. Examples of possible variables are probe pressure and use of a contact pad versus direct contact to the gate. 3.6 Use of gate electrode material other than polysilicon may mask differences in materials and make the material look worse than it might otherwise appear if polysilicon gates are used. This is because the process of forming a gate electrode on an oxide sample may affect the integrity of that oxide either for better or for worse. Sputtering or radiation damage accompanying metal gate deposition may degrade oxide integrity, while the high temperature annealing and gettering associated with polysilicon deposition and doping may improve oxide quality. On the other hand, stress arising from crystal formation in the polysilicon, or impurity diffusion along polysilicon grain boundaries may degrade oxide integrity. Changes of gate-substrate\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: work function difference may also affect the breakdown and wearout mechanisms in the oxide. Therefore, potential effects of gate electrode material choice on test results must not be neglected. 3.7 The actual values obtained depend somewhat on the processing involved in fabricating the test structure. Care must be taken to ensure a consistent processing. 3.8 Wafer temperature during testing should be clearly defined. While oxide breakdown voltages are not strongly temperature-dependent, the oxide wearout mechanism is temperature-sensitive, and large temperature variations might have an impact on results. 3.9 Warning — Since the voltage and currents involved are potentially dangerous, appropriate means of preventing the operator from coming into contact with the probe tip or other charged surfaces should be in place before testing. 3.10 When testing very thin oxides, those $1 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ or less in thickness, special care must be taken to account for effects arising from the very high specific\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 3  Limitations\n\nContent: capacitance of these films. These may include voltage drops across the polysilicon gate electrode and the silicon substrate, and high conduction due to direct tunneling. 3.11 When using a mercury probe for measurements of this type, care must be taken in the preparation and control of the oxide surface. Adsorbed organic contaminant films may affect the electric field distribution in the oxide. Such films may sometimes be removed with hot SC-1 cleaning solution; a mixture of $\\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } O H \\mathrm { - } H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } \\mathrm { - } H _ { 2 } O }$ . Use of a dry nitrogen purge of the probing ambient is also recommended to minimize surface contamination effects.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 4.2  EIA/JEDEC Standards 1\n\nStandard 35 — Procedure for the Wafer-Level Testing of Thin Dielectrics  \nStandard 35-1 — General Guidelines for Designing Test Structures for the Wafer-Level Testing of Thin Dielectrics  \nStandard 35-2 — Test Criteria for the Wafer-Level Testing of Thin Dielectrics  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 5.1  Definitions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 5.1  Definitions\n\nContent: 5.1.1 hard failure — destructive failure of an MOS capacitor associated with rupture of the oxide film. 5.1.1.1 Discussion — This is sensed by an abrupt, irreversible change in the current-voltage characteristics of the capacitor.

If the measured current exceeds a value equivalent to $1 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\mathrm { A / c m } ^ { 2 }$ (or a current value of $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n A } }$ if the device area is at or below $1 0 ^ { - 3 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \\cdot$ ), record this device as a Category 0 failure and proceed to Section 9.11. 9.5 From the starting bias condition (zero if no pretest was done, or the voltage of use if a pretest was used) record voltage and current. 9.6 Begin increasing the voltage bias at a rate equivalent to an electric field increment of $1 . 0 ~ \\pm ~ 0 . 1$ $\\mathrm { \\bf \\dot { M } V – c m ^ { - 1 } – s \\ ^ { - 1 } }$ . Note that other ramp rates may be used if it can be shown that it does not affect the results, or if it is agreed upon by all parties to the test. 9.7 Record current-voltage data at an interval no more than 0.1 s between readings, or at least once near the end of each voltage step. 9.8 After each current reading, test to\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 9  Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 9  Procedure\n\nContent: see if any of the soft failure criteria have been met. If so, store the appropriate value. 9.9 After each current reading, check to see if one of the hard failure criteria has been reached. 9.9.1 Check to see if the current has increased to a value greater than or equal to 0.98 times the compliance limit of the voltage ramp source. If so, record the previous voltage level as the hard failure voltage, and set the failure category to 1. Divide the current level at the previous measurement point by the capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure current density for this unit. 9.9.2 Check to see if the current has increased by a factor of 1000 or more from the previous reading. If so, record the previous voltage level as the hard failure voltage, and set the failure category to 2. Divide the current value measured at the previous point by the capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure current density. 9.9.3 Check to see if the current has increased by a factor of 10 or more in two\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 9  Procedure (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 9  Procedure\n\nContent: consecutive voltage steps. If so, record the previous voltage level as the hard failure voltage, and set the failure category to 3. Divide the current value measured at the previous point by the capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure current density. 9.9.4 If the current is above the noise threshold level, check for an abrupt increase in the current by a factor of ten. If this has occurred, record the previous voltage level as the hard failure voltage, and set the failure category to 4. Divide the current value measured at the previous point by the capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure current density. 9.9.5 If the current is above the noise threshold level, check for an abrupt change in the logarithmic slope of the current density-voltage characteristic of the unit. To minimize the chance of detecting a false reading, use the average of the previous five (V,I) data pairs to compute the established slope, and the current and previous $( V , I )$ data pairs to compute the\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 9  Procedure (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 9  Procedure\n\nContent: new slope. A change by a factor of three shall constitute a failure. If this has occurred, record the previous voltage level as the hard failure voltage, and set the failure category to 5. Divide the current value measured at the previous point by the capacitor area, and record this value as the hard failure current density. 9.10 After hard failure has been detected by one of the criteria in Section 9.9 or the upper test voltage limit has been reached, perform a post-test using the same criteria defined for the pretest in Section 9.4.1. This is to be done whether a pretest was elected in Section 9.4 or not. If the unit fails the post-test conditions, modify the failure category in some way to reflect this observation. For example, one may change the sign of the failure category number, or add an asterisk. 9.11 Proceed to the next device to be tested, and repeat Sections $9 . 3 \\mathrm { - } 9 . 1 0 \\$ until all devices are tested.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: 10.1 Current and Current Density — To calculate current $( I )$ from a current density $( J )$ , multiply the current density by the area of gate contact $( A )$ as follows: than $2 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ thick, as the correction amounted to only a few percent of the breakdown voltage values. For thinner oxides, these additional voltage components must be taken into account. 10.2.1 The voltage Vapp a pplied across an MOS capacitor with a given gate-substrate work function difference $\\Phi _ { m s }$ and oxide fixed charge $Q _ { f }$ may be expressed as follows: $$ V _ { a p p } = \\left( V _ { o x } - \\left( \\frac { Q _ { f } } { C _ { o x } } + \\Phi _ { m s } \\right) \\right) + V _ { s u b } + V _ { g a t e } $$ where: $$ I = J \\times A $$ NOTE 3: Example: Given a current density $( J )$ of $1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { A } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ and a gate area $( A )$ of $0 . 0 8 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ , the current would be $8 0 \\mathrm { n A }$ . 10.1.1 Similarly, compute current density ( $J$ in $\\mathrm { A\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } .$ ) from measured current $\\boldsymbol { { \\mathit { I } } }$ in A) and area $( A { \\mathrm { ~ i n ~ } } \\operatorname { c m } ^ { 2 } )$ using $$ J = { \\frac { I } { A } } $$ 10.2 Oxide Voltage and Electric Field Strength as a Function of Applied Voltage — Since ramp voltage test increments and ramp rates as well as some breakdown voltage data analyses are specified in terms of oxide electric field strength, it is important to consider the conversion of applied voltages to oxide voltage and electric field values for these two cases. Historically, oxide electric field strength has been approximated simply by dividing the applied voltage by the thickness of the oxide. This approximation is in error because it neglects the offset in the zero values of applied and oxide voltage brought about by the work function difference between gate electrode and silicon substrate, and the voltages dropped across the substrate (and the gate electrode, if it is non-metallic) when the capacitor\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: is strongly biased during breakdown testing. These voltage drops are made up of two components; one associated with band bending at the interfaces with the oxide that establishes the high fields required for testing, and another involving additional voltage drops due to series resistances that become significant at very high currents. These corrections, which together normally range up to 1 to $2 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ in magnitude, might reasonably be neglected for samples with oxides greater 10.2.2 At zero volts applied, the offset due to the work function difference and oxide charge appears predominantly across the oxide. For setting a voltage ramp rate, the incremental change in $V _ { \\mathrm { o x } }$ with changing $V _ { a p p }$ is not affected by this offset, but may be decreased by voltage increases across the silicon substrate or the gate electrode due to band bending and series resistance drops. For a sample in which the applied bias voltage polarity accumulates the substrate, and the gate\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: electrode is metallic or of the opposite conductivity type from the substrate (for example, $p$ -type silicon substrate and $^ { n + }$ polysilicon gate), these effects are appreciable only for very small and very large applied voltages. At low bias, silicon bands bend until the surface becomes degenerate, after which the rate of band bending becomes very low. At high biases, significant resistive voltage drops may develop if the test structure design is not optimized. Over the largest portion of the test in which neither of these effects are large, ramp rates may be computed assuming that voltage increments applied to the device under test appear completely across the oxide, and $\\Delta E _ { \\mathrm { o x } } .$ , the electric field increment across the oxide, is given as follows: $$ \\Delta E _ { o x } = \\frac { \\Delta V _ { a p p } } { W _ { o x } } $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l } { W _ { o x } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ oxide thickness, cm. 10.2.3 For computations of oxide field strength associated\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: with the various hard and soft failure criteria, all corrections indicated in Equation 3 must be taken into account. 10.3 Determination of Noise Threshold Current Level and ln J-V Slope Ratio Specification — Useable values of noise threshold current level and ln $J _ { \\cdot } V$ slope ratio depend upon properties of the test system as well as the samples to be evaluated, and a preliminary test may be required in order to specify them properly. To do this, it is necessary to store all the current-voltage data pairs as well as the incremental voltage step time readings in data arrays. This is not required for performance of the bulk of the testing, but is sometimes useful for more thorough analysis of the test results. When such data is stored, it is possible to construct a figure like that shown in Figure 2, which is a semi-logarithmic plot of sample current, step time, and slope ratio versus applied voltage. Data given here was taken on a $3 \\mathrm { - n m }$ oxide on a $p$ -type silicon substrate, so\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: the current and voltage values are magnitudes of negative readings. Both direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling components are seen in the I-V data. 10.3.1 To determine the noise threshold current level, examine the ln $J { - } V$ slope ratio, shown as open triangles in Figure 2. It is seen to be quite noisy for this test system and sample up to a current level just below 1 nA. This value, $1 \\ \\mathrm { n A }$ , is thus a good choice for noise threshold current level for this test. Further analysis of the slope ratio data shows that its maximum value in the range from $1 \\ \\mathrm { n A }$ up to catastrophic failure is 1.21, so the standard specified ratio value of three (3) is adequate to avoid significant noise interference. 10.3.2 The step time-voltage dependence plotted as light squares in Figure 2 illustrates shortcomings in the step time control for this configuration of the measurement system. A voltage step time of $0 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ is specified for this test method in Sections 5.3 and 9.7.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: Because of the high, time-dependent currents measured below $0 . 5 \\mathrm { \\ : V }$ , there is a regime below $_ { 1 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ where this is observed, but most readings from there up to a current value of $0 . 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { A }$ fall in the range 0.2 to $0 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ . Also, for higher current values, there are singular points at electrometer range changes where 0.2-s delays are encountered. It has been shown (Klema4) that deviations of this amount do not have large effects on breakdown voltage distributions, but these extended delays affect total measurement time, and it would be worthwhile to eliminate them if possible. Approaches depend upon measurement hardware being used, but trading off low current resolution for electrometer autoranging time and look-ahead range changing code are possibilities. 10.4 ln J-V Slope Hard Failure Criterion — Hard breakdown failure of oxides is increasingly difficult to detect as oxide thickness decreases below $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ n m }$ .\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: Fowler-Nordheim emission, the dominant current transport mechanism for $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ films in this thickness range, predicts that at a given field strength, the logarithmic slope of the $J _ { \\neg } V$ characteristic increases for decreasing film thickness, but decreases with increasing field strength for a given oxide thickness. Thus, a change in ln $J _ { \\neg } V$ slope may be a more sensitive detector of failure for these very thin films, where high failure current density, low oxide impedance at failure, and high voltage drops in series resistances might lead to very small current changes when the oxide ruptures. 10.4.1 Experience with this failure criterion for oxide thicknesses ranging down to $3 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ indicates that a change by a factor of 3 provides good detection of failure while remaining above the noise level in the data. Users may verify this condition for their particular sample and test conditions, and change the failure factor accordingly. Any such change must be\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: agreed upon by the parties to the test, and clearly identified in the report of the data. 10.4.2 In order to minimize noise in the calculated values and optimize the sensitivity of the failure detection, it has been found advisable to use a set of five data points to calculate the established and new values of the ln $J _ { \\neg } V$ slope. This illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the last few data points in the ramp voltage test of a ${ 5 0 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { n m }$ oxide. Data points are spaced at $0 . 1 \\mathrm { M V / c m }$ increments, as dictated by this test method. $1 0 . 4 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { ~ I n }$ particular, the last five data points are labeled $( V ( n ) , I ( n ) )$ through $( V ( n \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 5 )$ , $I ( n \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 5 )$ , respectively. The established logarithmic slope is as follows: while the new slope is computed from the last two points, $$ \\mathrm { a b s } \\left( { \\frac { \\left( \\ln \\left( \\mathrm { a b s } \\left( { \\frac { I ( n ) } { I ( n - 1 ) } } \\right) \\right)\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # 10  Calculations\n\nContent: \\right) } { \\left( V ( n ) - V ( n - 1 ) \\right) } } \\right) $$ $$ \\mathrm { a b s } \\left( \\frac { \\left( \\ln \\left( \\mathrm { a b s } \\left( \\frac { I \\left( n - 1 \\right) } { I \\left( n - 5 \\right) } \\right) \\right) \\right) } { \\left( V \\left( n - 1 \\right) - V \\left( n - 5 \\right) \\right) } \\right) $$ 10.4.4 Testing for the failure criterion is done by taking the ratio of Equation 6 to Equation 5.

Given the fraction of devices reaching this criterion, the defect density calculation may be based on a Poisson relationship (see Standard 35) using the following equation: $$ Y = \\exp ( - A D ) $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l } { Y } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ yield of good units in terms of the defined failure criterion, NOTE 4: Example: Given a total of 100 devices tested with 87 devices passing the minimum criterion for success and a gate area of $\\mathbf { \\bar { 0 . 0 8 } } \\mathbf { c m } ^ { 2 }$ , the defect density would be as follows: $$ D = { \\frac { \\ln ( 8 7 / 1 0 0 ) } { 0 . 0 8 } } = 1 . 7 \\mathrm { d e f e c t s / c m } ^ { 2 } $$ 10.5.1 An undefined condition results if the number of successes is zero. It may be necessary to change the area of the test capacitor chosen for testing in order to resolve meaningful defect densities.

It was developed during the original development of the document.  This related information was approved for publication by full letter ballot on December 4, 2003.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-1  Overview\n\nR1-1.1  This is a voltage ramp test.  It is most useful in determining changes in a given process.  It is intended to be applied to arrays of similar capacitors on a silicon wafer or group of wafers representing a process condition specified by the user.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-2  Voltage Ramp\n\nR1-2.1  While this test can, and might best be done using a true linear voltage ramp, constraints of the automated test equipment most often used in its performance lead to widespread use of a staircase of voltage steps to simulate the ramp.  The ramp rate is specified in terms of the rate of increase of the oxide electric field.  For oxides thicker than about $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ , the oxide electric field has been commonly estimated by dividing the applied voltage by the oxide thickness, but for thinner films, significant errors may be introduced by ignoring the effects of non-zero flat band voltage of the MOS capacitor and voltages developed across the silicon substrate (and the gate electrode as well, if it is polysilicon) due to band bending and series resistance. One approach to estimation of the relationship between sample parameters and oxide field strength is found in Section 10.2.  \nrange $1 \\ \\mathrm { n A }$ to $0 . 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { A }$ for most test systems.  Hard failure criteria below the noise threshold level are defined as follows:\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4.2.1  Current greater than or equal to 0.98 times the compliance limit of the current score — This condition signals total collapse of the capacitor.\n\nR1-4.2.2  Current change by a factor of 1000 in a single voltage step — Units with gross defects failing at low voltages where currents are below the noise threshold commonly fail with very large increases in current.  \nR1-4.2.3  Consecutive current increases by a factor of 10 in each of two voltage steps — Test capacitors that are initially highly conductive, as from a pinhole, often do not display destructive breakdown, but rather show steeply rising diodic leakage currents.  This failure criterion is designed to identify these defective units at low voltage.  Above the noise threshold current level, the two criteria above remain in force, and two others are added, as follows:  \nR1-4.2.4  Current change by a factor of 10 in a single step — In the Fowler-Nordheim regime, current changes are much less than this value for the small increment in oxide field associated with a single voltage step.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-3  Current Sampling\n\nR1-3.1  In order to provide adequate breakdown field strength resolution, it is specified that current readings be taken after a maximum electric field change of 0.1 $\\mathbf { M V } / { \\mathrm { c m } }$ .  Taken together with the specified voltage ramp rate, this leads to a maximum time between current readings of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ .  In the case in which the test is done using a voltage staircase, this implies use of a 100-ms voltage step duration, with one current reading taken at each step.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4  Failure Criteria (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4  Failure Criteria\n\nContent: R1-4.1 Both “hard” and “soft” failure criteria are provided for in this test methods. R1-4.2 Techniques for detection of hard oxide failure for thin dielectrics may require high resolution, low noise current-voltage data. For this reason, hard failure criteria are defined in two measurement regimes, one below and one above a threshold current level where noise is reduced. This current level is commonly in the R1-4.2.5 Change in the logarithmic slope of the J-V curve by a factor of 3 — This criterion becomes of increasingly great value for oxide films thinner than 10 nm, where destructive breakdown is often accompanied by very small changes in current, because of the very low resistance of these oxides at very high fields (see Standard 35-2). R1-4.3 Another parameter associated with hard failure is the hard failure current density, defined as the value of the current at the last measurement point prior to detection of hard failure, divided by the area of the capacitor. R1-4.4 Soft failures are\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4  Failure Criteria (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4  Failure Criteria\n\nContent: associated with the passage of a predetermined current through the capacitor under test. This type of criterion has been traditionally used, since in the past, passage of any measurable current through an oxide was normally associated with hard failure. More recently, where oxides have commonly been capable of sustaining Fowler-Nordheim tunneling conduction, use of such a criterion yields results indicative of the uniformity of the samples being tested. As such, soft failure criteria may be agreed upon between users of this test method in order to meet individual needs of the testing. Following are examples of commonly used criteria: R1-4.4.1 $V _ { c r i t }$ — The voltage associated with the noise threshold current level. R1-4.4.2 Vsoft fail $\\mathbf { \\Psi } = \\mathbf { \\Psi } V$ at $J = 1 0 0 \\ m A / c m ^ { 2 } \\ - \\ \\mathrm { F o r }$ many oxides, this current level is close to hard failure, but avoids the dispersion associated with high resistance voltage drops at high breakdown currents.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4  Failure Criteria (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # R1-4  Failure Criteria\n\nContent: R1-4.4.3 Vsoft fail $\\mathbf { \\Psi } = V \\mathbf { \\Psi }$ at $I = I . 5 \\ \\mu A$ — This criterion is widely used in Japan.3 Other values of current or current density may be used as soft failure criteria by agreement of the parties to the test.\n\nSEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # RELATED INFORMATION 2 SAMPLES AND TEST STRUCTURES (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1771-0304 TEST METHOD FOR EVALUATING GATE OXIDE INTEGRITY BY VOLTAGE RAMP TECHNIQUE - # RELATED INFORMATION 2 SAMPLES AND TEST STRUCTURES\n\nContent: NOTICE: This related information is not an official part of SEMI MF1771.

These defects take the form of dislocations, slip, stacking faults, shallow pits, or precipitates.  \n1.2  The exposure of the various defects found on or in a silicon wafer is often the first critical step in evaluating wafer quality or initiating failure analysis of an errant device structure.  Etching often accomplishes this task.

Research the choice of etchants in advance to ensure the method and solution are compatible with the sample and objectives. Commonly encountered problems are: 3.1.1 Inadvertent etching through the denuded zone of an oxidized sample delineates irrelevant bulk defects instead of the surface oxidation induced stacking faults (OISF) expected. 3.1.2 Accelerated etching and etching artifacts can result from excessive solution heating during the etching process. 3.1.3 Insufficient agitation, bubble formation or particles in the etching solution can generate artifacts on the silicon surface that mimic actual defects. Insufficient agitation can alter the etching rate, increasing or decreasing it depending upon the formulation. 3.1.4 Any solution in which the oxidation rate is greater than the oxide dissolution rate may form oxide layers that slow or even quench the etching process.

Before evaluation, remove any surface oxides. 3.1.5 The wafer surface becomes rougher with longer etch time. This rougher surface does not prevent evaluation under the microscope, but it greatly reduces the effectiveness of visual inspection under bright light. 3.1.6 Etching solutions can generate false pits that are not associated with defects. 3.1.7 The samples must be free of work damage, contamination, and other complicating residues. Clean, specular surfaces are suitable for metallographic examination and provide the best results. Surfaces examined should be flat with parallel faces, to simplify microscope inspection.\n\nSEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI C18 — Specification for Acetic Acid  \nSEMI C28 — Specifications and Guidelines for Hydrofluoric Acid  \nSEMI C35 — Specifications and Guidelines for Nitric Acid  \nSEMI MF523 Practice for Unaided Visual Inspection of Polished Silicon Wafer Surfaces  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology  \nSEMI MF1725 Practice for Analysis of Crystallographic Perfection of Silicon Ingots  \nSEMI MF1726 Practice for Analysis of Crystallographic Perfection of Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF1727 — Practice for Detection of Oxidation Induced Defects in Polished Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF1810 Test Method for Counting Preferentially Etched or Decorated Surface Defects in Silicon Wafers  \n4.2  ASTM Standard 1  \nD 5127 — Guide for Ultra Pure Water Used in the Electronics and Semiconductor Industry  \n4.3  Japan Industrial Standard2  \nJIS $\\mathrm { ~ H ~ } 0 6 0 9$ — Test Methods Of Crystalline Defects In Silicon By Preferential Etch Techniques  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Defect-related terminology may be found in SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 6  Apparatus (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 6  Apparatus\n\nContent: $6 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { N o }$ standard apparatus or facility satisfies the universal needs for the various applications of these etching solutions.

A simple system for manual use is as follows: 8.3.1.1 Place the specimen in the bottom of a HF-proof beaker with the surface to be inspected facing upward. 8.3.1.2 Pour in sufficient etchant to cover the specimen with about $2 \\mathrm { c m }$ of solution. 8.3.1.3 Maintain $^ { 1 \\mathrm { ~ L ~ } }$ of solution for each $1 { , } 0 0 0 \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ of sample surface area to control temperature effects. 8.3.1.4 Etch the specimen according to the removal and agitation restriction provided in the selection tables. The time of the etching process may be derived by use of the suggested etching depth for specific defects. NOTE 4: Suggested removals may be found in SEMI MF1725 and SEMI MF1726. 8.3.1.5 If the etching solution must be contained at the point of use, decant the solution into a container\n\nSEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 8.3  Defect Etching (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 8.3  Defect Etching\n\nContent: for (hazardous) waste and rinse the specimen thoroughly with running water. If the solution is chromium-free and is not contained for disposal, the solution may be quenched with water and thoroughly rinsed in the same beaker. 8.3.1.6 Blow the specimen dry with filtered, organic free nitrogen. 8.3.1.7 Store the specimen in a clean container until inspected.\n\nSEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 9  Related Documents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1809-0704 GUIDE FOR SELECTION AND USE OF ETCHING SOLUTIONS TO DELINEATE STRUCTURAL DEFECTS IN SILICON - # 9  Related Documents\n\nContent: 9.1 Additional information may be found in the following references that report details of various etching solutions: Sirtl, E., and Adler, A. “Chromic Acid-Hydrofluoric Acid as Specific Reagents for the Development of Etching Pits in Silicon,” Z.

Current edition approved for publication by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004.  Originally published by ASTM International as ASTM F 1810-97.  Last previous edition SEMI MF1810-97 (Reapproved 2002).\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  Defects on or in silicon wafers may adversely affect device performance and yield.  \n1.2  Crystal defect analysis is a useful technique in troubleshooting device process problems. The type, location, and density of defects counted by this test method may be related to the crystal growth process, surface preparation, contamination, or thermal history of the wafer.  \n1.3  This test method is suitable for acceptance testing when used with referenced standards.\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method describes the technique to count the density of surface defects in silicon wafers by microscopic analysis. NOTE 1: Practical use of a defect counting method requires an assumption be made that defects are randomly distributed on the surface. If this assumption is not met, the accuracy and precision of this test method will be diminished. 2.2 Application of this test method is limited to specimens that have discrete, identifiable artifacts on the surface of the silicon sample. Typical samples have been preferentially etched according to SEMI MF1809 or epitaxially deposited, forming defects in a silicon layer structure. 2.3 Wafer thickness and diameter for this test method is limited only by the range of microscope stage motions available. 2.4 This test method is applicable to silicon wafers with defect density between 0.01 and 10,000 defects per cm2. NOTE 2: The commercially significant defect density range is between 0.01 to 10 defects per $\\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ , but this\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: test method extends to higher defect levels due to the improved statistical sampling obtained with higher counts. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  Improper identification of defects is possible during the counting process.  \n3.1.1  Contamination not removed by cleaning procedures or deposited following cleaning, may become visible after preferential etching.  \n3.1.2  Insufficient agitation during the preferential etching process may cause artifacts that may be mistaken as crystallographic defects.  \n3.2  The accuracy of the defect density calculation is directly affected by calibration of the area of the microscope field of view.  \n3.3  The defect density determined by this test method requires an assumption be made that defects are randomly distributed on the surface.  Nonuniform patterns of defects alter the defect density measurement by their size and location.  \n3.4  Multiple scan patterns intersect at the center of the wafer.  If a defect is found at this single, common point, it is counted more than once and thus alters the accuracy of the count.\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 4.1  SEMI Standards\n\nSEMI M1 — Specifications for Polished Monocrystalline Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF1241 — Terminology of Silicon Technology  \nSEMI MF1725 — Practice for Analysis of Crystallographic Perfection of Silicon Ingots  \nSEMI MF1726 — Practice for Analysis of Crystallographic Perfection of Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF1727 — Practice for Detection of Oxidation Induced Defects in Polished Silicon Wafers  \nSEMI MF1809 — Guide for Selection and Use of Etching Solutions to Delineate Structural Defects in Silicon  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Definitions of terms related to silicon technology are found in SEMI M1 and SEMI MF1241.\n\nSEMI MF1810-0304TEST METHOD FOR COUNTING PREFERENTIALLY ETCHED ORDECORATED SURFACE DEFECTS IN SILICON WAFERS - # 6  Summary of Test Method\n\n6.1  Samples for this test are selected and prepared in accordance with SEMI MF1725, SEMI MF1726 or SEMI MF1727.  As indicated in these practices, the defect to be analyzed is exposed using one of the specific etching solutions listed in SEMI MF1809.  \n6.2  The wafer is aligned on a microscope stage.  \n$6 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { ~ I t }$ is then inspected according to predefined inspection pattern.  \n6.3.1  The basic inspection pattern is a single scan along a wafer diameter.  The starting and ending points of the scan pattern are $5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the edges of the wafer.

Seven (7) wafers with randomly distributed oxidation induced stacking faults (OISFs) were analyzed by sixteen (16) laboratories over eleven (11) diameter scans. Repeatability and reproducibility of this test method were calculated using two sets of four scan measurements from each laboratory and wafer. The wafer samples were prepared according to SEMI MF1727 and etched with Wright Etch in accordance with SEMI MF1809. 11.1.1 Repeatability — The method repeatability is equal to 2.8 times the within-laboratory standard deviation or 5.22 defects/cm2. Repeatability contributes $23 . 8 1 \\%$ of the total variation.

A study of two repetitions of this test method was extracted from the existing, multiple scan data measured at each laboratory. 11.1.3 The wafers exhibited single diameter scans that ranged from 0 to 13 defects $\\bar { / } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ while the grand average of all measurements for each wafer yielded densities of 0.21 to 3.60 defects $/ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ . The range in measurement density is related to differences between laboratories and local variation of the defect density on the wafer itself. 11.1.4 Ten separate diameters were measured on each of 7 wafers by 16 laboratories. The total number of scans for each sample was 160. Table 1 shows the sample dependence of the results with the standard deviation versus mean OISF count for ten independent scans.

Use of this guide can eliminate these differences and result in the use of consistent units for the PSD and related parameters. It also provides a uniform reporting procedure for digital roughness data that can facilitate communication between different workers and different laboratories.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This guide defines the methodology for calculating a set of commonly used statistical parameters and functions of surface roughness from a set of measured surface profile data. Its purposes are to provide fundamental procedures and notation for processing and presenting data, to alert the reader to related issues that may arise in user-specific applications, and to provide literature references where further details can be found. 2.2 This guide is limited to the analysis of onedimensional or profile data taken at uniform intervals along straight lines across the surface under test, although reference is made to the more general case of two-dimensional measurements made over a rectangular array of data points. 2.3 The data analysis procedures described in this guide are generic and are not limited to specific surfaces, surface-generation techniques, degrees of roughness, or measuring techniques. Examples of measuring techniques that can be used to generate profile data for\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: analysis are mechanical profiling instruments using a rigid contacting probe, optical profiling instruments that sample over a line or an array over an area of the surface, optical interferometry, and scanning-microscopy techniques such as atomic-force microscopy. The distinctions between different measuring techniques enter this guide through various parameters and functions that are defined in Sections 4 and 5, such as their sampling intervals, bandwidths, and measurement transfer functions. 2.4 The primary interest here is the characterization of random or periodic aspects of surface finish rather than isolated surface defects such as pits, protrusions, scratches or ridges. Although the methods of data analysis described here can be equally well applied to profile data of isolated surface features, the parameters and functions that are derived using the procedures described in this guide may have a different physical significance than those derived from random or periodic\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: surfaces. 2.5 The statistical parameters and functions that are discussed in this guide are, in fact, mathematical abstractions that are generally defined in terms of an infinitely-long linear profile across the surface, or the “ensemble” average of an infinite number of finitelength profiles. In contrast, real profile data are available in the form of one or more sets of digitized height data measured at a finite number of discrete positions on the surface under test. This guide gives both the abstract definitions of the statistical quantities of interest, and numerical procedures for determining values of these abstract quantities from sets of measured data. In the notation of this guide these numerical procedures are called “estimators” and the results that they produce are called “estimates”. 2.6 This guide gives “periodogram” estimators for determining the root-mean-square (rms) roughness, rms slope, and power spectral density (PSD) of the surface directly from profile\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: height or slope measurements. The statistical literature uses a circumflex to distinguish an estimator or estimate from its abstract or ensembleaverage value. For example, $\\hat { \\bf A }$ denotes an estimate of the quality A. However, some word-processors cannot place a circumflex over consonants in text. Any symbolic or verbal device may be used instead. 2.7 The quality of estimators of surface statistics are, in turn, characterized by higher-order statistical properties that describe their “bias” and “fluctuation” properties with respect to their abstract or ensemble-average versions. This guide does not discuss the higher-order statistical properties of the estimators given here since their practical significance and use are applicationspecific and beyond the scope of this document. Details of these and related subjects can be found in the references listed in Section 7. 2.8 Raw measured profile data generally contain trending components that are independent of the\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: microtopography of the surface being measured. These components must be subtracted before the difference or residual errors are subjected to the statistical-estimation routines given here. These trending components originate from both extrinsic and intrinsic sources. Extrinsic trends arise from the rigid-body positioning of the part under test in the measuring apparatus. In optics these displacement and rotation contributions are called “piston” and “tilt” errors. In contrast, intrinsic trends arise from deliberate or accidental shape errors inherent in the surface under test, such as a circular or parabolic curvature. In the absence of a-priori information about the true surface shape, the intrinsic shape error is frequently limited to a quadratic (parabolic) curvature of the surface. Detrending of intrinsic and extrinsic trends is generally accomplished simultaneously by subtracting a detrending polynomial from the raw measured data, where the polynomial coefficients are\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: determined by least-squares fitting to the measured data. 2.9 Although surfaces and surface measuring instruments exist in real or configuration space, they are most easily understood in frequency space, also known as Fourier transform, reciprocal or spatial-frequency space. This is because any practical measurement process can be considered to be a “linear system”, meaning that the measured profile is the convolution of the true surface profile and the impulse response of the measuring system; and equivalently, the Fourieramplitude spectrum of the measured profile is the product of that of the true profile and the frequencydependent “transfer function” of the measurement system. This is expressed symbolically by the following equation: $$ A _ { m e a s } ( f _ { x } ) = A _ { t r u e } ( f _ { x } ) T ( f _ { x } ) $$ where: $\\begin{array} { r l } { A } & { { } \\ = } \\end{array}$ the Fourier amplitudes, $\\begin{array} { r l } { T ( f _ { x } ) } & { { } = } \\end{array}$\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 7)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: instrument response function or the measurement transfer function, and $\\begin{array} { r l } { f _ { x } } & { { } = } \\end{array}$ surface spatial frequency. This factorization permits the surface and the measuring system to be discussed independently of each other in frequency space, and is an essential feature of any discussion of measurement systems. 2.10 Figure 1 sketches different forms of the measurement transfer function, $T ( f _ { \\mathrm { x } } )$ : 2.10.1 Case $( a )$ is a perfect measuring system, which has $T \\left( f _ { \\mathrm { x } } \\right) = 1$ for all spatial frequencies, $0 \\leq f _ { x } \\leq \\infty$ . This is unrealistic since no real measuring instrument is equally sensitive to all spatial frequencies. 2.10.2 Case $( b )$ is an ideal measuring system, which has $T \\ ( f _ { x } ) = 1$ for $L F L \\ \\leq \\ f _ { x } \\ \\leq \\ H F L$ and $T ( f _ { x } ) = 0$ otherwise, where $L F L$ and $H F L$ denote the lowfrequency and high-frequency limits of the\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 8)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: measurement. The range $L F L \\leq f _ { x } \\leq H F L$ is called the bandpass or bandwidth of the measurement, and ratio HFL/LFL is called the dynamic range of the measurement. 2.10.3 Case $( c )$ represents a realistic measuring system, since it includes the fact that $T \\left( f _ { x } \\right)$ need not be unity within the measurement bandpass or strictly zero outside the bandpass. 2.11 If the measurement transfer function is known to deviate significantly from unity within the measurement bandpass, the measured power spectral density $( P S D )$ can be transformed into the form that would have been measured by an instrument with the ideal rectangular form through the process of digital “restoration.” In its simplest form restoration involves dividing the measured $P S D$ by the known form of $\\left| T ( f _ { x } ) \\right. ^ { 2 } \\left| \\mathrm { p v e r } \\right.$ the measurement bandpass. Restoration is particularly relevant to measuring instruments that involve\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 9)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: optical microscopes since the transfer functions of microscope systems are not unity over their bandpass but tend to fall linearly between unity at $T \\left( 0 \\right) = 1$ and $T ( H F L ) = 0$ . The need for, and methodology of digital restoration is instrument specific and this guide places no requirements on its use. 2.12 This guide requires that any data on surface finish parameters or functions generated by the procedures described herein be accompanied by an identifying description of measuring instrument used, estimates of its low- and high-frequency limits, $L F L$ and $H F L$ , and a statement of whether or not restoration techniques were used. $2 . 1 3 \\ \\mathrm { I n }$ order to make a quantitative comparison between profile data obtained from different measurement techniques, the statistical parameters and functions of interest must be compared over the same or comparable spatial-frequency regions. The most common quantities used to compare surfaces are their\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 10)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: root-mean-square (rms) roughness values, which are the square roots of the areas under the $P S D$ between specified surface-frequency limits. Surface statistics derived from measurements involving different spatialfrequency ranges cannot be compared quantitatively except in an approximate way. In some cases measurements with partially or even nonoverlapping bandwidths can be compared by using analytic models of the PSDs to extrapolate the PSDs outside their measurement bandwidth. 2.14 Examples of specific band-width limits can be drawn from the optical and semiconductor industries. In optics the so-called total integrated scatter or TIS measurement technique leads to rms roughness values involving an annulus in two-dimensional spatial frequencies space from 0.069 to $1 . 4 8 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ^ { - 1 }$ ; that is, a dynamic range of $1 . 4 8 / 0 . 0 6 9 = 2 1 / 1$ . In contrast, the range of spatial frequencies involved in optical and mechanical scanning techniques are\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 11)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: generally much larger than this, frequently having a dynamic ranges of 512/1 or more. In the latter case the subrange of 0.0125 to $1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ^ { - 1 }$ has been used to discuss the rms surface roughness in the semiconductor industry. These numbers are provided to illustrate the magnitudes and ranges of $H F L$ and $L F L$ encountered in practice but do not constitute a recommendation of particular limits for the specification of surface finish parameters. Such selections are application dependent, and are to be made at the users' discretion. 2.15 The limits of integration involved in the determination of rms roughness and slope values from measured profile data are introduced by multiplying the measured $P S D$ by a factor equal to zero for spatial frequencies outside the desired bandpass and unity within the desired bandpass, as shown in Case $( b )$ in Figure 1. This is called a top-hat or binary filter function. Before the ready availability of digital\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 12)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: frequency-domain processing as employed in this guide, bandwidth limits were imposed by passing the profile data through analog or digital filters without explicitly transforming them into the frequency domain and multiplying by a top-hat function. The two processes are mathematically equivalent, providing the data filter has the desired frequency response. Real data filters, however, frequently have Gaussian or $R C$ forms that only approximate the desired top-hat form that introduces some ambiguity in their interpretation. This guide recommends the determination of rms roughness and slope values using top-hat windowing of the measured $P S D$ in the frequency domain. 2.16 The $P S D$ and rms roughness are surface statistics of particular interest to the optics and semiconductor industries because of their direct relationship to the functional properties of such surfaces. In the case of rougher surfaces these are still valid and useful statistics, although the functional\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope (Part 13)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 2 Scope\n\nContent: properties of such surfaces may depend on additional statistics as well. The ASME Standard on Surface Texture, B46.1, discusses additional surface statistics, terms, and measurement methods applicable to machined surfaces. 2.17 The units used in this guide are a self-consistent set of SI units that are appropriate for many measurements in the semiconductor and optics industry.

Again, the averaged quantities must include the same range of surface spatial frequencies.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.3  bandwidth, bandwidth limits — range of surface spatial frequencies included in a measurement or specification.

The bandwidth and the measurement transfer function over the bandwidth must be taken into account when measurements or statistical properties are compared. Different measuring instruments are generally sensitive to different ranges of surface spatial frequencies; that is, they have different bandwidth limits. Real bandwidth limits are necessarily finite since no measuring instrument is sensitive to infinitelylow or to infinitely-high surface spatial frequencies. 4.2.4 bias error average deviation between an estimate of a statistical quantity and its true value. 4.2.4.1 Discussion — The periodogram estimator of the power spectral density $( P S D )$ given in this guide is a zero-bias or unbiased estimator of the $P S D$ .

The detrended profile is the input for the statistical estimation routines described in Section 5. 4.2.6.1 Discussion — If the parametric form of the trend is known, its least-squares-fitted form can be subtracted from the measured profile data. Otherwise a generic power-series form can be used.

A zeroorder polynomial removes piston; a first-order polynomial removes piston and tilt; and a second-order polynomial removes piston, tilt and quadratic curvature. In each case the detrended data set has zero mean. The coefficients of constant and linear terms correspond to the rigid-body orientation of the part being measured and need not be recorded. However, the coefficient of the quadratic term represents the intrinsic curvature of the surface being measured and should be recorded. 4.2.7 dynamic range — ratio of the high- to lowfrequency limits of the bandwidth of a given measurement technique. 4.2.7.1 Discussion — The ratio HFL/LFL is a useful single-number characteristic of a measuring apparatus.

Estimates of ensemble-average quantities based on a finite collection of measurements (finite ensemble) can deviate from their infinite-ensemble values by fluctuation and bias errors. 4.2.10 estimate ensemble-average value of a roughness statistic from a finite set of measured profile data. 4.2.10.1 Discussion — In this guide, a circumflex is used to distinguish estimates from the corresponding ensemble-average quantities (see also Section 2.6). 4.2.11\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.3  bandwidth, bandwidth limits — range of surface spatial frequencies included in a measurement or specification.

It is now ubiquitous and can be found in any computer data analysis package (see Section 5.4.2 for details). 4.2.13 finish parameters and functions — numbers or functions that characterize surface height fluctuations. 4.2.13.1 Discussion — The values and forms of finish parameters and functions may vary depending on the bandwidth of surface frequencies that they contain, and the shapes of the transfer functions of the measurement\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.3  bandwidth, bandwidth limits — range of surface spatial frequencies included in a measurement or specification.

These quantities are represented by their ensemble-average values derived from measurements using specific estimation routines. In general, the finish parameters and functions of an area are different from those of profiles taken across the surface. In the case of surfaces that are statistically isotropic, however, the area and profile statistics have a one-to-one relationship. Except for incidental remarks, this guide is concerned exclusively with the properties of surface profiles.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.14  fluctuation error — general term denoting the deviation of a quantity from its mean, average or detrended value.\n\n4.2.14.1  Discussion — Fluctuation errors are usually measured in terms of their mean-square or rms values. For example, $R _ { q }$ is the rms fluctuation error in the surface height and $\\Delta _ { q }$ is the rms fluctuation error in the profile slope.  In turn, the estimates of $R _ { q }$ and $\\Delta _ { q }$ have their own fluctuation errors.  The magnitudes of these higher fluctuation errors not discussed in this guide.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.15  high-frequency limit (HFL) $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — highest spatial frequency contained in a profile data set or specification.

If the sampling interval in the measurement process is $D$ , the extreme value of the HFL is given by the Nyquist criterion, $H F L ~ = ~ 1 / ( 2 D )$ . However, other electrical, mechanical, or optical filtering mechanisms may further limit the HFL. Examples of such mechanisms are the stylus tip radius, projected measurement pixel size, optical resolution, and electrical and digital filters, all of which contribute to the high-frequency roll-off of the instrument transfer function. If the Nyquist frequency is used to determine the HFL, care should be taken to determine that the true $H F L$ is not reduced by these additional mechanisms. 4.2.16 intrinsic surface or finish parameters\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.15  high-frequency limit (HFL) $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — highest spatial frequency contained in a profile data set or specification.

They can, however, be inferred from real measurements by augmenting measurements with a-priori information about very low and very high spatial frequencies contained in physically-based models of the PSDs of the surfaces involved. All measured finish parameters are finite, but their corresponding intrinsic values need not be. The important distinction between intrinsic and measured (band-width limited) finish parameters is not always made in the literature. 4.2.17 impulse response, of a profile measuring system measured\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.15  high-frequency limit (HFL) $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — highest spatial frequency contained in a profile data set or specification.

The impulse response of a perfect measuring system would be an infinitely sharp spike or delta function. In contrast, the impulse response of real measuring systems has a finite width. 4.2.18 isotropic surface — surface whose intrinsic finish parameters and functions are independent of the rotational position of the surface about its surface normal. Also known as statistically-isotropic surface. 4.2.18.1 Discussion — The rms roughness of profiles taken across an isotropically rough surface is independent of the profile directions, and equals the rms roughness of the surface area. The rms slope of an isotropically\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.15  high-frequency limit (HFL) $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — highest spatial frequency contained in a profile data set or specification.

The one-dimensional or profile power spectrum of an isotropic surface is also independent of the direction of the profile on the surface, and is related to the two-dimensional spectrum of the surface area by an integral transform. Examples of this are given in Section 4.2.41.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.19  linear systems, linear measurement system — a signal-processing concept more precisely described as a linear, shift-invariant system.

All practical measurement systems are taken to be linear over their operating ranges. 4.2.20 low-frequency limit $( L F L )$ $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — lowest spatial frequency contained in a profile data set or specification. 4.2.20.1 Discussion — The minimum $L F L$ in a profile measurement is the reciprocal of the length of the surface profile. The estimated value of the $P S D$ at this value of the $L F L$ is generally attenuated by the detrending process.

The rms roughness, $\\textit { R } _ { q } ,$ is distinct from the arithmetic-average roughness, $R _ { a }$ . The two are only related through a specific heightdistribution function. For example, for a Gaussian height distribution, $$ R _ { a } = \\sqrt { \\frac { 2 } { \\pi } } R _ { q } = 0 . 7 9 8 R _ { q } $$ Note that the optics literature uses the symbol $\\sigma$ for $R _ { q }$ . 4.2.22 mean-square profile slope, ${ \\Delta _ { q } } ^ { 2 }$ [units of choice] average value of the square of the slope of the detrended profile.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.22.1  Discussion — This expression, given by (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.22.1  Discussion — This expression, given by\n\nContent: $$ \\begin{array} { r } { \\Delta _ { q } ^ { 2 } = \\operatorname { L i m } _ { L \\infty } \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { L } \\int _ { - L / 2 } ^ { + L / 2 } ( \\frac { \\mathrm { d } z _ { d } } { \\mathrm { d } x } ) ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { d } x = \\displaystyle \\int _ { 0 } ^ { + \\infty } ( 2 \\pi f _ { x } ) ^ { 2 } S _ { 1 } ( f _ { x } ) \\mathrm { d } f _ { x } } \\end{array} $$ assumes that the average slope has been removed in the detrending process. The integrand in the frequency integral on the right can be viewed as the slope power spectral density. The mean-square surface slope of an isotropically-rough two-dimensional surface is half the mean-square gradient of the surface itself. 4.2.23 measured profile parameters and functions — quantities derived from detrended profile data that include the bandwidth and transfer function effects of the particular measurement system used. 4.2.23.1 Discussion — Measured profile parameters and functions\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.22.1  Discussion — This expression, given by (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.22.1  Discussion — This expression, given by\n\nContent: can be used for comparing surfaces quality providing the same measurement system is used in all cases. In order to compare quantitative measurements made by different measurement systems, or to estimate intrinsic surface properties, the system bandwidths and transfer functions must be taken into account. In the early literature, measurement systems were taken to be “perfect” in the sense of Section 2.10.1, and the effects of their bandwidths and transfer functions were ignored.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

See Section 4.2.15.1.\n\nContent: 4.2.24.1 Discussion The Nyquist frequency represents the highest undistorted frequency involved in a series of uniformly-spaced profile measurements. Higher-frequency components in the surface appear at lower-frequencies through the process of aliasing. Unless the effects of aliasing are removed by antialiasing mechanisms in the measurement process, they corrupt the measured spectrum immediately below the Nyquist frequency. In that case the HFL should be taken to be a factor of 3 to 5 below the Nyquist frequency. 4.2.25 periodic random roughness — modified version of purely periodic roughness that has a definite fundamental spatial frequency, but random variations in its phase or amplitude (see Section 4.2.26). 4.2.26 periodic roughness — roughness with a definite fundamental spatial frequency. 4.2.26.1 Discussion — The power spectra\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

This pattern is distinct from the broad variations appearing for purely random surfaces. Random surfaces can be viewed as periodic surfaces with a broad distribution of fundamental periods. 4.2.27 periodogram estimate — estimates of particular finish parameters that are derived from the periodogram estimator for the power spectrum. 4.2.28 periodogram estimator — a particular estimator for the power spectral density that is proportional to the square magnitude of the discrete Fourier transform of the detrended data set. 4.2.28.1.1 Discussion — The periodogram is the estimator for the PSD that is used in this guide.

See Section 4.2.15.1.\n\nContent: periodogram. In general, they differ from the periodogram in that they incorporate different types and degrees of a-priori physical or mathematical information about the original data set. The periodogram, in contrast, includes the maximum number of degrees of freedom and is always used for first-cut evaluation and analysis. Details of the correlation and other spectral estimation methods are discussed in the literature listed in Section 7. A mathematical variant of the periodogram estimator is the correlation method. This is a two-step process that requires the estimation of an intermediate function, the autocovariance function, which is then Fourier transformed to obtain the periodogram estimate of the power spectrum. This method is not discussed in this guide since it is indirect, but when properly applied gives identically the same\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

Also known as power spectrum. 4.2.29.1 Discussion — The two conventional measures of surface roughness, ${ \\cal R } _ { a }$ and $R _ { q }$ do not carry any information about the transverse scale of the surface roughness. That is, they are independent of how much the surface profile is squeezed or stretched parallel to the surface plane. The $P S D$ is the simplest statistic that carries that important additional information. 4.2.29.2 profile or one-dimensional PSD of the surface height, $[ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } ]$ — a function of the\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

In this definition the spatial frequency, $f _ { \\mathrm { x } }$ , is always positive and greater than zero.

In the case of an isotropically rough surface the area spectrum is a function only of the magnitude of the two-dimensional frequency vector: $f = \\sqrt { ( \\bar { f } _ { \\mathrm { x } } ^ { ~ 2 } + f _ { \\mathrm { y } } ^ { ~ 2 } ) }$ . The profile spectrum can be derived from the area spectrum, but the area spectrum cannot, in general, be derived from the profile spectrum. Uniaxial and isotropically rough surfaces are exceptions. 4.2.29.4 Discussion of Units: The surface height fluctuations of optical surfaces are usually measured in units of nanometers $\\mathrm { 1 ~ n m = 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ \\mu m } )$ , or the non-SI units of Ångstroms $( 1 \\ \\mathring { \\mathrm { A } } \\ = \\ 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\ \\mu \\mathrm\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

If the average surface profile is written as $\\bar { Z ( x ) = a + b x + c x ^ { 2 } }$ , the estimate of the radius of curvature in the $x$ direction is $\\widehat { R } _ { x } = 1 / ( 2 c )$ .

The fitting process performs a number of important functions: it averages out the fluctuations appearing in individual estimates of the power spectrum, it condenses the data into a few intrinsic surface parameters, and provides a mechanism for extrapolating the measured data outside the measurement bandwidth. 4.2.41.2 One example of a spectral model is the $A B C$ model, which has the following form for the profile $P S D$ : $$ S _ { 1 } ( f _ { x } ) = \\frac { A } { [ 1 + ( B f _ { x } ) ^ { 2 } ] ^ { C / 2 } } $$ and for the two-dimensional spectrum of an isotropically-rough\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

This model is sometimes called the K-correlation model, and the quantity $B / ( 2 \\pi )$ , the correlation length. 4.2.41.3 Another example of a spectral model is the fractal model, which has the following form for the profile PSD: $$ S _ { 1 } ( f _ { x } ) = \\frac { K _ { 1 } } { f _ { x } ^ { C } } $$ and for the two-dimensional spectrum of an isotropically-rough surface: $$ S _ { 2 } ( f ) = \\frac\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

The dimensionless number $C$ usually lies between 1 and 3 but need not be an integer. The quantity $K _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ is sometimes referred to as the spectral strength, and the parameter, $C$ , the spectral index. 4.2.41.4 The fractal model is the limiting case of the $A B C$ model when the finish parameter $B$ becomes very large. The value of the intrinsic mean-square profile and area roughness of the $A B C$ model, obtained by integrating the $A B C$ spectrum over all frequencies, is as follows: $$ R _ { q\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

The intrinsic value of the mean-square roughness of the fractal model is always infinite because of its divergence at low spatial frequencies. In contrast, the measured roughness values, obtained by integrating only over the measurement bandpass, are finite for the $A B C$ model for any value of $C$ , and for the fractal model. 4.2.41.5 A third example of a spectral model is the periodic model, which is for a surface consisting of a periodic structure and has the following forms for the profile PSD: $$ S _ { 1 } ( f _ { x } ) = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { k = \\infty } A _ { k\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # 4.2.24  Nyquist frequency $[ 1 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ]$ — spatial frequency equal to the reciprocal of twice the sampling interval.

As long as the window function performs its function of reducing the contributions from the ends of the data record and has the proper normalization, its shape is of secondary importance. 4.2.46 zero padding — procedure of adding zero values to a data set to bring the total number of data points, $N _ { ; }$ , to a power of two to facilitate the evaluation of the FFT appearing in the periodogram spectral estimate.\n\nSEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # where: (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI MF1811-0704 GUIDE FOR ESTIMATING THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY FUNCTION AND RELATED FINISH PARAMETERS FROM SURFACE PROFILE DATA - # where:\n\nContent: 4.2.46.1 Discussion — The window functions should be applied to the data set before zero padding. Zero padding is less important with the ready availability of arbitrary- $N$ FFT computing packages.",
