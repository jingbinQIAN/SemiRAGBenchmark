    "content": "6.1  This test method consists of va rying the steadystate supply voltage to an MFC in $\\pm 1 \\%$ (of rated supply) increments from the reference voltage span. Both the positive and negative supply voltages will be varied independently and together in $1 \\%$ increments. The MFC flow output is monitored at $0 \\%$ and $100 \\%$ of its operating range (see Table 1).  At each incremental change as well as at the reference supply voltage, the MFC flow and flow standard outputs are recorded at $0 \\%$ and $100 \\%$ of its operating range.  The test shall end when a $\\pm 3 \\%$ of full-scale output flow change is noted between the flow at the reference voltage and at an incremental change point.  A flow chart outlines the procedure (see Figure 1)."

These changes in supply voltages may adversely effect the MFC's ability to deliver setpoint flow.  The magnitude of this effect can be measured by this test method.  \n7.2  The user of an MFC can use th e data generated by this method to evaluate the impact of steady-state supply voltage variations on the MFC's ability to deliver setpoint flow values.  Knowing the magnitude of this effect and the power level variations, allows the user to decide on what measures to take to reduce this effect, if necessary."

R1-1.2 The Static Value as defined in this document (see Section 7.3.4) is a measure of the weekly accumulated mass transfer of contaminant (contaminant flux per week) from the material being tested into static ultrapure water (UPW). The value is calculated based upon measurement of total leached mass of a contaminant per unit area of the surface that was wetted in the test apparatus.

APIMS is currently the method of choice for such dynamic tests because it is the commercially available technique capable of ppt moisture analysis with the fastest response time. This test method may provide guidelines for the application of other techniques with similar detection limits and response time to APIMS which are not commercially available at this time.  \n1.2  The results of this test can be u sed for qualitative ranking of gas delivery based on the design.

Other “inert” gases will have different purging characteristics and may dry a system more quickly or slowly. Reactive gases may react chemically with moisture. Considerations relating to corrosion resistance are outside the scope of the present document, although the test procedure may prove useful in corrosion studies. The results will provide a ranking with respect to moisture contribution arising as a result of differences in design, which may be applied with due caution to systems intended for use in other gas applications. 2.3 Operating Situations — Moist ure contribution from a gas delivery system may be the result of contamination arising in its manufacture, or from subsequent exposure to"

Thus, the results of this test will reflect, by design, any precautions which the supplier has taken to remove moisture and maintain its dryness during shipping. 8.2.1.1 Start the test as in Section 8.1. 1. The test system should not be unpacked until after the APIMS has equilibrated with the background moisture level. If a glove box or other such enclosure is used, unpack the system in the glove box. Switch the dry nitrogen flow to pass through the bypass loop while maintaining a small flow through the test blank.

It does not prescribe a procedure for reverse flow testing since operation of the filter in this manner is not recommended by the manufacturers.  \n3.4  Components that induce line pressure changes on a system such as pressure regulators, and MFCs are not considered in this test method.  \n3.5  Proper flow of low vapor pressure gases can be effected by small pressure drops and may need to be evaluated independently."

Figure A1-12 is the theoretical depth profile of this model assuming a depth of analysis of $5 \\lambda$ . This profile is seen to be similar to the depth profiles generally observed for passivated stainless steel. The Cr:Fe ratio maximum occurs below the initial surface, and the initial surface atomic concentrations of the elements of interest are diluted by the presence of the carbon layer on the surface. The oxide thickness, as measured by the FWHM technique, is affected by both the presence of the carbon layer and the depth of analysis.

Figure A1-12 Theoretical depth profile of Figure A1-11 assuming 5λ depth of analysis. A1-1.12 It must be emphasized that these derived depth profiles are for models with perfect interfaces and perfect compositions instead of the compositional gradients observed in real systems. Additional measurement uncertainties result from roughness and non-planarity of the surface, and from differential sputtering rates for different chemical species during depth profiling. A1-1.13 The depth profiles of real systems must be interpreted with an understanding of the effects described in this Appendix and a realization that they are not ideal. The same considerations pertain to Auger depth profile analysis. NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth"
