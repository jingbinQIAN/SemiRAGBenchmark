A calibration response factor can be determined by regression analysis.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7  Interferences (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7  Interferences\n\nContent: 7.1 It is essential to confirm that th e mass chosen is indeed representative of the species of interest and that other commonly present impurities do not contribute at the same mass. For example: the intensity of the peak at $\\mathrm { ~ m / z ~ } = 2 9$ correlates with the concentration of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ in ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ , because of the $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ formation. However, spurious signal at this peak can arise in two different ways: (i) Contributions of other ions of the same mass, such as $\\mathrm { N } ^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N } ^ { 1 5 + }$ or ${ \\mathrm { C } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { H } } _ { 5 } ^ { + }$ . (ii) Contributions of the same ion from different parent species, i.e., $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ due to recombination of matrix gas nitrogen with fragments of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ , $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ , etc. Before using $\\mathrm { ~ m / z ~ } = 2 9$ as a measure of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ in ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7  Interferences (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7  Interferences\n\nContent: , interference such as these must be understood. This also may apply to other ions. 7.2 High impurity levels can cause clustering with, or quenching of, the other impurity ions and affect the sensitivity of the APIMS for those impurities. This is especially true for impurity levels of $1 0 \\mathrm { p p b }$ and above.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 8  Apparatus\n\n8.1  APIMS — The APIMS used fo r impurity detection can be of any type.  \n8.2  Impurity Standard — Any dev ice (either standard cylinder or permeation tube based or of any other type) that can reliably deliver impurity concentrations usually in the range of $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p p b }$ to $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ with an accuracy of $\\pm \\ : 5 \\%$ . The standards should be traceable to an applicable national standard, such as NIST.  \n8.3  Dynamic Dilution System — A dilution system that can dilute the output gas of the impurity standard with a zero gas to produce a gas with impurity concentrations in the range of interest.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 9  Reagents and Materials\n\n9.1  Zero gas\n9.2  Impurity standard\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 10  Safety Precautions\n\n10.1  This method applies to calibration and measurement of impurities in nitrogen, argon, helium and hydrogen. This method does not address the additional safety precautions for APIMS calibration and impurity measurement in hydrogen gas.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 11  Test Specimen\n\n11.1  Not applicable.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 12  Preparation of Apparatus\n\n12.1  The impurity standard and zer o gas should be connected to the dynamic dilution system, which is in turn connected to the inlet of the APIMS. The entire dilution system should be purged until all impurities have stabilized at a constant dilution system flow, for all components in the dilution system. The relative standard deviation for each analyte should be less than $10 \\%$ for the past 12 hours before the calibration. Constant pressure and flow should be maintained to the APIMS ionization region at all time.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 13  Calibration and Standardi zation (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 13  Calibration and Standardi zation\n\nContent: 13.1 Definition of an Impurity Standard — An impurity “standard” is defined to be any device capable of delivering a flow of known impurity level gas at a controlled pressure. (See Section 8.2.) 13.2 Examples of Standards — Some examples of impurity standards and the principles upon which they are based are as follows: 13.2.1 Cylinder Standards — The “st andard” will include a regulator specified for use with the cylinder. The impurity concentration can be calculated based on that added to the cylinder in preparation. A minimum use pressure must be specified. 13.2.2 Permeation and effusion tube s tandards. These must include purification means and some means of regulating the outlet pressure. The impurity delivery rate can be calculated based on the weight loss of the tube as a function of time. 13.2.3 Moisture standard methods ba sed on saturation of gas with water vapor at a fixed temperature and pressure. The moisture concentration in the gas may then be calculated from a knowledge\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 13  Calibration and Standardi zation (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 13  Calibration and Standardi zation\n\nContent: of the saturation vapor pressure of water over a plane of the pure phase of ice at the saturation temperature and of the interaction virial coefficients of the gas-vapor mixture. The two-pressure and two temperature methods are refinements of this approach requiring additional chambers whose temperature and pressure must be known. 13.3 Dilution of Standards — For a ll impurity generation methods, lower concentrations can be generated by dynamic dilution, i.e., by combining a known flow of the standard gas with a known flow of zero gas. A diluted standard is acceptable provided: 13.3.1 The zero gas should have an im purity level at least an order of magnitude below the stated level of the analysis (to be verified using the same flow path as during the subsequent analysis, and at the lowest flow rate actually used in the calibration). 13.3.2 The absolute accuracy of the d ilution system components are verified by comparison with a reliable flow standard. The frequency of verification must\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 13  Calibration and Standardi zation (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 13  Calibration and Standardi zation\n\nContent: take into account the transport of the instrument and other changes that will affect the dilution system. 13.3.3 The linearity of the dilution sy stem can be demonstrated over the entire range of operation. This last criterion is particularly important whenever some portion of the combined flow is discarded, as mixing problems can easily arise at large dilution factors. 13.4 Mass Calibration — The mass scale of the mass spectrometer should be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions over the mass range of interest. 13.4.1 The validity of the mass select ed for each impurity must be confirmed (i) by demonstrating that the intensity at the mass increases monotomically with added concentration of the impurity species of interest and (ii) that other usually present impurity species do not make significant contributions to the intensity at that mass. Tables 1–4 list the typical masses for various species in argon, nitrogen, hydrogen and helium.

Thus, it is necessary to be sure that the chosen $\\mathrm { m / z }$ represents the ion of interest and that the ion of interest originates from the molecule of interest. Table 2 Common Masses in Nitrogen Bulk Gas NOTE: In APIMS, the same ion may be formed even though different parent molecules are introduced into the ionization region.

Based on prior calibrations, the system should be below 100 ppt, or at least an order of magnitude lower than the lowest calibration point, for the impurities to be calibrated. 14.2 Prior to beginning the calibrati on, record all relevant parameters, such as discharge voltage, lens voltages, ionization chamber pressure and/or flow, gas type, etc. 14.3 The user should use the zero gas only, plus a minimum of 5 challenge concentrations, with a minimum of 5 data points, with the blended data points spanning the range of interest of impurity measurement, excluding the zero point, while maintaining constant flow to the APIMS. Allow each challenge concentration to stabilize for at least 15 minutes, and the signal variation should be less than $3 \\%$ before taking data points at that concentration. Record the relevant ion intensities as a function of time, for each stabilized concentration. 14.4 Once the linearity of the calibr ation has been\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 14  Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 14  Procedure\n\nContent: established, a single point calibration check is permitted, as long as the accuracy of the dilution system is confirmed.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 15  Calculations or Interpreta tion of Results\n\n15.1  Perform a regression analysis for the individual ion intensities against the impurity concentration. Be sure to use only ion intensities below the saturation region of your APIMS ion counting electronics, if using counting detection. (Ask the manufacturer for the saturation region of the units counting electronics.) The ${ \\bf R } ^ { 2 }$ from the fit of all the regression coefficients should be 0.98 or above. If this is not the case, the calibration will have to be repeated as described in the previous section.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 16  Reporting Results\n\n16.1  As a minimum, the calibration will include the following information for each impurity:  \n$$\ny = c _ { 0 } + c _ { 1 } * x\n$$  \nwhere,\n$y$ is the ion intensity, $c _ { 0 }$ is ion intensity\nbackground, $c _ { 1 }$ is the linear response factor, and $x$ is the impurity level.  \n16.2  As an option, a quadratic regre ssion may be reported for the calibration, and will include the following information for each impurity:  \n$$\ny = c _ { 0 } + c _ { 1 } * x + c _ { 2 } * x ^ { 2 }\n$$  \nwhere,  \n$y$ is the ion intensity, $c _ { 0 }$ is ion intensity background, $c _ { 1 }$ is the first order response factor, $c _ { 2 }$ is the second order response factor and $x$ is the impurity level.  \nThe $c _ { 0 } / c _ { 1 }$ ratio or negative $x$ - intercept is useful to define the background concentration of each particular ion. All regression coefficients should be reported.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 17  Precision and Accuracy (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 17  Precision and Accuracy\n\nContent: 17.1 This method does not explicitl y consider the estimation of the accuracy of the impurity standard in detail, because such a calculation can be made by applying procedures described elsewhere. The precision and accuracy required in validation will vary with the proposed application and may be left to the discretion of the user of the method. If an accuracy statement is given, then a propagation of error calculation must be provided to estimate the accuracy of the validation.

When a chemical has characteristics of more than one category, the color scheme should be determined by the most significant health or safety hazard of the chemical. 6.3 Background colors may be app lied to the piping by using pigments, paints, or other means acceptable to the owner; or may be applied as the background color for labels or tags used to identify the contents of the piping system. 6.4 Primary label information con sists of the name of the material contained in the piping system; spelled out in the predominant language of the country or region where the piping system is used. Additional languages may be used to supplement the primary language. Table 1 Piping and Label Color Codes 6.5 Additional information such as the chemical category, chemical formula,\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 6  Recommendations (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 6  Recommendations\n\nContent: acronyms, hazard ratings, or other information may be added, provided that it does not interfere with the primary information required. A separate label may be used for the additional information. 6.6 The color field label length an d lettering sizes shown in Table 2 should be used for all diameters of pipe and tubing. For pipe diameters smaller than $1 2 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.5 inch), the label should be large enough to wrap at least half way around the pipe, and not obstruct the text. If labeling inside equipment, the size of the labels may be adjusted, provided they remain easily seen and readable. Consideration should be given to using tags instead of labels. NOTE: Labeling sizes for piping $1 9 \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.75 inch) or larger in outside diameter were taken directly from ANSI A13.1. Smalle sizes were developed for this guide. 6.7 The height of the label should be at least two times $( 2 \\times )$ the height of the text, with the text centered in the label. The label should allow a length\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 6  Recommendations (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 6  Recommendations\n\nContent: of background color on each end of the text at least one half pipe diameter in length but not less than $1 2 . 7 \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.5 inch). 6.8 The orientation of text on the l abel should conform to local customs, conventions, or practices. 6.9 Directional flow arrows should be applied to all piping systems indicating the direction of material flow within the system. The arrow(s) should be included as part of the primary label but may be applied separately within close proximity to the primary label (e.g., less than $5 \\mathrm { c m }$ (2 inches) for pipe diameters up to $5 \\mathrm { c m }$ (2 inches); less than 15 cm for larger pipe diameters). 6.10 Labels should be applied to the piping system at the following minimum locations: On both sides of a barrier penetration (i.e., walls, floors, ceilings, equipment enclosures, etc.). The labels should be applied within 1 meter (3.3 feet) or as close as practical to the barrier. • As close as practical to all changes in direction where the length of run in\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 6  Recommendations (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 6  Recommendations\n\nContent: the new direction is 1 meter (3.3 feet) or greater. Where several directional changes are made within a short length of run, labels need not be applied at every change in direction, but should be applied at sufficient intervals to readily identify the piping. On long runs, the labels should be applied at intervals not exceeding 6 meters (20 feet). Shorter intervals should be used for small diameter pipe and where several pipes are run in close proximity. Where several pipes are run parallel to each other, the labeling for all pipes should be in line with each other (i.e., should not be staggered). A sufficient number of labels should be applied at each location to ensure that they can be readily seen and read from all viewing or approach direction(s). Each side of a “T” connection should be labeled within 1 meter (3.3 feet) of the “T”.

The tag or tags should contain the same information as defined for labels in Sections 6.4 and 6.5. Standard color-coding for tags should be the same as defined for labels in Table 1. Tags should be installed at the same locations as required for other identification methods defined in Section 6.10.\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7  Related Documents\n\n7.1  ANSI Document  \nANSI Z535.1 — Safety Color Code  \n7.2  BSI Document2  \nBS 1710 — Identification of Pipelines and Services  \n7.3  DIN Document  \nDIN 2403 — Kennzeichnung von Rohrleitungen nach dem Durchflußstoff (Identification Code for Pipe Lines According to Media)  \n7.4  ISO Documents4  \nISO 3864 — Safety Colours and Safety Signs  \nISO/DIS 14726-1 — Ships and Marine Technology — Identification Colours for the Contents of Piping Systems — Part 1: Main Colours and Media (Revision of ISO/R 508:1966) { ISO/R 508:1966 was withdrawn by TC 8 in 1986}\n\nSEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7.5 United States Department of T ransportation Document5 (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F29-0997 (Reapproved 1103) TEST METHOD FOR PURGE EFFICACY OF GAS SOURCE SYSTEM PANELS - # 7.5 United States Department of T ransportation Document5\n\nContent: Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations NOTICE: These standards do not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with their use.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on December 4, 2003.  Initially available at www.semi.org February 2004; to be published March 2004. Originally published September 1998.\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  This test method defines a procedure to monitor the integrity of ultra-high purity (UHP) gas distribution systems by detecting the ingress of atmospheric oxygen. This test method would be used to evaluate an “active” UHP gas distribution system on a continuous basis by using non-invasive $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ measurement, without requiring an interruption of the process tools using the UHP gases of interest.  \n1.2  This test method should be used to protect semiconductor fabrication processes using the UHP gases, which may be sensitive to contamination by any of the common atmospheric impurities, such as ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ , $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ , $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ , before product yield problems develop.  \n1.3  This is the first such test method that describes a noninvasive leak detection and locating procedure. It differs from SEMI F1, which is an invasive technique for identifying leak sources using a mass spectrometer and a helium tracer gas.\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method applies to UHP gas distribution systems used in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and comparable research and development areas. 2.2 This test method applies to bulk gas distribution systems carrying UHP gases such as $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ , Ar, He, $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ , ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ , ${ \\mathrm { S F } } _ { 6 } .$ , and many halocarbons.

There is no capability to identify crosscontaminant species between different UHP gases which only contain ultra-low trace levels of $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ or outward leaks to atmosphere. 3.2 This test method will not focus specifically on the process of detecting the exact location of every possible atmospheric air leakage source.

Compare the baseline “contaminant signature” with the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analyzer’s blank run on zero gas to validate that the analyzer is producing useful data. The base-line “contaminant signature” should exhibit equal or greater $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ variation than the blank run on zero gas.\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 15.2  Problem Identification\n\n15.2.1  Observe data from critical sample point locations and look for deviations (abnormal trends or events) from the baseline “contaminant signature”.  \n15.2.2  Determine if deviations (observed trends or events) are sufficient to impede mandatory atmospheric impurity specifications or influence critical product/process quality.  \n15.2.2.1  If yes, proceed into Section 16.  \n15.2.2.2  If no, continue observing $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ data from critical sample point locations.\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 16  Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 16  Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure\n\nContent: 16.1 Familiarize yourself with Figure 1 before proceeding with the remainder of Section 16. 16.2 Isolate a zone where the contamination is likely to originate from by comparing the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ levels at the critical continuous monitoring sample point locations. Assume the leak source is somewhere between the last uncontaminated sample point and the first contaminated sample point going downstream. Some knowledge of the gas distribution flow path will be required here. 16.3 Compare the data from the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analyzer detecting the contamination with pressure and flow data, or gas usage demand over time in the specific lateral of the gas distribution system where the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analysis is being made. 16.4 Correlate the changes in $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ readings which show abnormally high $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ levels with specific tool cycles that cause the UHP gas pressure and flow in the lateral\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 16  Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 16  Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure\n\nContent: line to change. The timing of the analyzer’s response to these usage demands will give some clues as to the approximate position of the atmospheric leak source. NOTE 3: Back-contamination is likely originating in a leg which is dead at the time the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analyzer responds. Actual response time will depend on the time needed for the contaminant to travel to the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analyzer plus the response time of the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analyzer. 16.5 If no demand cycles in the lateral cause $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ readings to change, then the source of contamination is likely to occur further upstream in the distribution system, prior to the intersection of the lateral in question. This assumes that there is always a net flow of gas in the line leading to the intersection of the lateral being checked. 16.6 Perform an investigative $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ measurement (spot check) with a portable $\\mathbf { O } _ {\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 16  Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 16  Atmospheric Leak Locating Procedure\n\nContent: 2 }$ analyzer at each lateral location that is suspected in causing contamination in the main or sub-main line which supplies the lateral where the contamination was originally detected. Work upstream away from the lateral which showed a sign of contamination. 16.7 Once the lateral with the contamination source has been identified, use the steps outlined in Sections 16.3 and 16.4 to locate the exact point of the atmospheric leak source. 16.8 Refine the selection of investigative sample point locations along with a careful study of system flow dynamics until the leak is pinpointed and repaired. 16.9 Confirm that the leak source has been corrected by providing an investigative $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ measurement downstream of the leak source.\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source\n\nContent: 17.1 See Figure 1 which is a schematic representation of a typical fab branching type gas distribution system. Since a loop type gas distribution system has one less piping level between the main line and the tools, it is more straightforward to monitor and diagnose. This example, although more complex, has been demonstrated in practice. It shows how an atmospheric leak originating at a single tool location can backcontaminate a sub-main distribution line, yet not contaminate all the way back to the main line. In this example, the contamination would not be detected by the UHP analysis instrumentation typically installed on the main line. 17.2 The “contaminant signature” oxygen analyzers are installed at critical purity locations, shown in Figure 1 as $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ , $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ , and ${ \\bf A } _ { 3 }$ .

The excursions take place infrequently at first, but then develop some regularity. Although the absolute $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ level detected does not yet indicate that the potential atmospheric leak $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ and ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ included) would pose a direct risk to the critical purity of process tools located nearby, it does differ significantly from the baseline “contaminant signature”. This prompts an investigation before a fullscale process production problem results. 17.2.2 Each of the lateral lines being monitored by ${ \\bf A } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 }$ shows the same level of $\\mathbf { O\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source\n\nContent: } _ { 2 }$ contamination, so it is deduced that the contamination is coming from the sub-main line which feeds both laterals. Since analyzer $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ does not show the contamination, it is further deduced that the leak source is located between $\\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ and ${ \\bf A } _ { 2 }$ . 17.3 Working back upstream along the sub-main, investigative $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ measurements are made at each lateral location ahead of the ${ \\bf A } _ { 2 }$ lateral. These investigative $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ measurements are made using a portable $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ analyzer per Sections 12 and 13. 17.4 At $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathbf { S } _ { 2 }$ , similar $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ contamination events are observed as compared with points $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 }$ . Further, no lateral line flow changes (due to tool gas demand cycles in those laterals) cause any change in the $\\mathbf { O } _\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source\n\nContent: { 2 }$ level. 17.5 At the third lateral, sampled as $\\mathbf { S } _ { 3 }$ in Figure 1, the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ level is significantly higher (ranging between 5–10 ppb), with periodic spikes of $5 0 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \\ { \\mathrm { p p b } }$ . At this point, it is observed that when the usage in lateral $\\mathbf { S } _ { 3 }$ drops to zero (a dead leg condition), analyzers $\\mathbf { A } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { 3 }$ show $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ readings above the “contaminant signature”. It is therefore deduced that the ${ { \\bf { S } } _ { 3 } }$ lateral is the source of the atmospheric leak. 17.6 By correlating the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ data at ${ { \\bf { S } } _ { 3 } }$ with the gas usage from the tools on this lateral, the leak source can be further traced within this lateral. (Refer to Figure 2.) 17.6.1 When Tool-1, Tool-2, or Tool-3 demands gas, the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ reading drops in proportion to the total\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source\n\nContent: flow of gas in the lateral line. The higher flow rates act to dilute the effects of the leak source and thus lower the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ reading at ${ { \\bf { S } } _ { 3 } }$ . 17.6.2 It is observed that when Tool-5 demands gas, there is no change in the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ reading at ${ { \\bf { S } } _ { 3 } }$ . Therefore, it is deduced that the leak source is located further out along the lateral line. 17.6.3 When Tool-4 demands gas, it causes a more significant drop in the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ reading at ${ { \\bf { S } } _ { 3 } }$ . Further, it is observed that the time required for the analyzer to respond after Tool-4 begins demanding gas correlates to the time needed for the analyzer’s sample flow alone to purge down the lateral line volume up to the analyzer, when Tool-1, $^ { - 2 }$ , and -3 are not demanding gas. 17.6.4 This deductive inference technique pinpoints the leak source to the Tool-4 lateral line. 17.6.5 After\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source (Part 6)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 17  Example in Locating Leak Source\n\nContent: Tool-4 has stopped demanding gas (yet before any other Tools on this lateral demand gas), the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ reading at $\\mathbf { S } _ { 3 }$ continues to drop gradually over several minutes. It then gradually begins to elevate once again. This indicates that the actual leak is not very close to the connection of Tool-4 at the lateral line. It suggests more that the leak source is closer to the tool itself. 17.7 A final investigative sample point is selected along the line leading to Tool-4. This is shown as $\\mathrm { \\Delta S _ { 4 } }$ in Figure 2. It is observed that the $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ readings drop to $0 . 2 \\mathrm { - } 0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { p p b }$ when Tool-4 demands gas. $ { \\mathbf { S } } _ { 4 }$ begins to show an $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ elevation after the Tool-4 stops demanding gas. This concludes that the leak source is originating from Tool-4 itself.\n\nSEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 18  Related Documents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F35-0304 TEST METHOD FOR ULTRA-HIGH PURITY GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTEGRATION VERIFICATION USING NON-INVASIVE OXYGEN MEASUREMENT - # 18  Related Documents\n\nContent: 18.1 SEMI Standard SEMI E49.8 — Guide For High Purity And Ultrahigh Purity Gas Distribution Systems In Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment NOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.

Current edition approved by the North American Regional Standards Committee on July 11, 2004.  Initially available at www.semi.org September 2004; to be published November 2004.  Originally published February 1999.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The purpose of this test method is to define a method for determining numerical values for surface roughness parameters measured on gas distribution system components. Application of this method is intended to yield comparable data among users of this method.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 2  Scope\n\n2.1  This document will specify methods, measuring equipment, and test conditions for mechanical profile surface roughness measurement of gas distribution system components. This test method will not require nor recommend numerical values for specific surface roughness parameters. This test method is intended for use in quality control and process development for specification of and manufacturing of gas distribution system components.  \nNOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the users of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  Numerical values for specific surface roughness parameters obtained using this test method may not provide sufficient information for determining the performance of the component, such as dry down times, corrosion resistance or amount of particle generation. Surface roughness measurement is one of many evaluation techniques for assessing the performance or quality of a surface. This document is not concerned with characteristics such as component design, material, dimensions, appearance, etc. While surface defects traversed by the stylus may be included in the roughness measurement, this method does not govern the evaluation of surface defects. Surface defects may be measured by methods such as SEM and EDX. This test method is intended to measure surface features on the order of $1 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in size.  It is not intended to detect submicron surface features.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 4.1  ASME Standards1\n\nB46.1 Surface Texture (Surface Roughness, Waviness, and Lay)  \n4.2  ASQ Standards  \nZ1.9 — Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Variables for Percent Nonconforming  \nNOTICE: Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited shall be the latest published versions.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 5  Terminology (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: 5.1 Abbreviations and Acronyms 5.1.1 EDX ⎯ Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy 5.1.2 SEM ⎯ Scanning Electron Microscopy 5.1.3 SEM ⎯ Scanning Electron Microscope 5.2 Definitions 5.2.1 cutoff ⎯ a length selected to limit the spacing of surface irregularities. It separates a surface's roughness from its waviness. 5.2.2 distinct regions ⎯ visually unique areas of a surface defined by patterns of lay or differences in the appearance of surface roughness. In-line bores of different sizes or orientations and each leg of a shaped component should be considered distinct regions. 5.2.3 evaluation length ⎯ the actual length over which surface roughness is assessed. 5.2.4 lay ⎯ the general direction of orientation of surface features. 5.2.5 skid ⎯ a stylus probe support which acts as both a filter and a datum for probe movements. 5.2.6 skidless ⎯ a type of instrument that does not use an external skid attached to the probe to act as a datum. Instead, it references a datum plane\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 5  Terminology (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 5  Terminology\n\nContent: internal to the measurement equipment. 5.2.7 stylus ⎯ the object which mechanically probes the surface. 5.2.8 surface roughness ⎯ the finer irregularities of the surface texture, usually including those irregularities that result from the inherent action of the production process, for example traverse feed marks from cutting tools [ASME B46.1-1995]. 5.2.9 surface texture repetitive or random deviations from the nominal surface that forms the three-dimensional topography of the surface. Surface texture includes roughness, waviness, lay, and flaws [ASME B46.1-1995]. 5.2.10 waviness ⎯ the more widely spaced component of surface texture. Waviness may result from such factors as machine or workpiece deflections, vibrations, chatter, heat treatment, or warping strains. Roughness may be considered as superimposed on a “wavy” surface.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 6  Sampling\n\n6.1  Acceptability criteria should be specified by the user and be developed in accordance with published sampling plans such as ASQ Z1.9, Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Variables for Percent Nonconforming.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 7  Apparatus\n\n7.1  The instrument should be a stylus type as defined by ASME B46.1, Section 2.  Due to the limitations of skidded instruments (Type IV and V), a skidless instrument (Type I) is preferable.  \n7.2  The instrument should be calibrated using standard laboratory practices and manufacturer's recommendations with a roughness metrology standard calibrated by a certified testing laboratory and traceable to NIST3.  \n$7 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { { I n } }$ order to resolve the features of the surface, a stylus with a conical tipped radius of $5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ $( 2 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { i n } )$ should be used.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 8  Units of Measure\n\n8.1  Surface roughness should be described by means of the Roughness Average, $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ , as defined per ASME B46.1.\n8.2  Measurements should be specified in micro-meters $( \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ or microinches $( \\mu \\mathrm { i n } )$ .\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 9  Preparation of Apparatus\n\n9.1  The surface should be clean and free from loose debris before taking a measurement.  \n9.2  The instrument should be sufficiently isolated from vibrations, which will artificially increase roughness measurements.  \n9.3  Surfaces inaccessible to the stylus probe may be exposed by sectioning a sample(s).  Samples should be sectioned to avoid damage to the surface to be measured and should be cleaned appropriately to remove sectioning debris.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 10  Procedure\n\n10.1  Select a single random location for measurement within each distinct region of interest on each component.  \n10.2  Measurements shall be taken perpendicular to the lay. If this is not practical, measurements may be taken in the direction of process gas flow through the component.  \n10.3  Instrument cutoff length should be set to 0.800 mm (0.030 in.).  \n10.4  The evaluation length, or measurement length, should be at least $3 . 8 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.150 in.) where sufficient length is available.\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 11  Reporting\n\n11.1  Average $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ is defined as the average of all $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ measurements taken over a population.  \n11.2  Maximum $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ is defined as the maximum of all $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ measurements taken over a population.  \n11.3  Both Average $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and Maximum $\\mathbb { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ should be reported for a given population. A population can be defined as:  \na set of single measurements on multiple components\na set of multiple measurements on a single component\na set of multiple measurements on multiple components\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 12  Precision and Accuracy\n\n12.1  Some variance in Roughness Average is to be expected on a single surface from measurement to measurement. No two measurements (as taken by different operators, on different instruments, or at different locations on the surface of a component) will contain the same data points. Because different instruments will acquire data points at different rates, and evaluation lengths may differ, a typical Roughness Average measurement can include hundreds to tens of thousands of data points. Reported measurements on the same surface can be expected to deviate up to $20 \\%$ .\n\nSEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 13  Related Documents (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F37-0299 (Reapproved 1104) METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM COMPONENTS - # 13  Related Documents\n\nContent: 13.1 ANSI Standard Y14.36 ⎯ Surface Texture Symbols 13.2 BSI Standard5 BS 1134 ⎯ Assessment of Surface Texture, Part 1: Methods and Instrumentation and Part 2: Guidance and General Information 13.3 DIN Standard6 DIN 4768 ⎯ Determination of Surface Roughness Values $\\mathbf { R } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ , $\\mathbf { R } _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ , $\\mathbf { R } _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } }$ with Electric Stylus Instruments 13.4 ISO Standard7 ISO 4288 ⎯ Rules and Procedures for the Measurement of Surface Roughness Using Stylus Instruments 13.5 JIS Standard8 JIS B 0651 ⎯ Instruments for the Measurement of Surface Roughness by the Stylus Method NOTICE: SEMI makes no warranties or representations as to the suitability of the standards set forth herein for any particular application.

Originally published June 1999.\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 1  Purpose\n\n1.1  The purpose of this document is to define a comprehensive standard test sequence to qualify the particle filtration efficiency achievable using Point-ofUse (POU) gas filters.\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 2  Scope (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 2  Scope\n\nContent: 2.1 This test method defines an evaluation method for Point-of-Use filters of various media (e.g., metallic, ceramic, and polymeric) typically used for filtering inert and process gases in semiconductor applications. Point-of-Use filters are designed to handle relatively low flow rates $( 0 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 5 0 \\mathrm { ~ } \\mathrm { s l m . } )$ and moderately high pressure drops. The filter housing and filtration element are combined into one sealed and inseparable unit. 2.2 This test method is intended to demonstrate the ability of a Point-of-Use gas filter to equal or exceed a specific particle filtration efficiency class when challenged with a monodispersed aerosol in the size range described in Section 6.6. 2.2.1 The efficiency class of the test method is defined as the log reduction value (LRV), where LRV is the Log [Input Concentration/System Background Level].

Therefore, many challenge tests have to be performed over a range of particle sizes to assure that the “worst case” challenge has been performed. 3.4 The efficiency test is for steady state flow and room temperature only. Comparison to efficiency in pulsed flow, elevated temperature etc., will have to be developed separately. 3.5 Statistical evaluation on the variability in efficiency of a media type should be done with a valid sample size. This evaluation is not within the scope of this test method. 3.6 The upper concentration limit of the CNC as specified by the manufacturer should not be exceeded.

The CNC must meet a background level as specified in Section 7.1.2. 6.3 Test Environment — Particle challenge testing does not require a clean area. Testing in a Class 100 area is recommended but not required. Refer to Section 6.7 for installation precautions. 6.4 Configuration for Efficiency Test — One example of the configuration is shown in Figure 1. The setup shown in Figure 1 is intended only as a guideline. This system consists of: an aerosol generation system, aerosol concentration detectors, an air flow measuring system, a filter pressure drop sensor, and the test filters. 6.5 Test\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 6  Apparatus and Facility (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 6  Apparatus and Facility\n\nContent: Flow Rate — Maximum manufacturer’s rated flow rate. 6.6 Challenge Particle Sizes — Experimentation of various media (e.g., metallic, ceramic, and polymeric) have resulted in most penetrating particle sizes ranging from 0.05–0.11 micron.1 2 3 4 6.6.1 Several monodispersed particle challenge tests shall be done over a range of particle sizes so that testing at the most penetrating particle size is performed. An electrostatic classifier must be used to produce a monodispersed challenge. 6.6.2 Due to the effects of particle loading in relation to filtration efficiency, a clean filter should be used for each particle size challenge. The differential pressure across the test filter should be continuously monitored to eliminate the possibility of particle loading. The following particle increments are a guideline. Smaller increments are achievable and are desirable. 6.6.2.1 Challenge Particle Size In Microns: 0.05 0.07 0.10 6.7 Sample Installation — Reasonable precautions shall be taken when\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 6  Apparatus and Facility (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 6  Apparatus and Facility\n\nContent: installing the test filter to avoid particle contamination of the system from ambient. These precautions may include, but are not limited to: installation in a Class 100 laminar flow area, installation in a purged glove bag or other controlled ambient enclosure, use of a purge flow downstream of the sample point so that all parts of the system are under purge, isolation, or termination of the CNC sample flow, and isolation of the isokinetic sampler exhaust from ambient. 6.8 Customary practices shall be employed for the design of the sampling system. This includes any specialized equipment or procedures recommended by the CNC manufacturer. Every effort should be taken to minimize differences in the particle concentrations of the sampling volume relative to the actual test volume. Care should be taken to provide an adequate exhaust length so that back diffusion of particles does not affect background at 2 times the sampling flow rate. This length will depend upon the particle concentration\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 6  Apparatus and Facility (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 6  Apparatus and Facility\n\nContent: in the ambient environment and on other factors. 6.9 Test Particle — Solid non-volatile particles. Sodium chloride is recommended, but other particles could be used such as polystyrene latex beads (PSL) if sufficiently high concentrations can be generated.\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.1  Static Background Test\n\n7.1.1  Purge the system at a high velocity flush of 100 slm or the maximum flow rate that the system components will allow.  \n7.1.2  Purge the system at test flow rate (Section 6.5). Measure the particle concentration with clean gas to determine the background concentration. The background count is established when the counter has sampled a minimum of 3 scf (85 sl), and the arithmetic average during the last 3 scf (85 sl) of gas sampled is <2 particles/scf $( < 0 . 0 7$ particles/sl).  The sample interval shall be 1 minute in duration.  Ensure that the background counts are stable or decreasing.  If background cannot be achieved after 6 scf (170 sl) have been sampled, there may be a problem with the counter or test apparatus.  Past experience has shown this to be an adequate volume of gas to give a satisfactory low level background particle counts.\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.2  Penetration Test (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.2  Penetration Test\n\nContent: 7.2.1 An example of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1. The input particle concentration is measured by CNC-B, while the output particle concentration is measured by CNC-A. The pressure and flow rates in both legs should be carefully balanced (by maintaining an identical differential pressure in both legs) to insure that the challenge level is the same. 7.2.2 Set the first and subsequent challenge particle sizes per Section 6.6. 7.2.3 Particle challenge concentrations should be set to the maximum output of the electrostatic classifier for each of the particle size tests (Section 6.6). This will determine the test volume and the duration of the test. Generally this requires generating a polydispersed aerosol having a mean size close to the desired monodispersed aerosol size. Any difference between the flow rate exiting the electrostatic classifier and the test flow rate specified in Section 6.5 will be made up by dilution gas as shown in Figure 1. 7.2.4 The total particle challenge must be\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.2  Penetration Test (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.2  Penetration Test\n\nContent: limited to $1 \\times \\ 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ particles per liter of filter rated flow in slm. This is done to limit the effects of a particle cake buildup which would enhance the efficiency of the test filter. The test should be concluded upon exposure to $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ particles per liter of rated flow or after 10 downstream counts are observed, whichever occurs first. 7.2.4.1 As an example, a 10 liter per minute filter would be challenged in one minute with $( 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { s l m } ) \\times ( 1 \\$ minute) $\\times ( 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ particles/liter) or $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 }$ particles. If the challenge concentration is $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ particles per liter and the flow rate is $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { s l m }$ , then the test would need to last 10 minutes or when 10 downstream particles were observed. 7.2.4.2 The sample interval shall be 1 minute in duration. The sample interval in the penetration test is equivalent to the sample interval in the system background test (Section 7.1.2).\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.2  Penetration Test (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 7.2  Penetration Test\n\nContent: 7.2.5 Measure the input and output particle concentration. 7.2.6 Calculate the ratio of output to input particle concentration.\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 8  Reporting of Test Results\n\n8.1  Raw data shall be reported for each test in the format of a table, including the number of sample intervals, the sampling volume of each interval, the sampling time of each interval, and the total number of particles registered in each interval.  In addition, the relevant parameters for each test described in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 should be identified.  \n8.2  Static Background Test — Identify the period of time required to obtain 45 consecutive sampling intervals without a particle being detected for the spool piece and test filter.  \n8.3  Penetration Test — Identify the input concentration, the output concentration, the ratio of output to input concentration (fractional penetration), and the challenge particle size.  The most penetrating particle size is the challenge particle at the largest fractional penetration. Care must be taken to distinguish between true penetration and system background counts (see Section 8.5) as measured in Section 7.1.2.\n\nSEMI F38-0699 (Reapproved 1104) TEST METHOD FOR EFFICIENCY QUALIFICATION OF POINT-OF-USE GAS FILTERS - # 8.4  Efficiency Class\n\n8.4.1  If no penetration is observed then report the POU Gas Filter passed a X LRV efficiency test, where $\\mathbf { X } = \\mathbf { \\partial }$ the maximum detectable efficiency for the test (as defined in Section 2.2).

Each type of component should be pretreated and prepared according to the procedures of this document before it can be tested using the identified chemical test methods.  \n2.3 This document defines prepara tion and pretreatment procedures used for the evaluation of liquid chemical distribution system components in test fluids.  This practice is intended for use with $49 \\%$ HF, $30 \\%$ $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ , $2 9 \\%$ $\\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } O H }$ , IPA and ultrapure water.  The document defines the purity of chemicals that can be used for leaching and rinsing liquid chemical distribution system components.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 3  Limitations\n\n3.1  Although ozonated water is co mmonly used in ultrapure water systems, no provisions are made in this document for evaluations using ozonated water. Therefore, some of the procedures may not be directly applicable to ozonated water.  \n3.2  The preparation procedures de scribed in this practice primarily involve static testing including agitation.  Dynamic testing, i.e., continuous flow, may alter the chemical test results.  Static component preparation procedures are not directly applicable to dynamic testing.  \n3.3  This preparation procedure app lies to ambient temperature only with the exception of ultrapure water which may be tested at ambient temperature and up to $8 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .  \n3.4  Filter cartridges are not covere d in this document due to the requirement for dynamic testing.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 4  Referenced Documents\n\n4.1  None.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Acronyms and Abbreviations  \n5.1.1  DSC   differential scanning c alorimetry\n5.1.2  FEP   fluorinated ethylene-p ropylene\n5.1.3  FTIR — Fourier transform inf rared spectroscopy\n5.1.4 $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ — hydrogen peroxide\n5.1.5  HF — hydrofluoric acid\n5.1.6  IPA — Isopropyl alcohol\n5.1.7  NH4OH — ammmonium hydroxide\n5.1.8  NVR — nonvolatile residue\n5.1.9  PE — polyethylene\n5.1.10  PFA — perfluoroalkoxy\n5.1.11  PP — polypropylene\n5.1.12  PVDF — polyvinylidene fluoride\n5.1.13  TGA  thermal gravimetric an alysis\n5.1.14  TOC — total organic carbon\n5.1.15  UPW — ultrapure water\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 5.2  Definitions\n\n5.2.1  blank extraction  A containe r of test fluid which does not see the component under test.

Sample size requirements for bulk analyses are listed in Table 2.  \n6.3  This practice should be performed before analysis by industry standard extraction and bulk test methods used to evaluate liquid chemical distribution component.  Available industry standard test methods are listed in Table 3 and the Related Documents section.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 7  Apparatus and Materials\n\n7.1  Containers, as defined in Table 1  \n7.1.1  All containers and caps used in component and blank extraction should be thoroughly cleaned.  A typical recommended cleaning procedure is outlined in Section 11.3.  However, any cleaning procedure is acceptable as long as the subsequent blank extraction yields impurity concentrations that do not exceed $10 \\%$ of the specification for the material being tested.  For example, if a given impurity is specified for a maximum of $\\mathrm { i . 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / c m } } ^ { \\mathrm { - } }$ , the blank extraction concentration should not exceed $0 . 1 \\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ .  \nNOTE: In situations where the detection limit is greater than $10 \\%$ of the specification for the polymer material, the detection limit of the instrument converted into $\\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ will suffice, provided it does not exceed the specification for the material being tested.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 7.2  Test Fluids (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 7.2  Test Fluids\n\nContent: 7.2.1 For purposes of this practice , references to water shall be understood to mean ultrapure water as defined by maximum individual metal and anion impurity levels of 0.1 parts per billion by weight $1 \\times 1 0 ~ ^ { - 9 }$ (ppbw) or less, total organic carbon (TOC) levels of 10 ppbw or less, nonvolatile residue levels of 0.1 parts per million by weight $1 \\times 1 0 ~ ^ { - 6 }$ (ppmw) or less, resistivity of 18 megohm-cm or greater, and reactive silica impurity of less than $1 . 0 \\mathrm { p p }$ . 7.2.2 References to HF, $\\mathrm { \\Delta N H _ { 4 } O H }$ and $\\mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ shall be understood to refer to chemicals with a minimum of a semiconductor grade purity and meet the criteria in section 7.1.1.

A clean environment may require the use of a cleanroom (for those procedures which can be performed in a cleanroom).  \n8.2.2  For all testing other than differ ential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the component preparation should take place in a controlled environment to minimize contamination.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 9  Sampling and Test Specim ens\n\n9.1  The components selected for t esting should reflect the current manufacturing capabilities of the supplier.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10  Procedure for Preparing C omponents and Collecting an Extraction Sample for Analysis\n\n10.1  Component preparation for co ntaminants that can be leached from liquid chemical distribution components is different from component preparation for bulk polymer analysis.  Components are flushed and then soaked to extract surface contamination.  Refer to Table 1 for procedures for handling specific components.  \n10.2  The liquid chemical distributio n system components described in this section are divided into two groups:  \na) Components that require capping (see Section 9.5).  \nb) Components that require a container (see Section 9.6).  \n10.3  Each group is discussed individually. Use Table 1 to determine the appropriate group for each component.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.4  General Procedure (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.4  General Procedure\n\nContent: 10.4.1 The blank extraction is a conta iner of test fluid without a component which follows the entire procedure and is handled in the same manner. Please consult the specific test method for the number of test fluid samples to be prepared and the statistical treatment. This would include a number of containers for both component and blank extractant. Use cleaned containers that meet the criteria specified in Section 7.1.1. An example of a cleaning procedure is outlined in Section 11.3. 10.4.2 Use UPW to fill and then drain the component or container 10 times. After each fill, leave the water in the component or container for two minutes before draining. 10.4.3 Fill an 11th time with the appr opriate test fluid (see Section 2.3); use this fill for the test. Refer to Table 1 to determine the soak time for each component or container. 10.4.4 Agitate once a day for one min ute. Orbital shakers or manual agitation can be used, but no foreign materials may contact the test fluid; therefore, stir\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.4  General Procedure (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.4  General Procedure\n\nContent: bars cannot be used. Components and/or containers are to remain sealed during agitation to prevent splashing or spilling. Components in containers (such as gaskets) should remain completely submerged throughout the extraction.\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.5  Components that Require Capping (Tubing, Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings) (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.5  Components that Require Capping (Tubing, Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings)\n\nContent: 10.5.1 This practice is appropriate for static samples with one end permanently sealed and one end loosely capped. Since the sealing process may contaminate the sample, one end should be sealed prior to precleaning. Use cleaned caps meeting the criteria specified in Section 7.6.1. The cap must be manufactured from the same material as the component or from a compatible material that will not contaminate the sample. 10.5.2 As surfactants and solvents ma y leave a residue that could alter the test results, do not use them for precleaning. 10.5.3 During sample collection for metal analysis, the components must be acid stabilized to a pH of 2 (approximately 3 drops of concentrated nitric acid per $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of UPW) to stabilize for certain trace metals (i.e., iron and chromium). 10.5.4 Tubing and piping: Fill the component with test fluid to within one inch of the top of the component to allow free space for\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.5  Components that Require Capping (Tubing, Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings) (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.5  Components that Require Capping (Tubing, Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings)\n\nContent: agitation. In the case of tubing or pipes, to maximize the exposed surface area of the pipe to the volume of fluid and to minimize the surface area of the end cap, it is recommended that the ratio of the surface area of the pipe to the surface area of the end cap be 10 or greater. The equation to determine the ratio is 4L/D, where L is the length of the pipe or tubing and D is the diameter. 10.5.5 Valves, regulators, and fittings: To allow for maximum fluid volume, fill valves, regulators, and fittings with the appropriate test fluid to within five mL of the top to allow for agitation. Multiple components may be required to obtain the necessary volume for the test. Valves, regulators, and fittings must be capped at both ends. In the case of valves, this practice assumes that normally opened valves will be used. 10.5.6 Filter housings: Fill the compo nent with the appropriate test fluid to within one inch of the top of the\n\nSEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.5  Components that Require Capping (Tubing, Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings) (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F40-0699PRACTICE FOR PREPARING LIQUID CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONCOMPONENTS FOR CHEMICAL TESTING - # 10.5  Components that Require Capping (Tubing, Piping, Valves, Regulators, and Filter Housings)\n\nContent: housing to allow free space for agitation.

While the sampling considerations and timing make the initial tool qualification a natural adjunct to the BCDS qualification, the responsibility for this task generally falls within a different jurisdiction and is generally handled separately.\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 4.1  SEMI Documents\n\n4.1.1 SEMI S-2 Safety Guideline for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment  \n4.1.2  SEMI E-4 — Guide for Standard Performance, Practices, and Sub-Assembly for High Purity Piping Systems and Final Assembly for Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment  \n4.1.3  SEMI F31 — Guide for Bulk C hemical Distribution Systems\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 5  Terminology\n\n5.1  Acronyms and Abbreviations  \n5.1.1  BCDS — Bulk Chemical Distr ibution System  \n5.2  Definitions  \n5.2.1  pickling — To condition the B CDS by exposing to an aggressive chemical that extracts impurities from the internal surfaces of the system.  \n5.2.2  sample — Sample taken from a system into a sampling container and measured off-line.\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n\n\nContent: 6.1 Advantage of Pre-Chemical Q ualification — The pre-chemical qualification is designed to ensure that the piping systems and storage tanks are able to accept chemicals. This step is often initiated after the UPW system is functional and an acceptable resistivity is achieved but before chemicals are authorized to be brought on-site. Although UPW does not extract high levels of metallic and ionic impurities from the BCDS materials of construction, this step can ensure that the BCDS and distribution piping is free of any gross contamination that may have been introduced into the system during installation. In addition, the UPW flush can be effective for the elimination of some types of particles. 6.2 Particle Qualification The B CDS is flushed with UPW and the levels of particles are measured using an on-line optical particle counter. The steps followed include: 6.2.1 Install an acceptable UPW wa ter filter element(s) per the filter and BCDS manufacturer's specifications.\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n\n\nContent: 6.2.2 Fill the BCDS with UPW and r ecirculate internally to ensure that all piping is filled with UPW. 6.2.3 Begin sampling to a liquid par ticle counter downstream of the filters either at the outlet of the BCDS, the POU, or both. Follow an approved particle counting sampling procedure. 6.2.4 Continue recirculating and flus hing until the particle concentrations in the desired channel or channels are observed at levels below the agreed-upon specification. An example of typical specification is the average of five consecutive ten minute readings of $\\mathbf { \\xi } < \\mathbf { X }$ particles/ml ${ \\mathcal { Q } } \\geq \\mathrm { Y }$ micron. 6.3 Metallic Qualification Afte r reaching the particle specification for the UPW, a sample of UPW may be taken for trace metal analysis. This sample can be taken at the outlet of the BCDS, at an end point sample station and/or at the POU. An appropriate sample bottle precleaned for this test should be used to collect a sample. The\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n\n\nContent: sample bottle should be preconditioned before use and contamination-free techniques used for the actual sampling. 6.3.1 The steps to follow are: 6.3.1.1 Fill the sample bottle with the required volume for the analytical method to be used. The volume varies depending on analytical procedures and lab instrumentation. 6.3.1.2 Send samples to a designated l aboratory capable of performing trace metal analysis. Use only a laboratory that has experience with these types of samples and that can test reliably in the sub-ppb range. The number of elements and concentrations that are to be analyzed will vary depending on customers’ requirements. 6.3.1.3 Evaluate data and compare to the agreed-upon specification. A typical specification is $\\mathbf { \\ < X }$ ppb total and $\\mathrm { < X }$ ppb per element. 6.3.1.4 If the trace metal specification is not met, drain or flush the entire BCDS and distribution piping and repeat the process. 6.3.1.5 If a maximum level of impurit ies is\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 6  Pre-Chemical Qualificatio n\n\nContent: desired, a sample of the UPW used to charge the system should be tested to establish a baseline and to ensure that the incoming UPW is not the source of high impurities. 6.3.1.6 Once the BCDS has been qual ified for particles and trace metals in UPW, the qualification of the BCDS in Chemical may be initiated.\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System\n\nContent: 7.1 Advantages of Conditioning th e System Another precleaning step that may be used independently or in conjunction with a UPW flush is to condition the BCDS by actively flushing it with an aggressive chemical that extracts impurities from the internal surfaces of the system. This step is sometimes referred to as \"pickling\" the system. This extra step can help minimize the amount of time consumed in the qualification process by utilizing a chemical with more aggressive extraction properties than the actual chemical to be used in the line, thereby increasing the rate at which impurities are removed. This can shorten the amount of time needed until the actual chemical can be put into the line and shown to meet the qualification specifications. Since a goal of a well-designed qualification protocol is to minimize the amount of high purity chemical flushed to drain during the qualification process, this approach may also prove to be more cost effective depending on the\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System\n\nContent: cost of the chemical used for pickling, compared to the cost of the process chemical designated for use in the line. 7.2 Conditioning With Same Chem ical A variation on the above approach is to \"pickle\" the system with the process chemical that is intended to be used in the BCDS line a 24-72 hour soak period and flushing the chemical to drain. While the process chemical may not be as aggressive in cleaning up the line, this approach has the advantage that the extracted metals have the same fingerprint as those that might otherwise be observed during the final qualification testing, and the final qualification may be done immediately following this step, without further preparation. 7.3 Testing the Preconditioning Ch emical Rather than relying on an arbitrary or predetermined lengths of time for preconditioning the BCDS, test samples are often taken and analyzed to ensure that the required level of impurities has actually been obtained. This testing is often\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System\n\nContent: commissioned by the equipment manufacturer and not reported to the customer as part of the BCDS qualification. Indicator elements are often analyzed that are either of particular concern in the process chemical, or elements such as Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Na, Ni, and Zn, that are known as common impurities in chemicals and that are also highly detrimental in semiconductor processing. 7.4 Conditioning Procedure Th e three most common chemicals (HCL, HF, and HNO3) used for precleaning the BCDS are aggressive in extracting metallic impurities and particles. The steps followed include: 7.4.1 Install an acceptable chemical filter element(s) per the filter and BCDS manufacturer's specifications. 7.4.2 Fill the BCDS and distribution piping with the chemical of choice and recirculate internally to ensure that all piping is filled. This may include all distribution piping. Let the chemical soak the materials of construction in a static manner for a period of 24 to 72 hours, or\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System (Part 4)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System\n\nContent: continue recirculating the chemical as a closed loop for the same amount of time. 7.4.3 Flush the chemical from the sy stem. 7.4.4 Depending on the chemical us ed, a UPW rinse step or an inert gas purge step for drying may be required prior to filling the system with the actual chemical for the qualification testing. Note: The precleaning chemicals used may add undesirable contaminants (i.e. $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { F } } ^ { - }$ from Hydrofluoric acid, Cl from hydrochloric acid, etc.). Therefore, if any of these chemicals are used, additional testing may be required to determine that these materials have not added contaminants in excess of any specification. These contaminants may be tested in the UPW rinse step or in the final chemical qualification step. 7.5 Solvent Systems The type o f chemical used for flushing solvent BCDS systems is different than that used for oxidizers and corrosive chemicals since solvent systems can be made from stainless steel and metal\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System (Part 5)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 7  Chemical Conditioning of The System\n\nContent: materials for reasons of safety and chemical compatibility.

The sampling points are generally coincident with the location of pre-existing sample ports on the Valve Manifold Box, day tank and other distribution points. The adequacy of the sampling points depends on their accessibility, environmental controls, ability to flush prior to sampling, and safety considerations. 8.1.2 Adequacy of data. Due to s ampling error, possibility of environmental contamination, handling problems, and impurities in sampling containers, samples should be taken in duplicate or triplicate, with two samples sent to the lab for testing and one sample retained in case of a dispute. 8.1.3 Use of proper precleaned samp ling containers. Sampling containers must be chemically\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 8  Final Chemical Qualificati on (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 8  Final Chemical Qualificati on\n\nContent: compatible and precleaned in a manner consistent with the desired specification level for impurities.

The proper training is required to ensure that personnel charged with sampling follow appropriate safety and contamination-free protocols. 8.2 Particle Qualification For m ost accurate results, particle levels should be measured on-line with a optical particle counter capable of measuring the size of particle that is included in the guaranteed specification. Batch samples may be taken and measured for particles in a lab, but special care is needed to prequalify containers used for this sampling, and data integrity may be compromised for the smallest sized particles due to various contamination sources. An example of a protocol generally followed to measure particle on-line includes: 8.2.1 Remove all UPW in the BCDS and distribution piping. 8.2.2 Remove UPW filters or replace incompatible chemical filters if present. 8.2.3 Install specified filter\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 8.1.4  Use of a contamination-free sa mpling device for samples pulled from an open vessel or a drum.

Follow a prescribed particle counting sampling procedure. 8.2.9 The number of particle sample s and sample duration time should be calculated based on the total volume of chemical desired to be examined by the particle counter. A \"sufficient\" volume of chemical should be examined by the particle counter during the qualification period. As an example, the particle concentration could be measured over\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 8.1.4  Use of a contamination-free sa mpling device for samples pulled from an open vessel or a drum.

In this example, the average of the last consecutive 30 samples would be calculated and compared to the specification. 8.2.10 The particle concentration is considered acceptable if the average is less than the specification. 8.3 Metallic Qualification Meta llic impurities are generally specified both in terms of level of impurity by element and total amount of impurities. The customer's specification generally lists each element to be included in the analysis or may refer to the list of elements published by SEMI for each chemical at different purity grades. The maximum impurity levels may be described as an absolute value (e.g. 1ppb maximum impurity), or in terms of the quantity of impurities that may be added by the BCDS including the distribution piping. This amount of \"total adders\" is determined by measuring the impurity\n\nSEMI F41-0699 GUIDE FOR QUALIFICATION OF A BULK CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USED IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING - # 8.1.4  Use of a contamination-free sa mpling device for samples pulled from an open vessel or a drum.

The number of samples and location of samples vary depending on the type of specification. When qualifying to a “metallic impurities added” specification, a sample must be taken from the incoming chemical supply drums for an incoming baseline. The testing protocols includes: 8.3.1 Precondition all sampling bott les before use and follow appropriate sampling protocol. 8.3.2 Send samples to a lab for trace metal analysis specifying the level of testing required and the number of elements to be tested. The level of testing required depends on the agreed upon specification. As a rule of thumb, the detection limits of the analysis should be at least 10X's lower than the impurity level to be achieved for each element. In addition, the lab should follow high",
