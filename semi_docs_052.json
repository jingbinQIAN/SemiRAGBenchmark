Wall tap sample ports are oriented $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to the process line flow as shown in Figure R1-1.  Non-isokinetic flow into the sample tube results from the $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ change in flow direction.  Additional deviation from isokinesis can result from stream tube contraction or expansion when the velocities $\\mathrm { ~ U ~ }$ and v are not equal.  The effects of non-isokinetic flow on the measurement should be checked.  The particle sampling process should be performed with an aspiration efficiency close to 1.  \nR1-2  Variables"

The resolving power of the instrument near 0.2 micrometer should be no worse than $10 \\%$ .  The counting efficiency is determined by a calibration at $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ Pa (1 atmosphere) pressure using polystyrene latex spheres in an inert gas and a reference particle counter with a proven counting efficiency of not less than $9 5 \\%$ at 0.2 micrometer.  \nNOTE 2:  Suitable test methods for determining counting efficiency and resolving power are contained in Japanese Industrial Standard JIS B 9921 (1989), “Light Scattering Automatic Particle Counter”.

APIMS is currently the technique of choice for such tests because it is essentially the only commercially available method capable of ppt moisture analysis and because of its superior response time. This method may provide guidelines for the application of other techniques with similar detection limits and response time to APIMS which are not commercially available at this time.  \n1.2  The results of this test can be used for qualitative ranking of systems and components and can also be used, by a sufficiently sophisticated user, as input for numerical simulation of distribution system behavior."

The following components are expected to yield meaningful results when tested according to the present method: tubing, connectors (fittings), particle filters, valves (check, relief, shut-off, and metering), regulators, flow-through transducers/sensors, mass flow controllers and meters. Components with dead volumes, such as pressure gauges, can be tested according to this method, but the results will be difficult to interpret. Additional criteria besides those considered here need to be developed for testing components with dead volumes. 2.1.1 As gas phase moisture levels are dominated by desorption from surfaces, the procedure is expected to be most useful for components of large surface area such as particle filters and tubing.

It does not address the purge condition after the change of the cylinder (post-purge) nor the purge of the entire gas source system which is usually performed following its initial installation or during maintenance (maintenance purge).  \n3.2  Because the response time of moisture and oxygen analyzers utilizing different technologies can differ significantly, this can lead to the possibility that different instruments will report different peak heights when measuring identical contaminant spikes.

It is important to note that the definition of the “test valve” is inclusive of all connections and fittings, as supplied by the manufacturer. This specifically differs from the ISA procedure, whereby a method is provided to differentiate the pressure drop contribution of the attached fittings. It is recognized that flow coefficients may vary slightly depending upon the end connection used. Examples of typical test valves are shown in Figure 1."

For incompressible fluids, ISA provides a relatively simple method for determining $C _ { \\nu }$ .

It has been determined through considerable testing that the expansion factor is critical in calculating actual pressure drops across a valve when flow rates cause the fluid density to change due to pressure and velocity changes."

However, the alternative test procedure of ANSI/ISA-S75.02, Section 7.3 will give the correct values of $C _ { \\nu }$ and $x _ { T }$ in this case. 9.2.5 The ISA alternative method determines the pressure drop ratio factor by measuring flowrate vs. pressure ratio, and analyzes the data to compute the choked flow pressure drop ratio, $x _ { T }$ .
