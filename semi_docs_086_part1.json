The test is not a valid method for comparing the moldability of different compounds since a spiral flow test cannot duplicate actual molding conditions in different types of molds.  \n3.2  The moldability of thermosetti ng molding compounds has generally been defined by a single spiral flow number. The ram follower device follows graphically the molding compound as it melts and the rate of flow increases, as viscosity builds up due to resin polymerization, and as the flow of the compound ceases. Thus, it measures the gelation point of the compound, or the point where the material ceases to flow. This information can be an aid in characterizing the rheological behavior of the molding compound.\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 4  Apparatus\n\n4.1  Transfer Molding Press — Wi th a platen area sufficient to maintain a uniform mold temperature and having (1) a transfer piston pressure potential of 1000 psi on the material; (2) sufficient clamping pressure to prevent flashing of the molding compound; and (3) a minimum plunger speed of $2 5 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ (1 inch) per second without load. The pot diameter shall be 31.75 to $4 4 . 4 5 \\pm 0 . 6 3 5 \\mathrm { { m m } }$ (1.250 to $1 . 7 5 0 \\pm 0 . 0 2 5$ inch) and the clearance between pot and ram shall be sufficiently small that flashing does not occur above the first sealing groove on the ram.\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 4.2  Standard Spiral Flow Mold — Per ASTM D 3123.\n\n4.3  Ram Following Apparatus — Consisting of a displacement transducer attached to the transfer ram of the press in such a way as to accurately record its movement, suitable power supply for the displacement transducer, and a recorder capable of recording the signal from the displacement transducer and preferably having a chart speed of at least $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ per second. An optional velocity transducer can also be used as a means of directly measuring ram velocity and verifying the starting and ending of the flow process. In this case, a 2-channel recorder is needed.  \n4.4  Thermocouple and Potentiome ter — Calibrated in the $1 4 9 ^ { \\circ }$ to $1 7 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ( $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { F } )$ range. (Calibration to be checked every six months.)\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 5  Test Conditions\n\n5.1  Molding Compound — Refrigerated shipment and storage of some molding compounds is necessary. The molding compound is to be at room temperature before the container is opened. Once the compound has equilibrated to room temperature, the test should be run within 16 hours. Care must be taken to preserve the original moisture content. The material should be in powdered form, unless otherwise specified.  \nNOTE: Room temperature defined to be $2 3 ^ { \\circ } \\pm 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$  \nNOTE: Refer to manufacturers' recommendations regarding shelf life differences which may exist between molding compounds.  \n5.2  The Spiral Flow Mold — Shal l be clean and free from any mold release agents or lubricants. A standard mold cleaning compound can be used to insure mold cleanliness.\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 5.3  Molding Conditions (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 5.3  Molding Conditions\n\nContent: 5.3.1 The temperature of the mold s hall be measured using a thermocouple inserted in the mold. The ram shall be kept at the mold temperature. Molding temperature is to be as recommended by the material specification unless otherwise specified. Temperature must be maintained within $\\pm \\nobreakspace 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ $( \\pm \\ : \\ : 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { F } )$ of the specified temperature. NOTE: Flow duration is strongly influenced by temperature. For critical determinations, the temperature should be maintained as close to the nominal temperature as practical, preferably within $\\pm 0 . 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\left( \\pm 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { F } \\right)$ . 5.3.2 The weight of the charge shall be adjusted to give a molded cull thickness of $3 . 3 0 2 ~ \\pm ~ 0 . 2 5 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ $( 0 . 1 3 0 \\pm 0 . 0 1 0 \\mathrm { i n } .$ ), excluding vertical flash. 5.3.3 The free running ram speed sh all be at least 25.4 $\\mathrm { m m / s e c }$ (1\"/sec).\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 5.3  Molding Conditions (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 5.3  Molding Conditions\n\nContent: Recommended speed is $1 0 0 ~ \\pm ~ 2 5$ $\\mathrm { m m / s e c }$ into the pot and application of pressure on the charge shall not exceed 5 seconds. 5.3.4 The transfer pressure measured under the transfer plunger is to be $6 . 8 9 5 \\pm 0 . 1 7 7 { \\mathrm { ~ n ~ } }$ pa ( $1 0 0 0 \\pm 2 5 \\$ psi) unless otherwise specified. 5.3.5 Unless otherwise specified, a m inimum of 1.5 minutes close and cure time shall be used. 5.4 Flow Length — Read the spira l flow length directly from the molded specimen at the point of farthest continuous flow to the nearest $6 . 3 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.25 in). 5.5 Flow Duration — The flow du ration or gel time is defined as the time interval between the moment when the ram contacts the charge and the time the ram stops moving. The contact and gelation points are determined from the ram follower trace.\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 6  Procedure for Spiral Flow (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 6  Procedure for Spiral Flow\n\nContent: 6.1 Thoroughly clean the ram, pot , and mold of any cured compound, or other foreign matter. 6.2 Heat the mold and ram to with in $( \\pm \\ : 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ of the specified temperature. 6.3 At the beginning of each series of tests and at each change of compound, check and set the transfer pressure using the force gage. The proper force gage setting can be determined from the formula: $$ F = \\frac { \\pi D ^ { 2 } P } { 4 } $$ where $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ is the force in pounds, $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ is the desired pressure on the material in psi and $\\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is the ram diameter in inches. 6.4 For each material change, mak e at least three “clean out” runs using the material to be tested before recording data. These runs may be used to determine the charge weight. 6.5 Weigh out the compound to th e nearest $\\boldsymbol { 0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { \\ g } }$ as previously determined to yield a cull of $3 . 3 0 2 \\pm 0 . 2 5 4$ mm ( $\\mathrm { 0 . 1 3 0 \\pm 0 . 0\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 6  Procedure for Spiral Flow (Part 2)\n\nTitle: SEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 6  Procedure for Spiral Flow\n\nContent: 1 0 ~ i _ { \\mathrm { l } } }$ n.). 6.6 Raise the ram, add the compou nd to the pot, and immediately activate the transfer cycle. If the recorder does not have a remote on-off that is activated by the cycle start, then it should be started before the cycle starts. After the ram motion ceases, the chart may be stopped. 6.7 Open mold and remove cured material. Measure cull thickness. If the cull is not within $3 . 3 0 2 \\pm 0 . 2 5 4$ mm $\\mathrm { 0 . 1 3 0 \\pm 0 . 0 1 0 \\ i }$ n.), discard run and repeat the test, adjusting the charge weight as necessary. 6.8 Read the flow length to the ne arest $6 . 3 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (0.5 in.). 6.9 Mark the point on the chart wh ere the ram contacts the charge. This point is identified on the displacement trace as the point at which the rate of displacement initially changes. 6.10 Mark where the ram stopped moving. Caution should be exercised where significant flashing occurs. Count the number of divisions between the two points\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 6  Procedure for Spiral Flow (Part 3)\n\nTitle: SEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 6  Procedure for Spiral Flow\n\nContent: and divide by the chart speed. The result is the flow duration or gel time in seconds. Record this time to the nearest second. 6.11 If the optional velocity trace is available, mark point on the chart where the ram contacts the charge. This point is identified on the velocity trace as the point at which the transfer velocity transducer initially detects a significant reduction in velocity output. 6.12 Mark where the ram stopped moving. In order to detect the point of zero (0) velocity, the signal must be of sufficient magnitude. Count the number of divisions between the two points and divide by the chart speed. The result is the flow duration or gel time in seconds. Record this time to the nearest second. 6.13 If both displacement and velocity transducers are used, the starting and ending points should agree, therefore yielding the same gel time. 6.14 Repeat step 6.5 at least 3 times for repeatability.\n\nSEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 7  Reporting of Results (Part 1)\n\nTitle: SEMI G4-0302 SPECIFICATION FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LEADFRAME MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPED LEADFRAMES - # 7  Reporting of Results\n\nContent: 7.1 Report the material designatio n and lot number. 7.2 Report the average and standa rd deviation of the flow length and gel time. 7.3 Report the temperature and pre ssure used for the tests.
