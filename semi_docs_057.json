These requirements are defined by the physical installation environment, local and national code interpretations, process requirements, and delivery specifications. 5.2 System Installation The UP W system is installed according to a protocol that ensures mechanical integrity, leakproof operation, and no or minimal contamination being added from distribution throughout the system. 5.3 Acceptance Tests Acceptan ce tests are conducted on each subsystem or system produced. Such tests may include performance demonstrations, demonstrations of reliability criteria, and achievement of purity standards. Such tests are the basis for acceptance or rejection by the purchaser against a prenegotiated set of criteria for the performance of the system. 5.4 Qualification Testing Quali fication testing may include tests for"

Action limits are generally set to determine when system performance suggests that corrective action is required. 5.6 UPW specifications UPW s ystems are generally guaranteed to deliver a certain quality of water on an ongoing basis. The guaranteed performance is established in advance between the UPW equipment manufacturer and the system owner. Both qualification testing and monitoring testing use the guaranteed specifications to determine the parameters and levels of purity to be tested. 5.7 Recycle/Reclaim Opportunitie s There can be several opportunities for using water within a UPW system, and should be recognized during the design phase when possible.

The raw water to a UPW system is most frequently treated Municipal Drinking Water. 6.2 Municipal Drinking Water Most natural raw waters must be treated in order to produce drinking water that meets federal and state requirements. There are upper limits for inorganic contaminants (e.g., asbestos, arsenic, copper, and lead), pesticides, volatile organic chemicals (e.g., benzene, trichloroethylene, toluene, and xylene), turbidity, microbiological contaminants, and radiological contaminants (e.g., radon 226, radon 228, tritium, and strontium 90). Municipal Water Treatment may utilize only chlorination, or filtration and chlorination for certain ground water sources.

Pretreatment equipment may include media filtration, micro filtration, or ultrafiltration (bulk suspended solids removal), 1–5 micron cartridge filtration (polishing step for suspended solids removal), sodium-cycle cation exchange (softening, to remove scale-forming cations), acid injection (to minimize cellulose acetate membrane damage and/or to control carbonate scales), scale inhibitor injection (to control scaling), activated carbon filtration (to remove oxidizing agents and certain organic molecules), and sulfite ion injection (to remove oxidizing agents). 7.2 Reverse osmosis Membrane T reatment provides extremely high rejection of dissolved ions"

Reverse osmosis (RO) units may be configured in a double-pass arrangement consisting of two RO membrane units in series. Permeate (filtered water) from the first RO unit is sent to the second RO unit to be filtered again. It is not uncommon for the permeate from a double-pass RO unit to have a resistivity reading up to 0.5–4 Megohmcm, with less than one milligram per liter of organic and silica contaminants. The more contaminants removed in the membrane treatment step, the lower the loading on the Polishing steps. 7.3 Volatiles Removal The removal of dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, other gases, and volatile organic compounds is a necessary treatment step.

Ionic, organic, and silica contaminants are removed in typically two stages of Ion Exchange in series (primary beds and polishing beds). Organic compounds, measured as TOC (Total Organic Carbon, or Total Oxidizable Carbon), that are found downstream of the RO membrane units may be subjected to TOC Reduction ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (185 nanometer low pressure units or medium pressure units) to convert most of them into ionic compounds that can be effectively removed by Primary Ion Exchange Units (usually consisting of Separate Beds, Mixed Beds or EDI/CDI/E-Cell).

Each loop consists of UPW that continuously recirculates through appropriate piping from the final filters, to the manufacturing areas requiring UPW (end users), and back to a tank located within the Polishing section to be polished again.  The UPW to the end-user area is commonly called the  \nSupply.  The UPW that travels from the end-user area back to the water treatment area is commonly called the Return.  Ozone may be injected into the Supply and/or Return line to control microbiological contaminants and also to enhance the action of TOC breakdown in downstream TOC reducing UV units. Sometimes ozone is injected into the Supply line for similar reasons (requires de-ozonation at the end-use points). Sometimes the UPW in the distribution loop is heated (hot loop) for particular processes."
