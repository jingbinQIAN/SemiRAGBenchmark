Very little of the original intent of SECS-I has been altered, although there are a few significant additions. The changes are summarized in Appendix 1. This specification has been developed in cooperation with the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association Committee 12 on Equipment Communications. 1.2 Scope — The SECS-I standard defines a communication interface suitable for the exchange of messages between semiconductor processing equipment and a host. Semiconductor processing equipment includes equipment intended for wafer manufacturing, wafer processing, process measuring, assembly and packaging. A host is a computer or network of computers which exchange information with the equipment to accomplish manufacturing.

The actual transmission consists of 8-bit bytes sent serially with one start and one stop bit. The communication is bidirectional and asynchronous, but flows in one direction at a time. The direction is established by special characters and a handshake, after which the data itself is sent. Data is sent in blocks of 254 bytes or less. Each block consists of a 10-byte header followed by data. A message is a complete unit of communication in one direction and consists of 1 to 32,767 blocks.

Most of the protocol is accomplished with a handshake of single bytes. When both ends of the line try to send at the same time, a condition known as line contention exists. The protocol resolves contention by forcing one end of the line, designated as the slave (always the host), to postpone its transmission and enter the receive mode. Retransmission of blocks is used to correct communication errors. The block transfer protocol is shown in flow chart form in Figure 2, and described below.

A timeout occurs when the measured time between two events exceeds a predetermined limit. Generally, the length of time that must pass before it can be assumed that an error has occurred depends upon the particular systems involved. The time required in one situation might be excessively long in another. Thus, the timeout values must be \"tuned\" to meet the application. In the block transfer protocol, there are two situations requiring timeout values. The two timeout values are called parameters T1 and T2. 5.3.1 Inter-Character Timeout, $^ { T I } \\mathrm { ~ - ~ }$ The intercharacter timeout, T1, limits the time between receipt of characters within a block after the length byte has been received and until the receipt of the second checksum byte. 5.3.2 Protocol Timeout, T2 — The p rotocol timeout, T2, limits the time between sending ENQ and receiving EOT, sending EOT and receiving the length byte, and sending the second checksum byte and receiving any"

The SECS-I protocol both predates the ISO/OSI model and is not a true \"open system\" and, therefore, does not correspond exactly to the ISO/OSI model. The SECS-I protocol is a communications interface rather than a network protocol. However, the SECS-I levels can be roughly compared to layers 1 through part of layer 5 of the ISO/OSI model. ISO/OSI layer 1, the physical link layer, corresponds to the SECS-I physical link. ISO/OSI layer 2, the data link layer, corresponds to the SECS-I block transfer protocol. lSO/OSI layer 3, the network layer, is a function of the host and is not defined in SECS-I beyond the provision for a bidirectional flow (see Section 6.2). Similarly, network management is assumed to be the responsbility of the host. ISO/OSI layer 4, the transport layer, is covered by the SECS-I block transfer protocol, duplicate block"

R1-1.3 Stalling (see Section 5.8.2) — The line control portion of the block transfer protocol has the ability to delay the acceptance of a data block by not responding with an EOT immediately after receiving an ENQ. Such an action by the receiver is called \"Stalling.\" If the delay exceeds the sender's T2 value, the sender will send another ENQ. This can be continued depending upon the sender's setting of T2 and RTY. Such a delay should be an occasional convenience to accommodate random short delays in the receiver's ability to accept a new block and should not be counted upon routinely to make up for poor response.

This allows one block to be inspected by the message protocol while the next block is being received, thus allowing a reasonably continuous reception of data. If both buffers are full and the message protocol is slow in freeing the buffer for the block transfer protocol, then the block transfer protocol will start stalling the sender. If the sender is stalled long enough, it will declare a send error, which is probably the correct thing to do. The sender cannot distinguish between a reluctance to receive and failure in the communications. In either situation, since no block gets through in a predetermined time limit, the communications link is effectively broken. Arbitrarily long delays are not acceptable in SECS-I.

This works while listening for an EOT after sending an ENQ. In the case where the sender is listening for an ACK after sending the second checksum byte, it is possible that the receiver also has a block to send, and follows the ACK immediately with an ENQ. In this case the last character in the buffer might be an ENQ, and so the last two characters should be examined. If an ACK precedes the ENQ, then it should be assumed that the block was sent successfully, and the ENQ should be saved for establishing line control (i.e., send an EOT, or an ENQ if there is contention).

Third, it does error detection on incomplete messages whether they are due to a break during multiple blocks or a lack of reply messages. The third function is vital to the maintenance of a working system, as can be seen from the following discussion. Once a transaction is begun with the first block of a primary message, the receiving machine will have some memory allocated to buffering or pointing to interpreting modules. If the transaction remains incomplete for some reasonable length of time, it may be assumed that an error has occurred and the receiving machine should release any memory it may be holding for the transaction.

Once a transaction is begun, there will exist a timer on the time interval between all blocks of the transaction independent of the direction of the message. The machine that expects to receive a block has the burden of timing and error detection. Timers are required in any machine that (1) makes a request and expects to receive data back; (2) must receive multiple block requests; or (3) sends data and expects an acknowledgement.

These messages are organized into categories of activities, called streams, which contain specific messages, called functions. A request for information and the corresponding data transmission is an example of such an activity. 2.1.2 SECS-II defines the structure of messages into entities called items and lists of items. This structure allows for a self-describing data format to guarantee proper interpretation of the message. 2.1.3 The interchange of messages is governed by a set of rules for handling messages called the transaction protocol. The transaction protocol places some minimum requirements on any SECS-II implementation. NOTICE: This standard does not purport to address safety issues, if any, associated with its use.

The term interpreter will refer to the entity that interprets the primary message at its destination and generates a reply when requested. 6.3 Blocking Requirements — The message transfer protocol must support the following SECS-II message blocking requirements. 6.3.1 Single-Block Messages — SECS-II requires that certain messages be sent in a single block or single packet by the message transfer protocol. Those messages defined in this standard as single-block SECS-II messages must be sent in a single-block or packet. The method used by the application software to tell the message transfer protocol that a particular message must be sent as a single block is not covered as part of this standard. For compatibility with SECS-I, the maximum length allowed for a single-block SECSII message is 244 bytes.

Because there are many different encoding schemes and the information could be in any one of a number of languages, these characteristics must also be included in the item. Thus for localized character strings which use item format code 22 (octal), there is an additional localized string header (LSH) . 9.4.1 This localized string header follows the item header and precedes the string. The localized string header is part of the item data, thus the length of the header (2 bytes) is included in the length in the item header.

The comma can be read as meaning ‘and’. ‘on’ and ‘off’ are sub-states of ‘pump’. ‘vent’, ‘rough’, and ‘Hi-V’ are sub-states of ‘vacuum’. The sub-state syntax is ‘state/sub-state’ where the $\\cdot \\boldsymbol { \\mathbf { \\mathit { I } } } ^ { , }$ can be read as ‘is in substate’.

The stuck material condition is determined by the amount of time the material transfer mechanism is turned on. The sender claims stuck material if the material is not clear of its sensor before a time t1. The receiver claims stuck material if the material is not received before time t2.

Zero-length records are allowed. Each record from the data set is sent as a single item in a message. 2.

Recovery may be attempted by issuing a CLOSE, followed by an OPEN with the last value of Checkpoint, and then another READ. 10.17.2.9.2 Each secondary message for the READ transaction must contain a whole number of Discrete records. A record may be sent as an ASCII or a binary item. Stream data sets are broken into pieces by the READ transaction without regard to internal structure. Each piece would be sent as a single binary item. The number of items which contain data depends on the RecordType, Record Length, and Read Length. The algorithm is designed so that the maximum length of the secondary message is deterministic. It gives the receiving system the ability to control the amount of resources (such as SECS-I buffers) which it must allocate. The sending system may send less data than the maximum if it has limited resources. The performance (i.e., the packing of records into a message of some maximum"

This is assumed to be the usual case. The efficiency in pathological cases (e.g., many short records) will not be good, but the algorithm is robust enough to accommodate this without exceeding the maximum message size. NOTE 13: If the RecordType is Stream, then there is exactly one item with a binary format whose length is not more than ReadLength. If the RecordType is Discrete, then the maximum number of items, MaxItems, is calculated by the formula: $$ \\mathrm { M a x I t e m s } = \\mathrm { m a x } \\left( 1 , \\mathrm { i n t } \\left( { \\frac { \\mathrm { R e a d L e n g t h } } { \\mathrm { R e c o r d L e n g t h } } } \\right) \\right) $$ 10.17.2.9.3 The size of the secondary message may be less because of limited resources in the sending system. 10.17.2.9.4 For data sets with Discrete records, the format of each item is either ASCII (format 20) or binary (format 10).

It is not necessary to issue CLOSE transactions for each individual data set because the RESET transaction is a global close. 10.17.2.15 Any equipment which uses Stream 13 must issue the RESET transaction as part of its initialization or bootstrap procedure.
